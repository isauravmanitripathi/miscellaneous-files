permanent settlement that flourished between 2800 BCE and 1800 BCE, practised
agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made
tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well-planned

systems and the existence of a
form of municipal government.

#### West Coast

Maritime trade was carried out extensively between and and West Asia from early times
until around the fourteenth century CE. Both the and were the sites of important trading centres from as early as the first
century BCE, used for import and export as well as transit points between the
region and southeast
Asia. Over time, traders organised themselves into associations which
received state patronage. This state patronage for overseas trade came to an
end by the thirteenth century CE, when it was largely taken over by the local
Parsi, Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim communities, initially on the
Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.

#### Silk Route

Other scholars suggest trading from India to West Asia and Eastern Europe was
active between the 14th and 18th centuries. During this period,
Indian traders settled in , a suburb of greater , Azerbaijan. These
traders built a ,
which suggests commerce was active and prosperous for Indians by the 17th
century.

Further north, the "Saurashtra

role in maritime trade, and the and the housed several centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was
carried out via the connecting

rulers issued coins, was prevalent. Villages
paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while
their craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their
services.

### Mughal, Rajput, and Maratha eras ")]

See also: and The Indian economy was the largest and most prosperous throughout world
history and would continue to be under the , up until the 18th century. Sean Harkin estimates that
China and India may have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of world GDP in the
17th century. The Mughal economy functioned on an elaborate system of
currency, land revenue and trade. Gold, silver and
copper coins were issued by the royal "Mint
\") which functioned on the basis of . The political
stability and uniform revenue policy resulting from a centralized
administration under the Mughals, coupled with a well-developed internal trade
network, ensured that India–before the arrival of the British–was to a large
extent economically unified, despite having a traditional agrarian economy
characterised by a predominance of .
Agricultural production increased under Mughal , with Indian
agriculture being advanced compared to Europe at the time, such as the
widespread use of the among Indian
peasants before its adoption in European agriculture, and possibly higher
per-capita agricultural output and standards of consumption than 17th century
Europe.

The Mughal Empire had a thriving industrial manufacturing economy, with India
producing about 25% of the world's industrial output up until 1750,
making it the most important manufacturing centre in . Manufactured
goods and from the Mughal Empire
were sold throughout the world. Key industries included textiles,
, and steel, and processed
exports included cotton textiles, ,
"Thread \"), silk, products, , and foods such as
sugar, oils and butter. Cities and towns boomed under the Mughal Empire,
which had a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time, with 15% of
its population living in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the
urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and higher than that of
in the 19th century.

In ,
there was significant demand for products from Mughal India, particularly
cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers,
, silks, and ).
, for example, became increasingly
dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks. From the late 17th century to
the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted for 95% of from Asia, and the
province alone accounted for
40% of from Asia. In contrast, there was very little demand for
European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-sufficient. Indian
goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in large quantities to
other Asian markets, such as and
Japan. At the time, was the most important centre of cotton textile production.

In the early 18th century the declined, as it lost western, central and parts of south and north
India to the , which
integrated and continued to administer those regions. The decline of the
Mughal Empire led to decreased agricultural productivity, which in turn
negatively affected the textile industry. The subcontinent's dominant
economic power in the post-Mughal era was the in the east., which continued to
maintain thriving textile industries and relatively high . However, the former was devastated
by the and then in the mid-18th
century. After the loss at the , the Maratha
Empire disintegrated into several confederate states, and the resulting
political instability and armed conflict severely affected economic life in
several parts of the country – although this was mitigated by localised
prosperity in the new provincial kingdoms. By the late eighteenth
century, the British had entered the Indian political theatre and established its
dominance over other European powers. This marked a determinative shift in
India's trade, and a less-powerful effect on the rest of the economy.

### British era ")]

— The
global contribution to world's GDP by major economies from 1 CE to 2003 CE
according to Angus Maddison's estimates. Up until the 18th century, China
and India were the two largest economies by GDP output.

From the beginning of the 19th century, the British 's gradual expansion
and consolidation of power brought a major change in taxation and agricultural
policies, which tended to promote commercialisation of agriculture with a
focus on trade, resulting in decreased production of food crops, mass
impoverishment and destitution of farmers, and in the short term, led to
. The economic
policies of the caused a severe
decline in the and
sectors, due to reduced demand and
dipping employment. After the removal of international restrictions by
the , Indian trade expanded substantially with steady growth. The
result was a significant transfer of capital from India to Britain, which, due
to the colonial policies of the British, led to a massive drain of revenue
rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the domestic
economy. The economy of the was the
"List of regions by past
GDP \") up until the onset of in early 19th century.

US$according to .
However, Maddison's estimates for 18th-century India have been criticized as
gross underestimates, estimates India had a higher GDP per capita in the 18th century, and
Parthasarathi's findings show higher in 18th-century and
. But there is
consensus that India's per capita GDP and income stagnated during the colonial
era, starting in the late 18th century.

Under British rule, India's share of the world economy declined from 24.4% in
1700 down to 4.2% in 1950. India's GDP per capita was stagnant during
the and began to decline
prior to the onset of British rule. India's share of global industrial
output declined from 25% in 1750 down to 2% in 1900. At the same time,
Britain's share of the world economy rose from 2.9% in 1700 up to 9% in 1870.
The British East India Company, following their in 1757, had forced open
the large Indian market to British goods, which could be sold in India without
or "Duty
\"), compared to local Indian producers who were heavily taxed,
while in Britain policies
such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian textiles
from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India without
tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian cotton
and sold them back to the Indian market. British economic policies gave them a
monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. India
served as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers
and a large for
British manufactured goods.

British territorial expansion in India throughout the 19th century created an
institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed among the colonisers,
encouraged , and created a single
currency with , standardised weights and measures and within the company-held
territories. It also established a system of
and
telegraphs, a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference,
a common-law, and an adversarial legal system. This coincided with major
changes in the world economy – industrialisation, and significant growth in
production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an
economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, with
industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing
population, a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely
inadequate infrastructure.

The 1872 census revealed that 91.3% of the population of the region
constituting present-day India resided in villages. This was a decline
from the earlier Mughal era, when 85% of the population resided in villages
and 15% in urban centres under 's reign in
1600. Urbanisation generally remained sluggish in British India until the
1920s, due to the lack of industrialisation and absence of adequate
transportation. Subsequently, the policy of discriminating protection ,
coupled with the Second World War, saw the development and dispersal of
industries, encouraging rural-urban migration, and in particular, the large
port cities of , and grew rapidly. Despite this,
only one-sixth of India's population lived in cities by 1951.

The effect of British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic.
Leaders of the and have
blamed colonial rule for India's poor economic performance following
independence and argued that the capital required for the Industrial
Revolution in Britain came from India. At the same time, other historians have
countered that India's poor economic performance was due to various sectors
being in a state of growth and decline due to changes brought in by
colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialisation and
.

Several economic historians have argued that Indian declined in the early 19th century, or
possibly beginning in the very late 18th century, largely as a result of
British colonial rule. According to Prasannan Parthasarathi and Sashi
Sivramkrishna, the grain wages of Indian weavers were likely comparable to
that of their British counterparts and their average income was around five
times the subsistence level, which was comparable to advanced parts of
Europe. However they concluded that due to the scarcity of data, it
was hard to draw definitive conclusions and that more research was
required. It has also been argued that India went through a period
of deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect
outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire.

The collapse of the , which

regulation.

In response, the government, including Finance Minister , initiated in 1991. The reforms did away with the , reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public

reforming labour laws and reducing . This has

Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted
for 18.4% of the GDP, the sector employed 51.2 crore persons or 45.5% of
the workforce in India are employed in agriculture. India is major
agriculture producing country and has the most arable land in the world
followed by the United States. However, agricultural output lags far
behind its potential. Agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily
declined from 1951 to 2023, shifting from 52% to 15% of India's GDP
yet it is still the country's largest employment provider sector . Crop-
yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown since 1950, due to the special
emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year plans and steady improvements
in irrigation, technology, application of modern agricultural practices and
provision of agricultural credit and subsidies since the Green Revolution in
India. However, international comparisons reveal the average yield in India is
generally 30% to 50% of the highest average yield in the world. The
states of ,
, Haryana, , Andhra Pradesh,
, Bihar, , Gujarat and
are key contributors to Indian
agriculture.

India receives an average annual rainfall of 1,208 millimetres and a
total annual "Precipitation \") of 4,000 billion cubic metres, with the total
utilisable , including surface and , amounting to 1,123 billion cubic metres. 546,820 square
kilometres of the land area, or about 39% of the total
cultivated area, is irrigated. India's inland water resources and marine
resources provide employment to nearly 6 million people in the fisheries
sector. In 2023, according to the Ministry of Fisheries, India is the 3rd
largest fish producing and 2nd largest aquaculture producing nation in the
world.

India exports more
than 100,000 tonnes of processed cashew
kernels every year. There are more than 600 cashew processing units in
alone.

India is the largest producer of milk, jute and , and has the world's largest cattle population with 303 million
animals in 2023. It is the second-largest producer of rice, wheat,
sugarcane, cotton and , as well as the
second-largest fruit and vegetable producer, accounting for 10.9% and 8.6% of
the world fruit and vegetable production, respectively, but only for 1% of
global fruits and vegetables trade. India is also the second-largest producer
and the largest consumer of silk, producing 77,000 tonnes in 2005. India is the second-largest exporter of
cashew kernels and cashew nut shell liquid . Foreign exchange earned by
the country through the export of cashew kernels during FY 2023 reached 356M$.
76,624 tonnes of kernels were exported
during 2023. There are about 600 cashew processing units in
, Kerala.

India's foodgrain production stagnant at approximately 316 megatonnes during 2020–21. India exports
several agriculture products, such as Basmati rice, wheat, cereals, spices,
fresh fruits, dry fruits, cotton, tea, coffee, milk products and other cash
crops to the Asian, African and other countries.

The low productivity in India is a result of several factors. Over-regulation
of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty, and
governmental intervention in labour, land, and credit are hurting the market.
Infrastructure such as rural roads, electricity, ports, food storage, retail
markets and services remain inadequate. The average size of land holdings
is very small, with 70% of holdings being less than one hectare in
size. Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that
only 46% of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of
2016,]resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the
, which is often
inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country. In an effort to
bring an additional 20,000,000 hectares of land under
irrigation, various schemes have been attempted, including the Accelerated
Irrigation Benefit Programme which was provided ₹800 billion
in the . Farming
incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and distribution
infrastructure; a third of India's agricultural production is lost from
spoilage.

### Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises ")]

See also: India began its first few steps during the years 1978-80 when early conditions
for SMEs or entrepreneurship were hostile too. 63 million MSMEs in India which
contribute _35% to the country's GDP_ provides employment to 111.4 million
persons and accounts for more than 40% of India's exports and are hailed as
the 'growth engines' of the economy. China has been creating 16,000-18,000 new
enterprises per day for the last 5 years. When one compares that with India,
it is about 1000-1100 per day.

Micro and small enterprises have the potential to resolve India's unemployment
crisis provided the constraints impeding the growth of the sector are
resolved. According to Annual MSME Report 2021-22, over 90 per cent of India's
6.3 crore MSMEs are in the micro-segment. Within the micro sector, 62 per cent
firms are self-employments which no workers, another 32 per cent have two or
three workers and just 6-7 per cent have four workers or above . In 2023, SME IPOs set a record-breaking year with 179 listings.

In Budget 2023, The government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at
boosting MSMEs' growth in India while also improving their international
competitiveness.

#### Mining

]

Main articles: and
an mine

India has, in 2022, a reported 1,319 mines of which reporting mines for
metallic minerals were estimated at 545 and non-metallic minerals at 775.

Mining contributed to 1.75% of GDP and employed directly or indirectly 11
million people in 2021. India's mining industry was the fourth-largest
producer of minerals in the world by volume, and eighth-largest producer by
value in 2009. In 2013, it mined and processed 89 minerals, of which four
were fuel, three were atomic energy minerals, and 80 non-fuel. The public
sector accounted for 68% of mineral production by volume in 2011–12.
India has the world's fourth-largest ,
with the contributing
11% of the country's industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP.

Nearly 50% of India's mining industry, by output value, is concentrated in
eight states: , Rajasthan,
, Andhra Pradesh,
, Jharkhand, and
. Another 25% of the output by value
comes from offshore oil and gas resources. India operated about 3,000
mines in 2010, half of which were coal, limestone and iron ore. On
output-value basis, India was one of the five largest producers of mica,
chromite, coal, lignite, iron ore, bauxite, barite, zinc and manganese; while
being one of the ten largest global producers of many other
minerals. India was the fourth-largest producer of steel in
2013, and the seventh-largest producer of aluminium.

India's mineral resources are vast. However, its mining industry has
declined – contributing 2.3% of its GDP in 2010 compared to 3% in 2000, and
employed 2.9 million people – a decreasing percentage of its total labour.
India is a net importer of many minerals including coal. India's mining sector
decline is because of complex permit, regulatory and administrative
procedures, inadequate infrastructure, shortage of capital resources, and slow
adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies.

#### Cement

]

Indian cement industry is the 2nd largest cement producing country in the
world, next only to China. At present, the Installed Capacity of Cement in
India is 500 MTPA with production of 298 million tonnes per annum. Majority of
the cement plants installed capacity is located in the states of
south India. In PAT scheme, Total Installed Capacity of Cement in India is 325
MTPA which contributes to 65% coverage of total installed capacity in India.

#### Iron and steel

India surpassed Japan as the second largest steel producer in January
2019. As per worldsteel, India's crude steel production in 2018 was at
106.5 tonnes , 4.9% increase from 101.5
tonnes in 2017, which means that India
overtook Japan as the world's second largest steel production country.

According to data presented by PIB, there are more than 900 steel
plants in India that produce crude steel. These are owned by PSUs, large-scale
companies as well as small and medium enterprises . In the year 2021–22,
the total capacity of these plants stood at 154.06 million tonnes.

The total market value of the Indian steel sector stood at US$57.8 billion in
2011 and is predicted to touch US$95.3 billion by 2016.Growth of crude steel
production in India has not kept pace with the growth in capacity of
production, according to the report. As per this report, steel sector
contributes 2 per cent to India's GDP and employs half a million people
directly and 2 million people indirectly. The Indian steel sector has been
vibrant, growing at a compounded rate of 6% year-on-year. Multiple
integrated steel plants both state-owned and private are using automated AI-
based systems for production.

#### Petroleum

Main article: in Petroleum products and chemicals are a major contributor to India's industrial
GDP, and together they contribute over 34% of its export earnings. India hosts
and petrochemical operations developed with help of
technology such as and , it also includes the
world's largest refinery complex in that
processes 1.24 million barrels of crude per day. By volume, the Indian
chemical industry was the third-largest producer in Asia, and contributed 5%
of the country's GDP. India is one of the five-largest producers of
agrochemicals, polymers and plastics, dyes and various organic and inorganic
chemicals. Despite being a large producer and exporter, India is a net
importer of chemicals due to domestic demands. India's is
extremely diversified and estimated at $178 billion.

#### Chemicals and fertilizer

]

The chemical industry contributed $163 billion to the economy in FY18 and is
expected to reach $300–400 billion by 2025. The industry employed
17.33 million people in 2016.

At present, 57 large fertilizer units are manufacturing a wide number of
nitrogen fertilizers. These include 29 urea-producing units and 9 ammonia
sulfate-producing units as a by-product. Besides, there are 64 small-scale
producing units of single super phosphate.

According to the latest data released by the WTO, India has emerged as the
second largest exporter of agrochemicals in the world. The rank was sixth, 10
years ago. The Indian agrochemical industry fetches valuable trade surplus
every year. The trade surplus sharply increased from Rs. 8,030 crores in
2017–18 to Rs. 28,908 crores in the last fiscal. India's agrochemicals export
has doubled in the last 6 years from $2.6 bn in 2017–18 to $5.4 bn in the last
financial year according to the data recently released by Ministry of
Commerce. It has grown at an impressive CAGR of 13% which is among the highest
in the manufacturing sector.

Millions of farmers in over 130 countries trust Indian agrochemicals for their
high quality and affordable prices, said an industry observer. With the global
agrochemicals market estimated at $78 billion, predominantly comprising post-
patent products, India is rapidly becoming a preferred global hub for sourcing
such agrochemicals. To bolster domestic production and reduce imports, the
Crop Care Federation of India has recommended specific measures to the
Government of India.

in 2009–10. While agriculture employment has fallen over time in percentage of
labour employed, services which include construction and infrastructure have
seen a steady growth accounting for 20.3% of employment in 2012–13. Of
the total workforce, 7% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in
the government-controlled public sector. About 51.2% of the workforce in
India is self-employed. Despite having one of the longest working hours,
India has one of the lowest levels in
the world. According to a 2005–06 survey, there is a
gender gap in employment and salaries. In rural areas, both men and women are
primarily self-employed, mostly in agriculture. In urban areas, salaried work
was the largest source of employment for both men and women in 2006.

### Unemployment

]

Main article: Unemployment in India is characterised by . Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and
unemployment – which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled
people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt to solve the
problem by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing
skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments,
etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the
public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for
focusing on better education and created political pressure for further
reforms. India's labour regulations are heavy, even by developing
country standards, and analysts have urged the government to abolish or modify
them to make the environment more conducive for employment
generation. The "Eleventh Five-Year Plan \") has also identified
the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment generation,
by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances
required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been
identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment
opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.

### Child labour

the government has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child
labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch
programs, creating special investigation cells, etc. Author Sonalde
Desai stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some
pockets of industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively
few Indian children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now
rare. In the 10–14 age group, the latest surveys find only 2% of children
working for wage, while another 9% work within their home or rural farms
assisting their parents in times of high work demand such as sowing and
harvesting of crops.

### Diaspora remittance

India has the largest diaspora around the world, an estimated 32 million
people according to the "Ministry of External
Affairs \"), many of whom work overseas and remit funds back to
their families. The Middle East region is the largest source of employment for
expat Indians. The crude oil production and infrastructure industry of Saudi
Arabia employs over 2 million expat Indians. Cities such as
and in
United Arab Emirates have employed another 2 million Indians during the
construction boom in recent decades. In 2009–10,

migrants overseas stood at 2.5
, the highest in the world, but their share
in FDI remained low at around 1%.

### Poverty

territories

In May 2014, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to its poverty
calculation methodology of 2005 and purchasing-power-parity basis for
measuring poverty. According to the revised methodology, the world had 872.3
million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million lived in
India. With 17.5% of the total world's population, India had a 20.6% share of
the world's poorest in 2013. According to a 2005–2006 survey, India
had about 61 million children under the age of 5 who were chronically
malnourished. A 2011 UNICEF report stated that between 1990 and 2010, India
achieved a 45 percent reduction in mortality rates under the age of 5, and now
ranks 46th of 188 countries on this metric.

Since the early 1960s, successive governments have implemented various schemes
to alleviate poverty, under central planning, that have met with partial
success. In 2005, the government enacted the , guaranteeing 100
days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in all the districts
of India. In 2011, it was widely criticised and beset with controversy
for corrupt officials, deficit financing as the source of funds, poor quality
of infrastructure built under the programme, and unintended destructive
effects. Other studies suggest that the programme has helped
reduce rural poverty in some cases. Yet other studies report that
India's economic growth has been the driver of sustainable employment and
poverty reduction, though a sizeable population remains in poverty.
India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016,
recording the fastest reductions in the multidimensional poverty index values
during the period with strong improvements in areas such as assets, cooking
fuel, sanitation, and nutrition.

On the 2019 India with a score of 30.3, being
categorized as 'serious' in severity. In 2024, India ranked 105 with a score of 27.3, indicating an improvement in its hunger
situation.

According to the ’s Spring ,
approximately 171 million people in India moved out of extreme poverty between
2011 and 2023. During this period, the country's poverty rate declined
significantly from 16.2% to 2.3%, based on the international poverty line of
$2.15 per day.

nationalised in 1949, the RBI serves as the nation's monetary authority,
regulator and supervisor of the monetary system, banker to the government,
custodian of foreign exchange reserves, and as an issuer of currency. It is
governed by a central board of directors, headed by a governor who is
appointed by the Government of India. The benchmark are set by the .

devalued in September 1975 and the system of fixed par rate was replaced with
a basket of four major international currencies: the British pound, US dollar,
the and the . In 1991, after the collapse
of its largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, India faced the major
foreign exchange crisis and the rupee was devalued by around 19% in two stages
on 1 and 2 July. In 1992, a Liberalized Exchange Rate Mechanism was
introduced. Under LERMS, exporters had to surrender 40 percent of their
foreign exchange earnings to the RBI at the RBI-determined exchange rate; the
remaining 60% could be converted at the market-determined exchange rate. In
1994, the rupee was convertible on the current account, with some capital
controls.

After the sharp devaluation in 1991 and transition to current account
convertibility in 1994, the value of the rupee has been largely determined by
market forces. The rupee has been fairly stable during the decade 2000–2010.
In October 2022, rupee touched an all-time low 83.29 to US dollar.

allowed to list their securities internationally without first completing an

concurrently. Further, security laws have been revised to ease overseas
listings of already-listed companies, to increase liquidity for private equity
and international investors in Indian companies.

Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated
from world markets, to protect its economy and to achieve self-reliance.
Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative
restrictions, while was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology
transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were
needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions
ensured that FDI averaged only around $200 million annually between 1985 and
1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid,
commercial borrowing and deposits of . India's exports were stagnant for the first 15 years
after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government
of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation,
consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.
Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade has increased
sharply, with the contribution of total trade in goods and services to
the GDP rising from 16% in 1990–91 to 47% in 2009–10. Foreign trade
accounted for 48.8% of India's GDP in 2015. Globally, India accounts for
1.44% of exports and 2.12% of imports for merchandise trade and 3.34% of
exports and 3.31% of imports for commercial services trade. India's major
trading partners are the European Union, China, United States and . In 2006–07,
major export commodities included engineering goods, petroleum products,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, textiles and garments,
agricultural products, iron ore and other minerals. Major import commodities
included crude oil and related products, machinery, electronic goods, gold and
silver. In November 2010, exports increased 22.3% year-on-year to ₹851
billion , while imports
were up 7.5% at ₹1.25 trillion . The trade deficit for the same month dropped from ₹469 billion
in 2009 to ₹401 billion
in 2010.

### Balance of payments

current account balance 1980–2008 based on IMF data

Since independence, India's on its "Current account
\") has been negative. Since economic liberalisation in
the 1990s, precipitated by a balance-of-payment crisis, India's exports rose
consistently, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in
1990–91. However, the global economic slump followed by a general
deceleration in world trade saw the exports as a percentage of imports drop to
61.4% in 2008–09. India's growing oil import bill is seen as the main
driver behind the large current account deficit, which rose to $118.7
billion, or 11.11% of GDP, in 2008–09. Between January and October 2010,
India imported $82.1 billion worth of crude oil. The Indian economy has
run a trade deficit every year from 2002 to 2012, with a merchandise trade
deficit of US$189 billion in 2011–12. Its trade with China has the
largest deficit, about $31 billion in 2013.

India's reliance on external assistance and concessional debt has decreased
since liberalisation of the economy, and the decreased from 35.3% in
1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, "External commercial
borrowing \") , or commercial loans from non-resident lenders,
are being permitted by the government for providing an additional source of
funds to Indian corporates. The monitors

India under the of 1999. India's have
steadily risen from $5.8 billion in March 1991 to ₹38,832.21 billion in July 2020. In 2012, United Kingdom announced an end to
all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian
economy.

India's current account deficit reached an all-time high in 2013. India
has historically funded its current account deficit through borrowings by
companies in the overseas markets or remittances by non-resident Indians and
portfolio inflows. From April 2016 to January 2017, RBI data showed that, for
the first time since 1991, India was funding its deficit through foreign
direct investment inflows. __ noted that the development was "a sign of rising confidence
among long-term investors in Prime Minister 's ability to strengthen the
country's economic foundation for sustained growth".

As the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India has attracted
. During the year 2011, FDI inflow into India stood at
$36.5 billion, 51.1% higher than the 2010 figure of $24.15 billion. India has
strengths in telecommunication, information technology and other significant
areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals, and
jewellery. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid FDI policies
were a significant hindrance. Over time, India has adopted a number of FDI
reforms. India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical
expertise. The size of the population stands at 300 million and represents
a growing consumer market.

India liberalised its FDI policy in 2005, allowing up to a 100% FDI stake in
ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial
licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy
access to foreign technology and investment. The upward growth curve of the
real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI
regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in
the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction
development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals,
educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-
level infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms
to defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.

From 2000 to 2010, the country attracted $178 billion as FDI. The
inordinately high investment from is

tax advantages – double taxation is avoided due to a between India and Mauritius, and Mauritius is a capital

taxation FDI channel. FDI accounted for 2.1% of India's GDP in 2015.

As the government has eased 87 foreign investment direct rules across 21
sectors in the last three years, FDI inflows hit $60.1 billion between 2016
and 2017 in India.

#### Outflows

Since 2000, Indian companies have expanded overseas, investing FDI and
creating jobs outside India. From 2006 to 2010, FDI by Indian companies
outside India amounted to 1.34 per cent of its GDP. Indian companies have
deployed FDI and started operations in United States, Europe and
Africa. The Indian conglomerate is United Kingdom's largest manufacturer and private-sector
employer.

Corruption has been a pervasive problem in India. A 2005 study by
found that more than half of those surveyed had first-
hand experience of paying a bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a
public office in the previous year. A follow-up study in 2008 found this
rate to be 40 percent. In 2011, TI ranked India at 95th place amongst 183
countries in perceived levels of public sector corruption. By 2016, India
saw a reduction in corruption, and its ranking improved to 79th place.

In 1996, , bureaucracy, and the were suggested as a cause for
institutionalised corruption and inefficiency. More recent
reports suggest the causes of corruption include excessive
regulations and approval requirements, mandated spending programs, monopoly of
certain goods and service providers by government-controlled institutions,
bureaucracy with discretionary powers, and lack of transparent laws and
processes.

Computerisation of services, various central and state vigilance commissions,
and the 2005 – which requires government officials to furnish
information requested by citizens or face punitive action – have considerably
reduced corruption and opened avenues to redress grievances.

In 2011, the Indian government concluded that most spending fails to reach its
intended recipients, as the large and inefficient bureaucracy consumes
budgets. India's absence rates are among the worst in the world; one
study found that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of government-owned
public-sector medical workers could not be found at the workplace.
Similarly, many issues are facing Indian scientists, with demands for
transparency, a system, and
an overhaul of the bureaucratic agencies that oversee science and
technology.

India has an , with a 2006 report alleging that India topped the worldwide list
for with almost
$1,456 billion stashed in Swiss banks. This would amount to 13 times the
country's total external debt. These allegations have been denied by
the . James Nason, the Head of International Communications for the
Swiss Banking Association, suggested "The figures were rapidly
picked up in the Indian media and in Indian opposition circles, and circulated
as gospel truth. However, this story was a complete fabrication. The Swiss
Bankers Association never published such a report. Anyone claiming to have
such figures should be forced to identify their source and explain
the methodology used to produce them." A Step was taken by Prime
Minister Modi, on 8 November 2016, involved the demonetization of all 500 and
1000 rupee bank notes to return
black money into the economy followed by criticism that the measure was deemed
ineffective by economists and negatively affected the poorest people of India.

India has made progress in increasing the primary education attendance rate
and expanding to
approximately three-fourths of the population. India's literacy rate had
grown from 52.2% in 1991 to 74.04% in 2011. The right to education at the
elementary level has been made one of the fundamental rights under the Eighty-
Sixth Amendment of 2002, and legislation has been enacted to further the
objective of providing free education to all children. However, the
literacy rate of 74% is lower than the worldwide average, and the country
suffers from a high drop-out rate. Literacy rates and educational
opportunities vary by region, gender, urban and rural areas, and among
different social groups.

A critical problem facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional
variations among India's different states and territories in terms of poverty,
availability of infrastructure, and socio-economic development. Six low-
income states – , Chhattisgarh,
, Madhya Pradesh, , and – are home
to more than one-third of India's population. Severe disparities exist
among states in terms of income, literacy rates, life expectancy, and living
conditions. The four states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and
Karnataka alone are projected to account for almost 50% of India's GDP by
2030; the five are
projected to contribute 35% of India's GDP by 2030 despite currently having
20% of India's population.

The five-year plans, especially in the pre-liberalisation era, attempted to
reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the
interior regions and distributing industries across states. The results have
been discouraging as these measures increased inefficiency and hampered
effective industrial growth. The more advanced states have been better
placed to benefit from liberalisation, with well-developed infrastructure and
an educated and skilled workforce, which attract the manufacturing and service
sectors. Governments of less-advanced states have tried to reduce disparities
by offering tax holidays and cheap land and focused on sectors like tourism,
which can develop faster than other sectors. India's income is 33.9, according to
the United Nations Development Programme , indicating overall income
distribution to be more uniform than East Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
The _Global Wealth Migration Review_ _2019_ report, published by New World
Wealth, estimated that 48% of India's total wealth was held by high-net-worth
individuals. According to a 2021 report by the , India has roughly
1.2 billion lower-income individuals, 66 million middle-income individuals, 16
million upper-middle-income individuals, and 2 million in the high-income
group. As per __ , 78
million of India's population are considered middle class as of 2017, if
defined using the cutoff of those making more than $10 per day, a standard
used by the India's .

There is a continuing debate on whether India's economic expansion has been
pro-poor or anti-poor. Studies suggest that urban economic growth has
become less pro-poor since the .

### Climate change

]

Several banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC
Bank have taken the lead in funding green projects even as the Reserve Bank of
India comes up with norms for lenders to disclose their actions on climate
risk. RBI in an earlier report in 2022, had said that climate change would
require "intensive capital mobilisation" for that India needs $17.77
trillion.

The RBI recommends that regulated entities rely upon the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework, the most prominent
climate disclosure framework globally, at least at the initial stage.

India is home to 75 per cent of the world's wild tiger population. The big
cats like lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, snow leopard, jaguar and puma were on
the brink of extinction. With hunting and encroachment, their numbers dropped
to a mere 20. Efforts to save the lion started before Independence but it was
in 1965 that the Indian Forest Service stepped in to set up a conservation
programme. Researchers believe a combination of factors is driving the
unprecedented migration in tigers. Rising temperatures due to climate change
are making the lower foothills less hospitable.
