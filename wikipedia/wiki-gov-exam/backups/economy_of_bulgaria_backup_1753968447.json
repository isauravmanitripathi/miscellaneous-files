    "text": "The **economy of Bulgaria** functions on the principles of the free market,\nhaving a large private sector and a smaller public one. Bulgaria is a\ndeveloping, industrialised, mid-income country according to the World Bank,\nand is a member of the European Union (EU), the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the\nOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). The Bulgarian\neconomy has experienced significant growth (538%), starting from $13.15\nbillion (nominal, 2000) and reaching estimated gross domestic product (GDP) of\n$107 billion (nominal, 2024 est.) or $229 billion (PPP, 2024 est.), GDP per\ncapita of $36,000 (PPP, 2024 est.), average gross monthly salary of 2,468 leva\n(1,262 euro) (December 2024), and average net monthly salary of $2,191\n(adjusted for living costs in PPP) (Q2 2024).[_circular reference_] The\nnational currency is the lev (plural leva), pegged to the euro at 1.95583 leva\nfor 1 euro. The lev is the strongest and most stable currency in Eastern\nEurope.\n\nVideo summary (script)\n\nThe strongest sectors in the economy are energy, mining, metallurgy, machine\nbuilding, agriculture and tourism. Primary industrial exports are clothing,\niron and steel, machinery and refined fuels.\n\nSofia is the capital and economic heart of Bulgaria and home to most major\nBulgarian and international companies operating in the country, as well as the\nBulgarian National Bank and the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. Plovdiv is the\nsecond-largest city and has one of the largest economies, richest and happiest\npeople in Bulgaria. Varna is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the\nlargest city on the Black Sea in Bulgaria.\n\nThe Bulgarian economy has developed significantly in the last 26 years,\ndespite all difficulties after the disband of Comecon in 1991. In the early\n1990s, the country's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax\nand investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept the foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) among the lowest in the region. Total FDI from 1991 through\n1996 was $831 million.\n\nIn December 1996, Bulgaria joined the World Trade Organization. In the years\nsince 1997, Bulgaria begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004\nalone, over 2.72 billion euro ($3.47 billion) were invested by foreign\ncompanies. In 2005, economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euro\n($2.3 billion) in the FDI, which is attributed mainly to the end of the\nprivatization of the major state-owned companies.\n\nAfter joining the European Union in 2007, Bulgaria registered a peak in\nforeign investment of about 6 bln euro. Low productivity and competitiveness\non the European and world markets alike due to inadequate R&D funding,\nhowever, still remain a significant obstacle for foreign investment.\nNevertheless, according to the latest Annual report of the Economic Research\nInstitute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the average salary in Bulgaria\nis a quarter (1/4) of the average salary in the European Union, and should be\ntwo times higher when the labour productivity is calculated in the formula.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, Bulgaria saw its economy decline by 5.5% in 2009,\nbut quickly restored positive growth levels to 0.2% in 2010, in contrast to\nother Balkan countries. However, the growth continued to be weak in the\nfollowing years, and GDP only reached pre-crisis levels in 2014.",

    "text": "During the Socialism era, Bulgarian economy continued to be industrialized,\nalthough free market trade substantially decreased, as private market\ninitiatives became state-regulated. Still, the Bulgarian economy made\nsignificant overall progress in modernizing road infrastructure, airline\ntransportation, as well as developing the tourism sector by building tourist\nresorts along the Black Sea coast and the mountain regions.\n\nFrom the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in Eastern\nEurope in November 1989, the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) exerted complete\neconomic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The party's ascent to\npower in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards planned\neconomy. During that time, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic\ndevelopment more closely than any other member of the Eastern Bloc, while\nbecoming one of the first members of Comecon. The new regime shifted the\neconomy type from a predominantly agrarian one towards an industrial economy,\nwhile encouraging the relocation of the labour force from the countryside to\nthe cities, thus providing workers for the newly built large-scale industrial\ncomplexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade\nshifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and the USSR.\n\nThese new policies resulted in impressive initial rates of economic\ndevelopment. Bulgarian economy closely resembled that of the Soviet Union.\nSoviet-style centralised planning formed by consecutive five-year plan periods\nhad more immediate benefits there compared to the other Eastern European\nstates where it was first applied in the early 1950s. Throughout the postwar\nperiod, economic progress was also substantially assisted by a level of\ninternal political stability unseen in other Eastern European countries during\nthe same period. That represented a change on the Bulgarian political scene,\nas political turbulence was common before BCP's ascent to power.\n\nNonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s, low capital and labour\nproductivity, as well as expensive material inputs, plagued the Bulgarian\neconomy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic\nexperimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic\nframework, although never approaching a market-based economy.\n\nIn the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance intensified economic\nhardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic\npolicies had become quite clear. Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically\nafter 1987, shortly before Comecon, with which the Bulgarian economy had\nintegrated closely, dissolved in 1991. On 10 November 1989, at the November\nplenum of BCP, Todor Zhivkov was dismissed from his long-held party leader and\nhead of state positions. The communist regime gave way to democratic elections\nand government. Unlike the communist parties in most other Eastern European\nstates, the BCP (changing its name to Bulgarian Socialist Party) retained\npower by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made\npossible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power\nbase and other moves which permitted economic re-orientation toward a market\nsystem. This difficult transition combined with political vagueness and\nunpreparedness of the Bulgarian people for social and economic changes led to\ndramatically worsening economic conditions during the early 1990s.",

Also, as a result of\npolitical unrest with the first attempts to re-establish a democratic\npolitical system and free market economy the standard of living fell by about\n40%, and only started to stabilize significantly after 1998 after the fall of\nJean Videnov's socialist government.

Inflation, which surged to 122% in 1994,\nfell to normal rates of 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy\ncollapsed during Jean Videnov's government. That was due to the Bulgarian\nSocialist Party's inability to introduce vital economic reforms and failure to\nset legislative standards for banking and financial institutions, thus forcing\nan unstable banking system. All this led to an inflation rate of 311%, and the\ncollapse of the lev. In the spring 1997, the pro-reform United Democratic\nForces coalition came to power with its ambitious economic reform package. The\nreforms included introduction of a currency board regime, which was agreed to\nwith the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and allowed the\neconomy to stabilize.

Corruption in the public administration and\na weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, with presence of\norganized crime remaining very high.\n\nAlthough politicians were giving warranties that the late-2000s recession\nwould not hit Bulgaria, the economy suffered a 5.5% GDP decline in that\nperiod. Unemployment rose for at least five-quarters bringing Bulgaria's worst\nrecession since the early 1990s. Still, economic circumstances were not too\nsevere when compared to the rest of Europe.

    "text": "On 1 January 2007, Bulgaria entered the European Union. This led to some\nimmediate international trade liberalization, but there was no shock to the\neconomy. The government ran annual surpluses of above 3%.[_when?_] This fact,\ntogether with annual GDP growth of above 5%, has brought the government\nindebtedness to 22.8% of GDP in 2006 from 67.3% five years earlier. This is to\nbe contrasted with enormous current account deficits. Low interest rates\nguaranteed availability of funds for investment and consumption. For example,\na boom in the real estate market started around 2003. At the same time annual\ninflation in the economy was variable and during the last five years\n(2003–2007) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.3%. Most importantly, this\nposes a threat to the country's accession to the Eurozone. The Bulgarian\ngovernment originally planned to adopt the Euro no sooner than 2015. Although\nBulgaria will have to adopt the euro as a condition to membership, plans have\nsince been postponed for better economic times. From a political point of\nview, there is a trade-off between Bulgaria's economic growth and the\nstability required for early accession to the monetary union. Bulgaria's per-\ncapita PPP GDP is about 70% of the EU27 average (2025), while the country's\nnominal GDP per capita is about 43% of the EU27 average (2021). However,\nBulgaria ranks 38th (2015) in the Ease of Doing Business rank list, higher\nthan most other Eastern European states, and 40th (2012) in the Economic\nFreedom of the World index, outperforming Belgium, Spain, Poland, Hungary,\nPortugal. Bulgaria also has the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates\nin the EU, as well as the second lowest public debt of all European Union\nmember states at 16.2% of GDP in 2010.",

After\nshowing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgaria's\nindustrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The\nperformance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however.\nFood processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet\nmarkets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western\nEurope. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s,\nalthough clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.\n\nOil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export\nmarket and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant\nLUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition, but is\nsubject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which\nis dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex\nprivatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous\nmetallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought\nby Union Minière of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.\n\nThe end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were\ngrave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industry's plan\nfor survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and\ndoing cooperative manufacturing with Russian companies. The electronics\nindustry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has\nnot been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now\nrelies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign\ninvestment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars,\ntrucks, and buses. The manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist\nera, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the\nmajor Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and\nprivatization (Varna).\n\nOnly in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has\nregained higher levels. The largest centres include Sofia, Plovdiv and the\nsurrounding area, Botevgrad, Stara Zagora, Varna, Pravets and many other\ncities. Household appliances, computers, CDs, telephones, medical and\nscientific equipment are being produced. In 2008, the electronics industry\nshipped more than $260 million in exports, primarily of components, computers\nand consumer electronics.\n\nMany factories producing transportation equipment currently[update] still do\nnot operate at full capacity. Plants produce trains (Burgas, Dryanovo), trams\n(Sofia), trolleys (Dupnitsa), buses (Botevgrad), trucks (Shumen), motor trucks\n(Plovdiv, Lom, Sofia, Lovech). Lovech has an automotive assembly plant. Rousse\nserves as the main centre for agricultural machinery. Bulgarian arms\nproduction mainly operates in central Bulgaria (Kazanlak, Sopot, Karlovo).\n\nConstruction output fell dramatically in the 1990s as industrial and housing\nconstruction declined, but a recovery began in the early 2000s. The sector,\nnow dominated by private firms, has resumed the foreign building programs that\nled to prosperity in the communist era. The Glavbolgarstroy firm has major\nbuilding projects in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine as well as domestic\ncontracts.\n\nOne of the biggest Romanian investments in Bulgaria is in the\nconstruction/retail industry, namely the Budmax brand of construction supply\nstores (owned by Arabesque).",

    "text": "AES Galabovo, part of Maritza Iztok Complex\n\nBulgaria relies on imported oil and natural gas (most of which comes from\nRussia), together with domestic generation of electricity from coal-powered\nand hydro plants, and the Kozloduy nuclear plant. Bulgaria imports 97% of its\nnatural gas from Russia. The economy remains energy-intensive because\nconservation practices have developed slowly. The country is a major regional\nelectricity producer. Bulgaria produced 38.07 billion kWh of electricity in\n2006 (in comparison, Romania, which has a population nearly three times larger\nthan Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kW·h in the same year). The domestic\npower-generating industry, which was privatized in 2004 by sales to interests\nfrom Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States, suffers from obsolete\nequipment and a weak oversight agency. To solve the latter problem, in 2008\nthe government set up a state-owned energy holding-company (Bulgarian Energy\nHolding EAD), composed of gas company Bulgargaz, Bulgartransgaz, power company\nNEK EAD, Electricity System Operator EAD, Kozloduy nuclear power station,\nMaritza-Iztok II thermal power station, the Mini Maritza Iztok (Maritza Iztok\nmines), and Bulgartel EAD. The state holds a 100% stake in the holding\ncompany. Most of Bulgaria's conventional power stations will require large-\nscale modernization in the near future. Bulgaria has some 64 small\nhydroelectric plants, which together produce 19 percent of the country's power\noutput.\n\nThe Kozloduy nuclear plant, which in 2005 supplied more than 40 percent of\nBulgaria's electric power, will play a diminishing role because two of its\nremaining four reactors (two were closed in 2002) must be closed by 2007 to\ncomply with European Union (EU) standards. Kozloduy, which exported 14 percent\nof its output in 2006, was expected to cease all exportation in 2007.\nConstruction of the long-delayed Belene nuclear plant resumed in 2006,\nalthough the project was canceled in 2012. Despite that, there were attempts\nto restart the project. Belene, planned in the 1980s but then rejected, was\nrevived by the safety controversy at Kozloduy.\n\nOil exploration is ongoing offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) and on\nthe Romanian border, but Bulgaria's chief oil income is likely to come as a\ntransfer point on east–west and north–south transit lines. Burgas is\nBulgaria's main oil port on the Black Sea. Bulgaria's largest oil refinery,\nNeftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent\nmodernization in 2005. Bulgaria's only significant coal resource is low-\nquality lignite, mainly from the state-owned Maritsa-Iztok and Bobov Dol\ncomplexes and used in local thermoelectric power stations.\n\nThermal power stations (TPPs) provide a significant amount of energy, with\nmost of the capacity concentrated in the Maritsa Iztok Complex. The largest\nTPPs include:\n\n* \"Maritsa Iztok 2\" - **1,450 MW**\n* \"Varna\" - **1,260 MW**\n* \"Maritsa Iztok 3\" - 870 MW\n* \"Bobov Dol\" - 630 MW\n* \"Ruse Iztok\" - 600 MW\n* \"Maritsa Iztok 1/ TETS Galabovo\" - 650 MW\n\nA$1.4 bln. project for the construction of an additional 670 MW block for the\n500 MW Maritza Iztok 1 Thermal Power Station was completed on 3 June 2011.\n\nBulgaria ranks as a minor oil producer (97th in the world) with a total\nproduction of 3,520 bbl/day. Prospectors discovered Bulgaria's first oil field\nnear Tyulenovo in 1951. Proved reserves amount to 15,000,000 bbl (2,400,000\nm3). Natural gas production halted in the late 1990s. Proved reserves of\nnatural gas amount to 5.663 bln. cu m. The LUKOIL Neftochim oil refinery is\nBulgaria's largest refining facility with annual revenues amounting to more\nthan 4 billion leva (2 billion euro).\n\nRecent years[update] have seen a steady increase in electricity production\nfrom renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. Wind energy has\nlarge-scale prospects, with up to 3,400 MW of installed capacity potential. As\nof 2009[update] Bulgaria operates more than 70 wind turbines with a total\ncapacity of 112.6 MW, and plans to increase their number nearly threefold to\nreach a total capacity of 300 MW in 2010.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2017, the import of waste for energy production increased for\nalmost five times. Since 2014, the European Commission financed the\ninstallation of a plant for cogeneration of heat and electricity from refuse-\nderived fuel to be located in Sofia. In 2017, the Bulgaria's Ministry of\nEnvironment and Waters reported to the Basel convention that Bulgaria had\nimported \"69,683 tonnes of waste for incineration in a form of RDF, SRF,\npretreated mixed waste and mixed contaminated plastics.\" As of March 2021, the\ntotal amount of tons of waste annually imported is substantially unknown.",

    "text": "Although the contribution of services to gross domestic product (GDP) has more\nthan doubled in the post-communist era, a substantial share of that growth has\nbeen in government services, and the qualitative level of services varies\ngreatly. The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-\ncommunist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger\noversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In\n2003, the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation\nbegan making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew\nsubstantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public\nconfidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation,\nloan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The\ninsurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the\nhelp of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a\npension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI\nHolding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n(EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded\nthe private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s\nenabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005,\nstock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth\nrate increased beginning in 2004.\n\nAfter a decline in the 1990s, in the 21st century the tourism industry has\ngrown rapidly. In 2016 some 10 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, up from 4\nmillion in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of\nattractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the\nindustry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation\nfacilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgaria's\nretail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of\nWestern-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center.\nBy 2006, several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others\nplanned to enter the Bulgarian market.\n\nBulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property\neither for their own use or for investment. In 2006, more than 29% of property\ndeals were signed by foreigners, more than half of whom were British citizens.\nVarious companies, such as Bulgarian Dreams, actively marketed Bulgarian\nproperties to buyers overseas.\n\nIn 2007 Bulgaria was visited by 5,200,000 tourists, ranking 39th in the\nworld.[_circular reference_] Tourists from Greece, Romania and Germany account\nfor 40% of visitors. Significant numbers of British (+300,000), Russian\n(+200,000), Serbian (+150,000), Polish (+130,000) and Danish (+100,000)\ntourists also visit Bulgaria. Most of them are attracted by the varying and\nbeautiful landscapes, well-preserved historical and cultural heritage, and the\ntranquility of rural and mountain areas.\n\nIn Easter of 2018 it was reported that around 90% of tourists in Varna, one of\nBulgaria's largest tourism locations, came from Romania.\n\nMain destinations include the capital Sofia, coastal resorts Sunny Beach,\nAlbena, Sozopol, Sveti Vlas; winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo, Chepelare and\nBorovetz. Arbanasi and Bozhentsi are rural tourist destinations with well-\npreserved ethnographic traditions.

    "text": "In the communist era, Bulgaria's agriculture was heavily centralized,\nintegrated with agriculture-related industries, and state-run. In the\npostcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private\nowners has been in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank\ninvestment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development\nin the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of\nBulgaria's agricultural sector was private, including a number of large\nprivate cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced\nfor direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important\nsupport for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited\nagricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgaria's\nmain field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are\nsugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the\nmost important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgaria's\nlargest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export\nof wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are\ncattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are\nyogurt, cow and sheep cheese. Bulgaria is the world's 13th largest sheep milk\nproducer and is the 15th largest producer of tobacco and 13th largest producer\nof raspberries in Europe. Specialized equipment amounts to some 25,000\ntractors and 5,500 combine harvesters, with a fleet of light aircraft.\n\nCombine harvester near Slivnitsa. About 43% of Bulgaria's land is arable.\n\nIn 2004, an estimated one-third of Bulgaria's land mass was covered by\nforests, of which about 40 percent was conifers. Between 1980 and 2000, the\nforested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of\ntimber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent,\npulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an\nestimated 45 percent of Bulgaria's timber harvest was logged illegally because\nof corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected\nfrom all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial\nuse. In 2005, about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated\neconomically viable.\n\nSince Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported\nincreasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon)\nhas expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the\nBlack Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase\nthe take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased\nsharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic\nmarkets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgaria's total fish harvest, wild\nand cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the\nharvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.\n\nProduction of the most important crops (according to the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization) in 2006 (in '000 tons) amounted to: wheat 3301.9; sunflower\n1196.6; maize 1587.8; grapes 266.2; tobacco 42.0; tomatoes 213.0; barley\n546.3; potatoes 386.1; peppers 156.7; cucumbers 61.5; cherries 18.2;\nwatermelons 136.0; cabbage 72.7; apples 26.1; plums 18.0; strawberries 8.8.",

    "text": "Bulgaria's mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many\ndeposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment\nand low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged\nless than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the\nfollowing estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron\nore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238\nmillion tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of\nBulgaria's minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done\nby open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not\nsufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc\ndeposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has\nexploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and\ngold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in\nsignificant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope\nMountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.\n\nDespite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased\nin recent years. Mining remains one of the most important sources of export\nearnings and is still a significant contributor to economic growth. The mining\nindustry is worth $760 mln, and, along with related industries, employs\n120,000 people. The rising global prices of gold, lead and copper in 2010, as\nwell as investments in zinc and coal production, have boosted economic growth\nin the mining sector after the Great Recession. As of 2010, Bulgaria ranks as\nthe 19th largest coal producer in the world,[_circular reference_] 9th largest\nbismuth producer,[_circular reference_] 19th largest copper\nproducer,[_circular reference_] and the 26th largest zinc producer.[_circular\nreference_] In Europe, the country ranks fourth in gold production and sixth\nin coal production.\n\nThe \"Elatsite\" copper mine and reprocessing facility, built during Vulko\nChervenkov's rule, takes its place as one of the largest in South-Eastern\nEurope. It extracts 13 million tonnes of ore annually, producing about 42,000\ntonnes of copper, 1.6 tonnes of gold and 5.5 tonnes of silver.\n\nFerrous metallurgy has major importance. Much of the production of steel and\npig iron takes place in Kremikovtsi and Stomana steel in Pernik, with a third\nmetallurgical base in Debelt. In production of steel and steel products per\ncapita the country heads the Balkans. As of 2009[update] the fate of\nKremikovtsi steel factories has come under debate because of serious pollution\nin the capital, Sofia.\n\nThe largest refineries for lead and zinc operate in Plovdiv, Kardzhali and\nNovi Iskar; for copper in Pirdop and Eliseina (now defunct); for aluminium in\nShumen.

Bulgaria has one of the\nlowest rates of Debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nAs of 1 January 2008 the income tax for all citizens is set to a flat rate of\n10%. This flat tax is one of the lowest income rates in the world and the\nlowest income rate in the European Union. The reform was done in pursue for\nhigher GDP growth and greater tax collection rates. Some called it a\n\"revolution\" in taxation, but the changes were met with mild discussions and\nsome protests by affected working classes. The proposal was modified to allow\nfor compensating the perceived losers from the changes in the tax formula. The\ncorporate income tax is also 10% as of 1 January 2007 which is also among the\nlowest in Europe. Currently, this taxation is kept while other countries\nraised their taxes during the crisis. However, most of the state revenues come\nfrom VAT and excises, but share of income and corporate taxes in the revenues\nis increasing.\n\nFor 2005 Bulgaria's estimated state revenues totaled US$11.2 billion, and its\nestimated state expenditures, including capital expenditures, were US$10.9\nbillion, yielding a surplus of US$300 million. In 2004 revenues totaled\nUS$10.1 billion and expenditures US$9.7 billion, for a surplus of US$400\nmillion.\n\nAfter the political changes, in 1991, Bulgaria had a US$11.25 billion state\ndebt, which represented 180% of the GDP. The state debt peaked in 1994, when\nit reached US$14.4 billion. During 1998-2008 Bulgaria maintained policy of\nbudget surpluses, which reduced the state debt to 5.07 billion euro. Combined\nwith the economic growth in that period, the state debt dropped to a record\nlow of 13.7% of GDP, one of the lowest in the European Union. In 2008 Bulgaria\nalso maintained 4.286 billion euro fiscal reserve, meaning that net state debt\nat this moment was only 0.784 billion euro. After the Great Recession Bulgaria\nturned to policy of deficit spending and at the end of 2013 the state debt\nrose up to 7.219 billion euro, representing 18.1% of the GDP. In 2015, the\ndebt rate increased further to 26.7% of the GDP, still remaining the third\nlowest in EU after Estonia and Luxembourg.

    "text": "In the 1990s, Bulgaria moved gradually away from dependence on markets in the\nformer Soviet sphere, increasing its exports to the European Union (EU). In\n1999, Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with\nwhose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania,\nSlovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established\nimportant trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the\nEU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004, some 54\npercent of Bulgaria's import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with\nEU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with\nAlbania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and\nTurkey.\n\nIn the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although\nbeginning in the late 1990s those commodities' share of total imports\ndecreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During\nthat period, the diversification of imported products improved as the volume\nof machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A\nlarge percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth,\nmetal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most\nimportant imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores,\nchemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in\norder of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005,\nBulgaria's largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany,\nTurkey, Greece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were\nclothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In\n2005, Bulgaria's exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled\nUS$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade\ndeficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods\nhave shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.\n\nIn the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3\nbillion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005,\nwhich was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign\ndirect investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance\nwas US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006, the overall balance of payments was US$883\nmillion, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.\n\nBulgaria's large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the\npostcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of\nUS$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross\ndomestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage\nof GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has\ncontributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 1996–97, but\nthe rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of\nEastern Europe. In 2003, the largest national sources of foreign direct\ninvestment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the\nNetherlands. In 1997, the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine,\nand in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas.\nUnion Minière, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-\nsmelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy.\nA number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and\nfood-processing industries in the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian\nelectronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for the\nmanufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract\nto update Bulgaria's military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The\nFrench Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of\nmachinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004,\nBulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh.\nRussia's natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgaria's\nnatural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product.\nA three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic\nOvergas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas\ndistribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted\nbids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is\nthe Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the Maritsa–Iztok–3\nthermal power plant. In 2006 Russia's Gazprom company bid against several\nEuropean energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating\nutilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in\na new oil refinery at Silistra.\n\nIn December 1996, Bulgaria joined the World Trade Organization. In the early\n1990s Bulgaria's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and\ninvestment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among\nthe lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through\n1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to\nattract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone, over 2.72 billion Euro\n(3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005,\neconomists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US\ndollars) in FDI which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of\nthe major state-owned companies. After joining the EU in 2007, Bulgaria\nregistered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 billion euros.",
