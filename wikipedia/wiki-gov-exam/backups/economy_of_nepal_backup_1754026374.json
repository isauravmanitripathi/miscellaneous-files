    "text": "The **economy of Nepal** is a developing category and is largely dependent on\nagriculture and remittances. Until the mid-20th century Nepal was an isolated\npre-industrial society, which entered the modern era in 1951 without schools,\nhospitals, roads, telecommunications, electric power, industry, or civil\nservice. The country has, however, made progress toward sustainable economic\ngrowth since the 1950s. The country was opened to economic liberalization,\nleading to economic growth and improvement in living standards when compared\nto the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher\neconomic development are the frequent changes in political leadership, as well\nas corruption.\n\nNepal has used a series of five-year plans in an attempt to make progress in\neconomic development. It completed its ninth economic development plan in\n2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have\nbeen privatised. Foreign aid to Nepal accounts for more than half of the\ndevelopment budget. Government priorities over the years have been result in\nthe development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture,\nand industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural\ndevelopment efforts have been emphasised. The economy is heavily dependent on\nimports of basic materials and on foreign markets for its forest and\nagricultural products. Nepal possesses immense potential for sustainable\nenergy resources that can be harnessed for energy security, economic growth,\nand environmental sustainability.\n\nAgriculture remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65%\nof the population and providing 31.7% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area\nis cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland\nand forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples,\npears, tomatoes, various salad greens, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as\nrice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an\nagricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.\n\nGDP is heavily dependent on remittances (9.1%) of foreign workers.\nSubsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in\nNepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system\nis under development, and Tribhuvan University has several campuses under it .\nAlthough eradication efforts continue, malaria had been controlled in the\nfertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. Kathmandu is\nlinked to India and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway\nnetwork. The capital was almost out of fuel and supplies, due to a crippling\ngeneral strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.\n\nMajor towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air\nservices. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries like pasmina have\ngrown rapidly in recent years. Together, they account for approximately 70% of\nthe country's merchandise exports. The Cost of Living Index in Nepal is\ncomparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life\nhas declined to a much less desirous value in recent years. In the 2021 Global\nHunger Index, Nepal ranks 76th out of the 116 countries with sufficient data\nto calculate 2021 GHI scores. With a score of 19.1, Nepal has a level of\nhunger that is moderate. Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia.\nWorld Economics estimates Nepal's 2024 GDP at $243 billion in PPP terms\n(Purchasing Power Parity) and an initial estimate of $255 billion for 2025.\nThis figure is 65% higher than the official estimate published by the World\nBank.",

In the fiscal year 2000–2001,\nexports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the\ntrade deficit down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the\nEuropean Union has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and\nvegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine,\npotatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of\nthe country's garment exports.\n\nThe annual monsoon rain strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to\n1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in\n1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.\n\nStrong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid\nhave helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international\nreserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the\nUnited Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Germany, and the Nordic countries.\n\nSeveral multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian\nDevelopment Bank, and the UN Development Programme also provide assistance.

Tourism plays a vital\nrole in Nepal's economy.\n\nProgress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, tourism, and\nhydroelectricity. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks,\nincluding Mount Everest at 8,848.86 m. In the early 1990s, one large public\nsector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been\ncompleted. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects\ncurrently in operation are the Khimti Khola (60 MW) and the Bhote Koshi\nProject (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China,\nIndia and Japan to take the further steps.\n\nUpper Tamakoshi hydropower, biggest hydropower in Nepal. Kulekhani dam also\nknown as \"Indra sarobar\"or \"Kulekhani Reservoir\" combinely producing 106 MW,\nin Makwanpur, Nepal Middle Marsyangdi Hydropower Station, producing 70 MW.\nNepal has significant potential to generate hydropower, which it plans to\nexport across South Asia.\n\nNepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially\nviable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at\npresent, is 2500 MW and increasing.\n\nThe environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat)\nNew year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are\n\"run-of-the-river\" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The\nlargest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the West Seti Dam (750 MW)\nstorage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector.\nNegotiations with India for a power purchase agreement have been underway for\nseveral years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem.\nCurrently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's\noption to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.\nAs of June 2022 surplus electricity up to 364 MWp by Nepal is exported to\nIndia.\n\nPopulation pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is\nalready straining the \"carrying capacity\" of the middle hill areas,\nparticularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover\nfor crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although\nsteep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, mineral surveys have\nfound small deposits of limestone, magnesite, zinc, copper, iron, mica, lead,\nand cobalt. Coal mining is also done with 11522 tones produced in 2018 alone.\n\nThe development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with\nlocal indigenous groups, recently[_when?_] empowered by Nepal's ratification\nof ILO Convention 169."
