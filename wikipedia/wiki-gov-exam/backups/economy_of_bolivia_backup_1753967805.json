Driven largely by its\nnatural resources, Bolivia has become a region leader in measures of economic\ngrowth, fiscal stability and foreign reserves, although it remains a\nhistorically poor country. The Bolivian economy has had a historic single-\ncommodity focus. From silver to tin to coca, Bolivia has enjoyed only\noccasional periods of economic diversification. Political instability and\ndifficult topography have constrained efforts to modernize the agricultural\nsector. Similarly, relatively low population growth coupled with low life\nexpectancy has kept the labor supply in flux and prevented industries from\nflourishing. Rampant inflation and corruption previously created development\nchallenges, but in the early twenty-first century the fundamentals of its\neconomy showed unexpected improvement, leading Moody's Investors Service to\nupgrade Bolivia's economic rating in 2010 from B2 to B1.

    "text": "Historical GDP per capita development\n\nBolivia was a major mineral exporter during the colonial period. The turbulent\nindependence period led to the collapse of the mining industry. By the 1840s,\nsilver production was half that of 1790. In the decades following 1850,\nBolivia experienced economic growth. Bolivia remained a primarily rural\ncountry into the 20th century. Tin production became Bolivia's main industry\nafter 1900.\n\nThe Bolivian economy grew rapidly between 1960 and 1977. According to one\nstudy, \"persistent deficits and a fixed exchange rate policy during the 1970s\nled to a debt crisis that began in 1977. From 1977 to 1986, Bolivia lost\nalmost all the gains in GDP per capita that it had achieved since 1960.\" After\n1986, Bolivian economy began to grow again. Between 1998 and 2002, Bolivia\nexperienced a financial crisis.\n\nInflation has plagued, and at times crippled, the Bolivian economy since the\n1970s. At one time in 1985 Bolivia experienced an annual inflation rate of\nmore than 20,000 percent. Fiscal and monetary reform reduced the inflation\nrate to single digits by the 1990s, and in 2004 Bolivia experienced a\nmanageable 4.9 percent rate of inflation. A major blow to the Bolivian economy\ncame with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which\nimpacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining\nindustries.\n\nSince 1985 the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of\nmacroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price\nstability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity.\nA major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency\nin this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-\nliberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors,\nthat have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded\nnational treatment.\n\nIn April 2000 Hugo Banzer, the former president of Bolivia, signed a contract\nwith Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water\nsupply in Bolivia's third-largest city, Cochabamba. Shortly thereafter, the\ncompany tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in\nprotests and rioting among those who could no longer afford clean water.\nAmidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over\nthe state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the\nwater contract.\n\nOnce Bolivia's government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance\ndevelopment projects and to pay the public staff. At the end of 2002, the\ngovernment owed $4.5 billion to its foreign creditors, with $1.6 billion of\nthis amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to\nmultilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been\nrescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the Paris Club mechanism.\nExternal creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian\ngovernment has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF\nprograms since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally\ngood record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the\ngovernment budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports\nto Brazil and Argentina of natural gas. Parallel legislative reforms have\nlocked into place market-oriented policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and\ntelecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign\ninvestors are accorded national treatment, and foreign ownership of companies\nenjoys virtually no restrictions in Bolivia. While the capitalization program\nwas successful in vastly boosting foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bolivia\n(US$7 billion in stock during 1996–2002), FDI later decreased as investors\ncompleted their capitalization contract obligations.\n\nIn 1996 three units of the Bolivian state oil corporation (YPFB) involved in\nhydrocarbon exploration, production, and transportation were capitalized,\nfacilitating the construction of a gas pipeline to Brazil. The government has\na long-term sales agreement to sell 30 million cubic metres a day (MMcmd) of\nnatural gas to Brazil through 2019. The Brazil pipeline carried about 21 MMcmd\nin 2000. Bolivia has the second-largest natural gas reserves in South America,\nand its current domestic use and exports to Brazil account for just a small\nportion of its potential production. Natural gas exports to Argentina resumed\nin 2004 at four MMcmd.\n\nIn April 2000 violent protests over plans to privatize the water utility in\nthe city of Cochabamba led to nationwide disturbances. The government\neventually cancelled the contract without compensation to the investors,\nreturning the utility to public control. The foreign investors in this project\npursued an investment dispute case against Bolivia for its actions. A similar\nsituation occurred in 2005 in the cities of El Alto and La Paz.\n\nProtest and widespread opposition to exporting gas through Chile led to the\nresignation of President Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003. The government\nheld a binding referendum in 2004 on plans to export natural gas and on\nhydrocarbons law reform. By May 2005, the carbons law draft was being\nconsidered by the Senate.\n\nAccording to the data of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, as\nwell as several international Institutes such as ECLAC, during the period 2006\nto 2019 (period of the presidency of Evo Morales and Alvaro Garcia Linera) the\neconomy of Bolivia quadrupled from a value of 9,573 billion dollars to 42,401\nbillion dollars, this is due in large part to the policy of nationalization of\nNatural Resources, the stability of the exchange rate, the incentive of the\ndomestic market, strong public investment in infrastructure and\nindustrialization of natural resources such as gas and lithium. Similarly,\naccording to studies by the World Bank and ECLAC, during the period 2006–2019,\nBolivia experienced a marked reduction in poverty and extreme poverty,\nresulting in a reduction of the population living in extreme poverty from\n38.2% to 15.2%. In terms of HDI, according to the UNDP World Human Development\nReport, Bolivia in 2018 for the first time became classified as a \"high human\ndevelopment Country\", reaching an HDI indicator of 0.703 and rising to the\n114th position of 189 countries and territories.",

Its standard of living, as\nmeasured in GDP in PPP per capita was US$7,191. Economic growth was about 5.2%\na year and inflation was 4.5% in 2012. Bolivia experienced a budget surplus of\nabout 1.5% of GDP in 2012. Expenditures were nearly US$12.2 billion while\nrevenues amounted to about US$12.6 billion. The government runs surplus\naccounts since 2005.\n\nThe Bolivian currency is the boliviano (ISO 4217: BOB; symbol: Bs.) One\nboliviano is divided into 100 centavos.

    "text": "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing accounted for 14 percent of Bolivia's gross\ndomestic product (GDP) in 2003, down from 28 percent in 1986. Combined, these\nactivities employ nearly 44 percent of Bolivia's workers. Most agricultural\nworkers are engaged in subsistence farming—the dominant economic activity of\nthe highlands region. Agricultural production in Bolivia is complicated by\nboth the country's topography and climate. High elevations make farming\ndifficult, as do the El Niño weather patterns and seasonal flooding. Bolivia's\nagricultural GDP continues to rise but has attained only a rather modest\naverage growth rate of 2.8 percent annually since 1991.\n\nBolivia's most lucrative agricultural product continues to be coca, of which\nBolivia is currently the world's third largest cultivator after Colombia and\nPeru, with an estimated 29,500 hectares under cultivation in 2007, slightly\nhigher than the previous year.[_citation needed_] Bolivia is the third-largest\nproducer of cocaine, a drug produced from coca, estimated at 120 metric tons\npotential pure cocaine in 2007 and a transit country for Peruvian and\nColombian cocaine destined illegally for the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Argentina,\nChile, and Paraguay.[_citation needed_] The Bolivian government, in response\nto international pressure, worked to restrict coca cultivation. However,\neradication efforts have hampered by the lack of a suitable replacement crop\nfor rural communities that have cultivated coca for generations. The Morales\ngovernment turned back some of the results which was obtained in previous\nyears.[_citation needed_]\n\nSince 2001 Bolivia's leading legal agricultural export has been soybeans.\nAdditionally, cotton, coffee, and sugarcane have been viable exports for\nBolivia. For domestic consumption, corn, wheat, and potatoes are the crops of\nchoice of Bolivian farmers. Despite its vast forests, Bolivia has only a minor\ntimber industry. In 2003 timber accounted for only 3.5 percent of export\nearnings. The Forestry Law of 1996 imposed a tax on sawn lumber and\nconsequently cut Bolivian lumber exports significantly. The tax was used to\nestablish the Forestry Stewardship Council, which has been only minimally\nsuccessful in forest restoration efforts and eliminating illegal logging. With\nincreased efficiency, Bolivia could likely expand the profitability of its\nforest resources, while still protecting them from overexploitation. Bolivia\nhas a small fishing industry that taps the country's freshwater lakes and\nstreams. The annual catch averages about 6,000 tons.\n\nIn 2018, Bolivia produced 9.6 million tons of sugarcane, 2.9 million tons of\nsoy, 1.2 million tons of maize, 1.1 million tons of potato, 1 million tons of\nsorghum, 700 thousand tons of banana, 541 thousand tons of rice, 301 thousand\ntons of wheat, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products,\nsuch as tangerine, cassava, orange, beans, sunflower seed, cotton etc.\n\nSatellite view of coca leaf and tropical fruit plantations in the Ivirgazama\nregion of Bolivia. Several tropical areas in the country have experienced\nmajor deforestation.\n\nAgriculture and forestry is also the lifeline for multitudes of small villages\nwhich house a majority of the population. Small village economy stumbled and\ndwindled from the late twentieth century due to aggravating environmental\nproblems including deforestation and consequent soil degradation, water\npollution, loss of biodiversity, and so on. Besides, political and social\nproblems also greatly obstruct the growth of small village development:\npolitical turmoil, post-civil war predicament and burgeoning fiscal deficit\nhave strangled most investment incentives; corruption and manipulation of\nwater supply by foreign companies have greatly undermined the availability and\nefficiency of local market, leaving little profits for village farmers and\nproducers. Furthermore, the global market poses a threat to the stability and\nsustainability of Bolivia's frail economy: \"a drop in export prices, reduction\nof informal trade\" and low-skilled over-homogenized local products have\nfurther worsened the bleak condition of Bolivia's microeconomic activities,\nmaking it almost impossible for village farms and factories to make a living\nfrom trading with the world. Dwindling profits and surging cost of production\nhave made small village economy in Bolivia extremely vulnerable and unstable;\nas a result, unemployment increases and small business is on the verge of\nbankruptcy, which in return made government intervention very inefficient and\ndeferred many governmental initiatives and attempts to improve the condition.",

The collapse of the world\ntin market in the 1980s led to a restructuring of the industry. The state\ndramatically reduced its control and presently operates only a small portion\nof mining activities. Small-scale operations, often with low productivity,\nemploy many former state miners. Natural gas has supplanted tin and silver as\nthe country's most valuable natural commodity. A discovery in 1997 confirmed a\ntenfold gain in Bolivia's known natural gas reserves. Finding markets to\nutilize this resource, both domestically and internationally, has been slowed\nby a lack of infrastructure and conflicts over the state's role in controlling\nnatural resources. Although the world tin market has re-emerged, Bolivia now\nfaces stiff competition from Southeast Asian countries producing lower-cost\nalluvial tin. Gold and silver production has increased dramatically over the\npast decade. Annually, as of 2002 Bolivia extracted and exported more than\n11,000 kilograms of gold and 461 tons of silver.
