    "text": "The **economy of Honduras** is based mostly on agriculture, which accounts for\n14% of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. The country's leading export\nis coffee (US$340 million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran\nexport revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until\nbeing virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57%\nof pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector.\nSince the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through\nmaquiladoras, especially in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortés.\n\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral resources, although\nwidespread slash and burn agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran\nforests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-\ninduced recession (−1.9%) of 1999. The Honduran maquiladora sector, the third-\nlargest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing\nemployment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528 million in foreign\nexchange for the country. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index,\nwas 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The\ncountry's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at\nslightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly\nin the United States) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency)\nwas devaluing for many years, but stabilized at L19 to the United States\ndollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America;\ngross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central\nAmerica is $6,736. Honduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western\nHemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer. Using alternative\nstatistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide\ngreater context for the nation's poverty.\n\nThe country signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) – later\nconverted to a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) with the\nInternational Monetary Fund in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year\n2000) continues to maintain stable macroeconomic policies. It has not been\nswift in implementing structural changes, such as privatization of the\npublicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies—changes which are\ndesired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received\nsignificant debt relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, including the\nsuspension of bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by\nthe Paris Club—including the United States – worth over $400 million. In July\n2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral\ndebt relief.\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of\napparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged,\nmountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow\nstrips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing\nsector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing\nindustries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition\nfrom more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more\ncomplex industrialization.\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE),\n73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty. The\ncountry is among the most unequal in the world.",

    "text": "Honduras's international economic activity surged in the early 20th century.\nBetween 1913 and 1929, its agricultural exports rose from $3 million ($2\nmillion from bananas) to $25 million ($21 million from bananas). These\n\"golden\" exports were supported by more than $40 million of specialized banana\ncompany investment in the Honduran infrastructure and were safeguarded by US\npressure on the national government when the companies felt threatened.\n\nThe overall performance of the Honduran economy remained closely tied to\nbanana prices and production from the 1920s until after the mid-century\nbecause other forms of commercial export agriculture were slow to emerge. In\naddition, until drastically reduced in the mid-1950s, the workforce associated\nwith banana cultivation represented a significant proportion of the wage\nearners in the country. Just before the banana industry's largest strike in\n1954, approximately 35,000 workers held jobs on the banana plantations of the\nUnited Fruit Company (later United Brands Company, then Chiquita Brands\nInternational) or the Standard Fruit Company (later brought by Castle and\nCook, then Dole Food Company).\n\nAfter 1950 Honduran governments encouraged agricultural modernization and\nexport diversification by spending heavily on transportation and\ncommunications infrastructure, agricultural credit, and technical assistance.\nDuring the 1950s—as a result of these improvements and the strong\ninternational export prices—beef, cotton, and coffee became significant export\nproducts for the first time. Honduran sugar, timber, and tobacco also were\nexported, and by 1960 bananas had declined to a more modest share (45 percent)\nof total exports. During the 1960s, industrial growth was stimulated by the\nestablishment of the Central American Common Market (CACM—see Appendix B).\n\nAs a result of the reduction of regional trade barriers and the construction\nof a high common external tariff, some Honduran manufactured products, such as\nsoaps, sold successfully in other Central American countries. Because of the\ngreater size and relative efficiency of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan\nindustrial sectors, however, Honduras bought far more manufactured products\nfrom its neighbors than it sold to them. After the 1969 Soccer War with El\nSalvador, Honduras effectively withdrew from the CACM. Favorable bilateral\ntrade arrangements between Honduras and the other former CACM partners were\nsubsequently negotiated, however.\n\nDowntown San Pedro Sula in 2004.\n\nA political shift in the 1980s had strong and unexpected repercussions on the\ncountry's economic condition. Beginning in late 1979, as insurgency spread in\nneighboring countries, Honduran military leaders enthusiastically came to\nsupport United States policies in the region. This alignment resulted in\nfinancial support that benefited the civilian as well as the military\nministries and agencies of Honduras. Honduran defense spending rose throughout\nthe 1980s until it consumed 20 to 30 percent of the national budget. Before\nthe military buildup began in fiscal year (FY) 1980, United States military\nassistance to Honduras was less than US$4 million. Military aid more than\ndoubled to reach just under US$9 million by FY 1981, surged to more than $31\nmillion by FY 1982, and stood at $48.3 million in FY 1983. Tiny Honduras soon\nbecame the tenth largest recipient of United States assistance aid; total\neconomic and military aid rose to more than $200 million in 1985 and remained\nat more than $100 million for the rest of the 1980s.\n\nThe increasing dependence of the Honduran economy on foreign aid was\naggravated by a severe, regionwide economic decline during the 1980s. Private\ninvestment plummeted in 1980, and capital flight for that year was $500\nmillion. To make matters worse, coffee prices plunged on the international\nmarket in the mid-1980s and remained low throughout the decade. In 1993\naverage annual per capita income remained depressingly low at about $580, and\n75 percent of the population was poor by internationally defined standards.\n\nTraditionally, Honduran economic hopes have been pinned on land and\nagricultural commodities. Despite those hopes, however, usable land has always\nbeen severely limited. Honduras's mostly mountainous terrain confines\nagriculturally exploitable land to narrow bands along the coasts and to some\npreviously fertile but now largely depleted valleys. The country's once\nabundant forest resources have also been dramatically reduced, and Honduras\nhas not derived economically significant income from mineral resources since\nthe 19th century. Similarly, Honduras's industrial sector never was fully\ndeveloped. The heady days of the CACM (mid to -late 1960s), which produced an\nindustrial boom for El Salvador and Guatemala, barely touched the Honduran\neconomy except to increase its imports because of the comparative advantages\nenjoyed by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan economies and Honduras's inability to\ncompete.\n\nBananas and coffee have also proven unreliable sources of income. Although\nbananas are less subject to the vagaries of international markets than coffee,\nnatural disasters such as Hurricane Fifi in 1974, drought, and disease have\nappeared with a regular, albeit random, frequency to take their economic toll\nthrough severely diminished harvests. Moreover, bananas are grown and marketed\nmostly by international corporations, which keep the bulk of wealth generated.\nCoffee exports, equally unreliable as a major source of economic support,\nsurpassed bananas in the mid1970s as Honduras's leading export income earner,\nbut international price declines coupled with huge fiscal deficits underlined\nthe vulnerability of coffee as an economic base.",

    "text": "| This section **is missing information** about the devastating effects of\nHurricane Mitch on this nation. Didn't it cause a recession here in 1998?.\nPlease expand the section to include this information. Further details may\nexist on the talk page. _( September 2018)_\n---|---\n\nAs Honduras entered the 1990s, it did have some factors working in its\nfavor—relative peace and a stronger civilian government with less military\ninterference in the politics and economy of the country than in past years.\nThe country was hobbled, however, by horrendous foreign debt, could claim only\ndiminished natural resources, and had one of the fastest-growing and\nurbanizing populations in the world. The government's daunting task then\nbecame how to create an economic base able to compensate for the withdrawal of\nmuch United States assistance without becoming solely dependent on traditional\nagricultural exports.\n\nIn the 1990s, bananas were booming again, particularly as new European trade\nagreements increased market size. Small banana producing cooperatives lined up\nin the 1990s to sell their land to the commercial giants, and the last banana-\nproducing lands held by the government were privatized. Like most of Central\nAmerica, Honduras in the 1990s began to woo foreign investors, mostly Asian\nclothing assembly firms, and it held high hopes for revenue to be generated by\nprivatizing national industries. With one of the most strike-prone labor\nforces in Central America, debt-burdened and aging industrial assets, and a\ndramatically underdeveloped infrastructure, Honduras, however, has distinct\neconomic disadvantages relative to its Central American and Caribbean\nneighbors, who compete with Honduras in the same export markets.\n\nHonduran president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, elected in November 1989,\nenjoyed little success in the early part of his administration as he attempted\nto adhere to a standard economic austerity package prescribed by the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. As the November 1993\npresidential elections drew closer, the political fallout of austere economic\nmeasures made their implementation even less likely. Any hope for his party's\nwinning the 1993 election was predicated on improving social programs,\naddressing employment needs, and appeasing a disgruntled, vocal public sector.\nHowever, reaching those goals required policies that moved away from balancing\nthe budget, lowering inflation, and reducing the deficit and external debt to\nattract investment and stimulate economic growth.\n\nCallejas inherited an economic mess. The economy had deteriorated rapidly,\nstarting in 1989, as the United States Agency for International Development\n(AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal\ndispleasure with the economic policies of the old government and to push the\nnew government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly\nexacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral\nlending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the\nreduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would\nbe conditioned first on payment of arrears on the country's enormous external\ndebt.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, the government of Honduras—pumped up by massive\ninfusions of external borrowing—had introduced expensive, high-tech\ninfrastructure projects. The construction of roads and dams, financed mostly\nby multilateral loans and grants, was intended to generate employment to\ncompensate for the impact of the regionwide recession. In reality, the\ndevelopment projects served to swell the ranks of public-sector employment and\nline the pockets of a small elite. The projects never sparked private-sector\ninvestment or created substantial private employment. Instead, per capita\nincome continued to fall as Honduras's external debt doubled. Even greater\ninjections of foreign assistance between 1985 and 1988 kept the economy\nafloat, but it soon became clear that the successive governments had been\nborrowing time as well as money.\n\nForeign aid between 1985 and 1989 represented about 4.6 percent of the gross\ndomestic product (GDP). About 44 percent of the government's fiscal shortfall\nwas financed through cash from foreign sources. Side effects of the cash\ninfusion were that the national currency, the lempira became overvalued and\nthe number of exports dropped. A booming public sector, with its enhanced\nability to import, was enough to keep the economy showing growth, based on\nprivate consumption and government spending. But the government did little to\naddress the historical, underlying structural problems of the economy—its\noverdependence on too few traditional commodities and lack of investment.\nUnemployment mushroomed, and private investment withered.\n\nBy 1989 president Callejas's broad economic goal led a return of Honduran\neconomic growth to 1960–80 levels. During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s,\nthe country's economy, spurred mostly by erratically fluctuating traditional\nagricultural commodities, nevertheless averaged real annual growth of between\n4 and 5 percent. At the end of the 1980s, however, Callejas had few remaining\nvehicles with which to pull the country out of the deep regionwide recession\nof the 1980s. Real growth between 1989 and 1993 translated to mostly negative\nor small positive per capita changes in the GDP for a population that was\ngrowing at close to 4 percent annually.\n\nPresident Callejas attempted to adhere to conditions of desperately needed new\nloans. Cutting the size of the public sector workforce, lowering the deficit,\nand enhancing revenues from taxes—as mandated by the multilateral lending\ninstitutions—were consistently his biggest stumbling blocks. Despite his all-\nout effort to reduce the public-sector deficit, the overall ratio of fiscal\ndeficit to the GDP in 1990 showed little change from that in 1989. The total\npublic-sector deficit actually grew to 8.6 percent of the GDP, or nearly L1\nbillion, in 1991.\n\nThe 1993 deficit expanded to 10.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran government's\nmedium-term economic objectives, as dictated by the IMF, were to have\ngenerated real GDP growth of 3.5 percent by 1992 and 4 percent by 1993. In\nfact, GDP growth was 3.3 percent in 1991, 5.6 percent in 1992, and an\nestimated 3.7 percent in 1993. The economy had operated so long on an ad hoc\nbasis that it lacked the tools to implement coherent economic objectives.\nSolving the most immediate crisis frequently took precedence over long-term\ngoals.",

    "text": "Between 1980 and 1983, 20 percent of the workforce was unemployed—double the\npercentage of the late 1970s. Job creation remained substantially behind the\ngrowth of the labor force throughout the 1980s. Unemployment grew to 25\npercent by 1985, and combined unemployment and underemployment jumped to 40\npercent in 1989. By 1993, 50 to 60 percent of the Honduran labor force was\nestimated to be either underemployed or unemployed.\n\nThe government's acceptance of foreign aid during the 1980s, in lieu of\neconomic growth sparked by private investment, allowed it to ignore the\nnecessity of creating new jobs. Honduras's GDP showed reasonable growth\nthroughout most of the 1980s, especially when compared to the rest of Latin\nAmerica, but it was artificially buoyed by private consumption and public-\nsector spending.\n\nMainstay agricultural jobs became scarcer in the late 1970s. Coffee harvests\nand plantings in border area decreased because fighting in neighboring\nNicaragua and El Salvador spilled over into Honduras. Other factors\ncontributing to the job scarcity were limited land, a reluctance on the part\nof coffee growers to invest while wars destabilized the region, and a lack of\ncredit. Small farmers became increasingly unable to support themselves as\ntheir parcels of land diminished in size and productivity.\n\nProblems in the agricultural sector have fueled urbanization. The Honduran\npopulation was 77 percent rural in 1960. By 1992 only 55 percent of the\nHonduran population continued to live in rural areas. Peasants (campesinos)\nflocked to the cities in search of work but found little there. Overall\nunemployment has been exacerbated by an influx of refugees from the wars in\nneighboring countries, attracted to Honduras, ironically, by its relatively\nlow population density and relative peace. In the agricultural sector (which\nin 1993 still accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force), unemployment\nhas been estimated to be far worse than the figures for the total labor force.\n\nHonduran urban employment in the early 1990s has been characterized by\nunderemployment and marginal informal-sector jobs, as thousands of former\nagricultural workers and refugees have moved to the cities seeking better\nlives. Few new jobs have been generated in the formal sector, however, because\nthe domestic private sector and foreign investments have dropped and coveted\npublic-sector jobs have been reserved mostly for the small Honduran middle-\nclass with political or military connections. Only one of ten Honduran workers\nwere securely employed in the formal sector in 1991.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the World Bank reported that only 10,000 new jobs were\ncreated annually; the low rate of job creation resulted in 20,000 people being\nadded to the ranks of the unemployed every year. The actual disparity between\njobs needed for full employment and new jobs created exceeded that projection,\nhowever. For those with jobs, the buying power of their wages tumbled\nthroughout the 1980s while the cost of basic goods, especially food, climbed\nprecipitously.",

    "text": "Throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the military-led governments of\nHonduras ran a state-sponsored and state-financed economy. The governments\nprovided most guarantees for loans to a strong but patronage-dominated and\nsomewhat corrupt public sector that included recipients of graft extracted\nfrom foreign and domestic investors, and to costly state-developed\nenterprises. By 1989 and the election of president Rafael Leonardo Callejas\nRomero, however, a heavy toll had been taken by regionwide economic recession,\ncivil war in neighboring countries, the drying up of most external credit, and\ncapital flight equaling more than $1.5 billion.\n\nPresident Callejas shifted the Honduran economy towards privatization\n\nCallejas began to shift economic policy toward privatizing government-owned\nenterprises, liberalizing trade and tariff regulations, and encouraging\nincreased foreign investment through tax and other incentives. The Callejas\nadministration did not seek less government control. Rather it changed the\ngovernment's objectives by focusing on reducing public-sector spending, the\nsize of the public-sector workforce, and the trade deficit. Overall economic\nplanning became the responsibility of the National Superior Planning Council,\ndirected by the minister of economy and commerce. President Callejas, a US-\ntrained economist, brought new professionalism and technical skills to the\ncentral government as he began the arduous task of long-term economic reform.\n\nThe official exchange rate of the lempira, pegged at US$1=L2 since 1918, was\ndramatically devalued in 1990. Exchange controls had been introduced in 1982,\nresulting in a parallel currency market (black market) and several confusing\nofficial exchange rates operating simultaneously. Some of those rates were\nlegally recognized in 1990 when President Callejas introduced a major series\nof economic policy reforms, which included reducing the maximum import tariff\nrate from 90 to 40 percent and getting rid of most surcharges and exemptions.\n\nThe value of the lempira was adjusted to US$1=L4, with the exception of the\nrate for debt equity conversions, which remained at the old rate of US$1=L2.\nThe official conversion rate of the lempira fell to US$1=L7.26 in December\n1993. The president also introduced temporary taxes on exports, which were\nintended to increase central government revenue. Additional price and trade\nliberalization measures and fewer government regulations became part of his\nongoing reforms."

    "text": "Throughout the 1980s, the Honduran government was heavily financed by foreign\nassistance. External financing—mostly bilateral credit from the United\nStates—rose dramatically until it reached 87 percent of the public deficit in\n1985, rising even further in subsequent years. By 1991 the public-sector\ndeficit was entirely financed with net external credit. That financing\npermitted the government to reduce the demand for internal credit and,\ntherefore, to maintain its established exchange rate.\n\nIn 1991 Callejas managed to give the appearance of having reduced the overall\nfiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. But the deficit decrease was\nmostly an accounting device because it resulted from the postponement of\nexternal payments to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by\npressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with\nmultilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras $39.5 million\nin United States development assistance, $70 million in balance-of-payments\nassistance in the form of cash grants, and $18.8 million in food aid.\n\nHonduras country also negotiated $302.4 million in concessional loans from the\nmultilateral lending institutions. Total outstanding external debt as a\npercentage of GDP fell from 119 percent in 1990 to 114 percent in 1991 and to\n112 percent in 1993. This drop was largely the result of debt forgiveness of\n$448.4 million by the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.\nScheduled amortization payments of an average $223.2 million per year,\nhowever, guaranteed that Honduras's gross funding requirements would remain\nlarge indefinitely.\n\nThe government of Honduras projected that overall tax revenues would increase\nfrom 13.2 percent of GDP in 1989 to about 15.7 percent in 1991. Adjustments\nfor low coffee prices and the continuation of lax collection methods, however,\nundermined those goals. Despite these tax increases, compared to developed\ncountries, Honduras has low tax rates with, particularly low property taxes."

    "text": "Honduras suffers from an overabundance of unskilled and uneducated laborers.\nMost Honduran workers in 1993 continued to be employed in agriculture, which\naccounted for about 60 percent of the labor force. More than half of the rural\npopulation, moreover, remains landless and heavily dependent on diminishing\nseasonal labor and low wages. Fifty-five percent of the farming population\nsubsists on less than two hectares and earns less than $70 per capita per year\nfrom those plots, mostly by growing subsistence food crops.\n\nIn 1993 only about 9–13 percent of the Honduran labor force was engaged in the\ncountry's tiny manufacturing sector—one of the smallest in Central America.\nSkilled laborers are scarce. Only 25,000 people per year, of which about 21\npercent are industrial workers, graduate yearly from the National Institute of\nProfessional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formación Profesional-INFOP)\nestablished in 1972.\n\nHundreds of small manufacturing firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran\nenterprise, began to go out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as\nimport costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor\nfrom the mostly Asian-owned assembly industries strengthened. The small\nHonduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for\nthe domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of\ncredit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans\nthan conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms\n(maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government\non the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the\npopulations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, Tela, and La Ceiba.\nThose firms employ approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.\n\nAbout one-third of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be working in the\nservice or \"other\" sector in 1993. That classification usually means that a\nperson ekes out a precarious livelihood in the urban informal sector or as a\npoorly paid domestic. As unemployment soared throughout Central America in the\n1980s, more and more people were forced to rely on their own ingenuity in\norder to simply exist on the fringes of Honduran society.\n\nAs for the informal sector, research has shown that evidence of child labor\nhas been observed mostly in the Honduran agricultural sector. In 2014, the\nU.S. Department of Labor's _List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced\nLabor_ cites three goods produced in such working conditions in Honduras;\nnamely coffee, lobsters and melons."

    "text": "Honduran governments have set minimum wages since 1974, but enforcement has\ngenerally been lax. That laxity increased at the beginning of the 1980s.\nTraditionally, most Honduran workers have not been covered by social security,\nwelfare, or minimum wages. Multinational companies usually paid more than the\nstandard minimum wage, but, overall, the Honduran wage earner has experienced\na diminution of real wages and purchasing ability for more than a decade. When\nthey occurred, minimum wage adjustments generally did not keep up with the\ncost of living increases.\n\nAfter a major currency devaluation in 1990, average Honduran workers were\namong the most poorly paid workers in the Western Hemisphere. By contrast, the\nbanana companies paid relatively high wages as early as the 1970s. Banana\nworkers continued at the top of the wage scale in the 1990s; however, in the\n1980s, as banana production became less labor-intensive, the companies had\ndecreased their investment and workforce. Consequently, fewer workers were\nemployed as relatively well-paid agricultural wage earners with related\nbenefits.\n\nPresident Callejas responded to the severe poverty by implementing a specially\nfinanced Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondureño de Inversión\nSocial—FHIS) in 1990. The fund created public works programs such as road\nmaintenance and provided United States surplus food to mothers and infants.\nMany Hondurans slipped through that fragile social safety net. As a continuing\npart of the social pact, and even more as the result of a fierce union-\ngovernment battle, President Callejas announced in 1991 a 27.8 percent\nincrease over a minimum wage that the government had earlier agreed upon. That\nincrease was in addition to raises of 50 and 22 percent set, respectively, in\nJanuary and September 1990. Despite those concessions, the minimum daily rate\nin 1991 was only $1.75 for workers employed by small agricultural enterprises\nand $3.15 for workers in the big exporting concerns; most workers did not earn\nthe minimum wage."

    "text": "Honduras has long been heavily unionized. In 1993 approximately 15 to 20\npercent of the overall formal workforce was represented by some type of union,\nand about 40 percent of urban workers were union members. There were forty-\neight strikes in the public sector alone in 1990, protesting the government's\neconomic austerity program and layoffs of public-sector workers. More than\n4,000 public-sector employees from the Ministry of Communications, Public\nWorks, and Transport were fired in 1990. About 70,000 unionized workers\nremained in the faltering public sector at the beginning of 1991. However, the\ngovernment largely made good its pledge to trim that number by 8,000 to 10,000\nthroughout 1991 as part of its austerity program.\n\nIn the private sector, 1990 saw 94 strikes in 64 firms, as workers fought for\nwage increases to combat inflation. A forty-two-day strike at the Tela\nRailroad Company (owned by Chiquita Brands International—formerly United\nBrands and United Fruit Company) was unsuccessful, however, and that defeat\ntemporarily ended union efforts at direct confrontation.\n\nIn 1993 Honduras had three major labor confederations: the Confederation of\nHonduran Workers (Confederación de Trabajadores de Honduras—CTH), claiming a\nmembership of about 160,000 workers; the General Workers Central (Central\nGeneral de Trabajadores—CGT), claiming to represent 120,000 members; and the\nUnitary Confederation of Honduran Workers (Confederación Unitaria de\nTrabajadores de Honduras—CUTH), a new confederation formed in May 1992, with\nan estimated membership of about 30,000. The three confederations included\nnumerous trade union federations, individual unions, and peasant\norganizations.\n\nThe CTH, the nation's largest trade confederation, was formed in 1964 by the\nnation's largest peasant organization, the National Association of Honduran\nPeasants (Asociación Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras—Anach), and by\nHonduran unions affiliated with the Inter-American Regional Organization of\nWorkers (Organización Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores—ORIT), a\nhemispheric labor organization with close ties to the American Federation of\nLabor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the confederation had three major components: the\n45,000-member Federation of Unions of National Workers of Honduras (Federación\nSindical de Trabajadores Nacionales de Honduras—Fesitranh); the 22,000 member\nCentral Federation of Honduran Free Trade Unions (Federación Central de\nSindicatos Libres de Honduras); and the 2,200-member Federation of National\nMaritime Unions of Honduras (Federación de Sindicales Marítimas Nacionales de\nHonduras). In addition, Anach, claiming to represent between 60,000 and 80,000\nmembers, was affiliated with Fesitranh.\n\nFesitranh was by far the country's most powerful labor federation, with most\nof its unions located in San Pedro Sula and the Puerto Cortés Free Zone. The\nunions of the United States-owned banana companies and the United States-owned\npetroleum refinery also were affiliated with Fesitranh. The CTH received\nsupport from foreign labor organizations, including ORIT, the American\nInstitute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), and Germany's Friedrich Ebert\nFoundation and was an affiliate of the International Confederation of Free\nTrade Unions (ICFTU).\n\nAlthough it was not legally recognized until 1982, the CGT was originally\nformed in 1970 by the Christian Democrats and received external support from\nthe World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the Latin American Workers Central\n(Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores—CLAT), a regional organization\nsupported by Christian Democratic parties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s,\nhowever, the CGT leadership developed close ties to the National Party of\nHonduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras—PNH), and several leaders served in the\nCallejas government. Another national peasant organization, the National Union\nof Peasants (Unión Nacional de Campesinos—UNC), claiming a membership of\n40,000, was affiliated with the CGT for many years and was a principal force\nwithin the confederation.\n\nThe CUTH was formed in May 1992 by two principal labor federations, the\nUnitary Federation of Honduran Workers (Federación Unitaria de Trabajadores de\nHonduras—FUTH) and the Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (Federación\nIndependiente de Trabajadores de Honduras—FITH), as well as several smaller\nlabor groups, all critical of the Callejas government's neoliberal economic\nreform program.\n\nThe Marxist FUTH, with an estimated 16,000 members in the early 1990s, was\nfirst organized in 1980 by three communist-influenced unions, but did not\nreceive legal status until 1988. The federation had external ties with the\nWorld Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the Permanent Congress for Latin\nAmerican Workers Trade Union Unity (Congreso Permanente de Unidad Sindical de\nTrabajadores de América Latina—CPUSTAL), and the Central American Committee of\nTrade Union Unity (Comité de Unidad Sindical de Centroamérica—CUSCA). Its\naffiliations included water utility, university, electricity company, brewery,\nand teacher unions, as well as several peasant organizations, including the\nNational Central of Farm Workers (Central Nacional de Trabajadores del\nCampo—CNTC), formed in 1985 and active in land occupations in the early 1980s.\n\nFUTH also became affiliated with a number of leftist popular organizations in\na group known as the Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations (Comité\nCoordinadora de las Organizaciones Populares—CCOP) that was formed in 1984.\nDissident FUTH member formed the FITH, which was granted legal status in 1988.\nThe FITH consisted of fourteen unions claiming about 13,000 members in the\nearly 1990s."

In addition, it produced 704 thousand tons of maize, 261\nthousand tons of orange, 293 thousand tons of melon, 127 thousand tons of\nbeans and 81 thousand tons of pineapple, in addition to smaller yields of\nother agricultural products such as watermelon, potato, tomato, cabbage,\ngrapefruit, sorghum etc.\n\nThe total land area of Honduras is 11.2 million hectares, of which a scant 1.7\nmillion hectares (about 15 percent) are well suited for agriculture. Most land\nin Honduras is covered by mountains, giving rise to the country's nickname,\n\"the Tibet of Central America.\" Nevertheless, the Honduran economy has always\ndepended almost exclusively on agriculture, and in 1992 agriculture was still\nthe largest sector of the economy, contributing 28 percent to the GDP.\n\nLess than half of Honduras's cultivable land was planted with crops as\nrecently as the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and\nwas owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for\nadditional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because\nmuch of Honduras's soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in\nCentral America. By 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been\nseriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn\nsquatters who planted unsuitable food crops.\n\nThe Honduran government and two banana companies—Chiquita Brands International\nand Dole Food Company—owned approximately 60 percent of Honduras's cultivable\nland in 1993. The banana companies acquired most of their landholdings in the\nearly 20th century in return for building the railroads used to transport\nbananas from the interior to the coast. Much of their land remained unused\nbecause it lacked irrigation. Only about 14 percent of cultivated land was\nirrigated in 1987. Most land under cultivation in 1992 was planted in bananas,\ncoffee, and specialized export crops such as melons and winter vegetables."

    "text": "The agricultural sector's output showed little or no growth between 1970 and\n1985. As a result of favorable weather and market conditions beginning in\n1995, however, the agricultural sector grew at a rate of 2.6 percent annually,\nslightly above the average for Latin America during that period. Production of\nbasic grains and coffee increased; the export price of bananas was high; and\npork, poultry, and milk produced for the domestic market increased.\nNontraditional fruits and vegetables also increased in value.\n\nHonduran agricultural production overall has tended to be low because the\namount of crop yielded by a given amount of land has been low. For example,\nHonduran chocolate yields historically have been only about half those of\nCosta Rica. Instead of using improved techniques to increase the productivity\nof the land, Honduran farmers have merely expanded the hectarage under\ncultivation to produce more crops—pushing their fields ever farther into the\nforests. Given the limited amount of good quality agricultural land, to begin\nwith, that policy has resulted in continual deforestation and subsequent\nerosion. This reluctance to improve techniques, coupled with generally poor\nsoil, a lack of credit, and poor infrastructure, has contributed to low\nproduction figures."

    "text": "The Honduran government nominally began to address inequitable land ownership\nin the early 1960s. Those efforts at reform focused on organizing rural\ncooperatives. About 1,500 hectares of government-owned land were distributed\nby the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario—INA) beginning\nin 1960.\n\nA military coup in 1963 resulted in an end to the land reform program. Lacking\neven modest government-directed land reforms, squatting became the primary\nmeans for poor people to gain land throughout the early 1970s. These actions\nspurred the government to institute new agrarian reforms in 1972 and 1975.\nAlthough all lands planted in export crops were exempted from reform, about\n120,000 hectares were, nevertheless, divided among 35,000 poor families.\n\nBy 1975 the pendulum had swung back, and agrarian reform was all but halted.\nFrom 1975 through the 1980s, illegal occupations of unused land increased once\nagain. The need for land reform was addressed mostly by laws directed at\ngranting titles to squatters and other landholders, permitting them to sell\ntheir land or to use it as collateral for loans.\n\nDespite declarations by the Callejas government in 1989 of its intent to\nincreasingly address social issues, including land tenure and other needs of\nsmall farmers, the early 1990s were jolted by increased conflicts between\npeasants and the Honduran security forces. Agricultural credit and government\nsupport increasingly favored export crop producers at the expense of producers\nof basic food crops.\n\nThe Honduran land reform process under President Callejas between 1989 and\n1992 was directed primarily at large agricultural landowners. An agrarian\npact, signed by landowners and peasant organizations in August 1990, remained\nunderfunded and largely unimplemented. Furthermore, violence erupted as\ndischarged members of the Honduran military forcibly tried to claim land that\nhad already been awarded to the peasant organization Anach in 1976.\n\nIn May 1991, violence initiated by members of the Honduran military resulted\nin the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country\nfrom escalating into violence, the government promised to parcel out land\nbelonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporación Nacional de\nInversiones—Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land\nthat had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.\n\nAn Agricultural Modernization Law, passed in 1992, accelerated land titling\nand altered the structure of land cooperatives formed in the 1960s. The law\npermitted cooperative members to break up their holdings into small personal\nplots that could be sold. As a result, some small banana producers suffering\nfrom economic hard times chose to sell their land to the giant banana\nproducers. After an agreement was reached with the European Union (EU) to\nincrease Honduras's banana quota to the EU, the large banana companies were\navid for additional land for increased production to meet the anticipated new\ndemand from Europe."

    "text": "Throughout the 20th century, Honduras's agriculture has been dominated first\nby bananas and then to a lesser extent by coffee and sugar. In 1992, bananas\nand coffee together accounted for 50 percent of the value of Honduran exports\nand made the biggest contribution to the economy. Total banana sales were $287\nmillion and total coffee sales amounted to $148 million. These figures are\nimpressive yet reflect production losses suffered by banana producers and the\nwithholding of coffee exports from the market in an effort to fight steep\nprice declines.\n\nAnother major blow to Honduran agriculture came from Hurricane Mitch and its\naftermath in 1998 and 1999. As of 2012 both industries are on the upswing. The\nbanana industry is dominated by Chiquita and the Dole Food Company, two\nmultinational corporations. The coffee industry, in contrast, offers better\nopportunities for small Honduran family farms to compete. Sugar has also been\nan important Honduran crop.\n\nChiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company now account for most\nHonduran banana production and exports. Honduras's traditional system of\nindependent banana producers, who, as late as the 1980s, sold their crops to\nthe international banana companies, was eroded in the 1990s. In the absence of\npolicies designed to protect independent suppliers, economically strapped\ncooperatives began to sell land to the two large corporations.\n\nAlthough Honduran banana production is dominated by multinational giants, such\nis not the case with coffee, which is grown by about 55,000 mostly small\nproducers. Coffee production in Honduras has been high despite relatively low\nindependent yields because of the large numbers of producers. Honduras, in\nfact, consistently produced more than its international quota until growers\nbegan to withhold the crop in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate higher\nprices. Despite the efforts of the growers, coffee prices plunged on the\ninternational market from a high of more than $2.25 per kilogram in the\nmid-1970s to less than $0.45 per kilogram in the early 1990s. As a result of\nthe declining prices, coffee producers were becoming increasingly\nmarginalized. With the aid of affordable loans from foreign investors, more\nand more Honduran coffee growers are learning to produce high-value organic\ncoffee for today's economy.\n\nThe outlook for the sugar industry, which had boomed during the 1980s when\nHonduran producers were allowed to fill Nicaragua's sugar quota to the United\nStates, seemed bleak in 1993. Restoration of the sugar quota to Nicaraguan\ngrowers has been a major blow to Honduras's small independent producers, who\nhad added most of Nicaragua's quota to their own during the United States\nembargo of Nicaragua. Higher costs for imported fertilizers because of the\ndevaluation of the lempira add to the problem.\n\nHonduran producers seek relief from a relatively low official price of 25\nlempiras per kilogram of sugar by smuggling sugar across the borders to\nNicaragua and El Salvador, where the support prices are higher. Sugar growers\nwho can afford it have begun to diversify by growing pineapples and rice. Many\nindependent sugar growers, like independent banana producers, have become\nindignant over the relatively high profits shown by refiners and exporters.\nStrikes by producers at harvest time in 1991 forced the closure of the\nCholuteca refinery for a short time but had little effect on the depressed\nlong-term outlook for the industry."

Nontraditional vegetables and fruit produced $23.8 million in\nexport revenue in 1990, a figure that was almost double the 1983 figure.\nNontraditional agricultural crops represented 4.8 percent of the value of\ntotal exports in 1990, compared to 2.8 percent in 1983.\n\nSome development experts argue that government protection of corn, bean, and\nrice production by small farmers is a futile effort in the long-term goal of\npoverty reduction. On the other hand, they see significant economic potential\nfor nontraditional crops, if they are handled properly. Analysts also note,\nhowever, that Honduras is at a distinct disadvantage relative to its Central\nAmerican neighbors because of its poor transportation system. Nontraditional\nexports require the ability to get fresh produce from the fields to distant\nmarkets rapidly."

    "text": "In the early 1980s, the cattle industry appeared to have the potential to be\nan important part of the Honduran economy. The Honduran cattle sector,\nhowever, never developed to the extent that it did in much of the rest of\nCentral America. Cattle production grew steadily until 1980–81 but then\ndeclined sharply when profits fell because of high production costs. The small\nHonduran meat packing industry declined at the same time, and several meat\npacking plants closed. As late as 1987, livestock composed 16 percent of the\nvalue-added agricultural sector but the industry continued to decline. By\n1991–92, beef exports accounted for only 2.9 percent of the value of total\nexports.\n\nSales of refrigerated meat were the third or fourth highest source of export\nearnings in the mid-1980s, but like other Honduran agricultural products, beef\nyields were among the lowest in Central America. As world prices fell and\nproduction costs, exacerbated by drought, rose, there was less incentive to\nraise cattle. For a period of time, cattle farmers illegally smuggled beef\ncattle to Guatemala and other neighboring countries where prices were higher,\nbut the Honduran cattle sector never became competitive internationally. The\ntwo large banana companies have also owned large cattle ranches where they\nraised prime beef, but these large companies had the flexibility to change\ncrops as the market demanded.\n\nHonduran dairy herds fared about the same as beef cattle, and Honduran milk\nyields were also among the lowest in Central America. The dairy industry was\nfurther handicapped by the difficulties of trying to transport milk over poor\nroads in a tropical country, as well as by stiff competition in the domestic\nmarket from subsidized foreign imports, mostly from the United States."

In 1992 shrimp and lobster jumped to 12 percent of export earnings.\nShrimp contributed $97 million in export sales to the economy in 1992—an\nincrease of 33 percent over the previous year. The industry was dependent,\nhowever, on larvae imported from the United States to augment its unstable\nnatural supply.\n\nTechnicians from Taiwan were contracted by large producers in 1991 to help\ndevelop laboratory larvae, but bitter feuds developed between independent\nshrimpers and the corporations. Local shrimpers charged that corporate methods\nwere damaging the environment and destroying natural stock through destruction\nof the mangrove breeding swamps. Corporate shrimp farmers then began to move\ntheir operations farther inland, leaving local shrimpers to contend with\ndiminished natural supplies on the mosquito-infested coast."

    "text": "As in much of Central America, Honduras's once abundant forest resources have\nbeen badly squandered. In 1964 forests covered 6.8 million hectares, but by\n1988 forested areas had declined to 5 million hectares. Honduras continued to\nlose about 3.6 percent of its remaining forests annually during the 1980s and\nearly 1990s. The loss is attributable to several factors. Squatters have\nconsistently used land suitable only for forests to grow scantyield food\ncrops; large tracts have been cleared for cattle ranches; and the country has\ngravely mismanaged its timber resources, focusing far more effort on logging\nthan on forestry management.\n\nThe government began an intensive forestry development program in 1974,\nsupposedly intended to increase management of the sector and to prevent\nexploitation by foreign-owned firms. The Honduran Corporation for Forestry\nDevelopment (Corporación Hondureña de Desarrollo Forestal—Cohdefor) was\ncreated in 1974, but it quickly developed into a corrupt monopoly for\noverseeing forest exports. Timber was mostly produced by private sawmills\nunder contracts selectively granted by Cohdefor officials.\n\nOngoing wasteful practices and an unsustainable debt, which was contracted to\nbuild infrastructure, appear to have undercut most conservation efforts. The\nmilitary-dominated governments contracted huge debt with the multilateral\ndevelopment agencies, then extracted timber to pay for it. Cohdefor generally\ngranted licenses to private lumber companies with few demands for\npreservation, and it had little inclination or incentive to enforce the\ndemands it did make.\n\nWith encouragement from the United States Agency for International Development\n(AID), the Honduran government began to decentralize Cohdefor beginning in\n1985. Under the decentralization plan, regulatory responsibilities were\ntransferred from the central government to mayors and other municipal\nofficials on the assumption that local officials would provide better\noversight. Despite decentralization and the sale of government assets,\nCohdefor's remaining debt was $240 million in 1991. The government also\nassumed continued financial responsibility for the construction of a new\nairstrip in the area of timber extraction, upgrading facilities at Puerto\nCastilla and Puerto Lempira, and providing electricity at reduced prices to\nlumber concerns as part of the privatization package.\n\nMajor legislation was passed in 1992 to promote Honduran reforestation by\nmaking large tracts of state-owned land more accessible to private investors.\nThe legislation also supplied subsidies for development of the sector. The\nsame law provided for replanting mountainous regions of the country with pine\nto be used for fuel."

The country\nhas never been a producer of petroleum and depends on imported oil to fill\nmuch of its energy needs. In 1991 Honduras consumed about 16,000 barrels\n(2,500 m3) of oil daily. Honduras spent about $143 million, or 13 percent of\nits total export earnings, to purchase oil in 1991. The country's one small\nrefinery at Puerto Cortés closed in 1993.\n\nVarious Honduran governments have done little to encourage oil exploration,\nalthough substantial oil deposits have long been suspected in the Río Sula\nvalley and offshore along the Caribbean coast. An oil exploration consortium\nconsisting of the Venezuelan state oil company, Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.\n(Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. or PDVSA), Cambria Oil, and Texaco expressed\ninterest in the construction of a refinery at Puerto Castilla in 1993, with\nproduction aimed at the local market.\n\nGasolineras Uno is a Honduran gas stations company that has expanded its\npresence to include stores in most of Central America and in South America.\n\nFuelwood and biomass have traditionally met about 67 percent of the country's\ntotal energy demand; petroleum, 29 percent; and electricity, 4 percent. In\n1987 Honduran households consumed approximately 60 percent of total energy\nused, transportation and agriculture used about 26 percent, and industry used\nabout 14 percent.

The country's total capacity in 1992 was 575 megawatts\n(MW), with 2,000 megawatt-hours produced. A mammoth hydroelectric plant, the\n292-MW project at El Cajón, began producing electricity in 1985 to help\naddress the country's energy needs. The plant, however, soon became heavily\nindebted because of the government's electricity pricing policies (not\ncharging public-sector institutions, for example) and because of the\nappointment of political cronies as top management officials. El Cajón also\ndeveloped costly structural problems requiring extensive maintenance and\nrepairs.\n\nOfficials estimated that the government's decision to provide free service to\npublic-sector institutions contributed to a 23 percent increase in\npublicsector consumption in 1990. Experts estimated that additional electrical\ngeneration capacity would likely be needed to keep pace with demand. The\nHonduran Congress assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in\n1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates.

    "text": "The country's manufacturing sector was small, contributing only 15 percent to\nthe total GDP in 1992. Textile exports, primarily to the US, led the Honduran\nmanufacturing sector. The maquiladora, or assembly industry, was a growth\nindustry in the generally bleak economy. Asian-owned firms dominated the\nsector, with twenty-one South Korean-owned companies in export processing\nzones located in the Río Sula valley in 1991.\n\nThe maquiladoras employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991; another nine\nfirms opened in 1992. Job creation, in fact, is considered to be the primary\ncontribution of the assembly operations to the domestic economy. The export\ntextile manufacturing industry all but wiped out small, Honduran\nmanufacturers, and food processors, whose goods were historically aimed at the\ndomestic market, were also adversely affected.\n\nThe small Honduran firms could not begin to compete with the assembly industry\nfor labor because of the maquiladoras' relatively high wage scale of close to\n$4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high\ncost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of\nSmall and Medium Industry (Asociación Hondureña de Empresas Pequeñas y\nMedianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days,\nforeshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.\n\nHonduran domestic manufacturers also suffered from increased Central American\ncompetition resulting from a trade liberalization pact signed in May 1991 by\nHonduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Overall, the Honduran manufacturing\nsector has mimicked other sectors of the economy—it is mostly noncompetitive,\neven in a regional context, because of insufficient credit and the high cost\nof inputs. Relatively high interest rates and a complicated investment law\nhave also inhibited the foreign-dominated manufacturing sector from taking\noff.\n\nThe government-sponsored Puerto Cortés Free Zone was opened in 1976. By 1990\nan additional five free zones were in operation in Omoa, Coloma, Tela, La\nCeiba, and Amapala. A series of privately run Export Processing Zones were\nalso established in competition with the government-sponsored free zones.\nThese privately run zones offered the same standard import-export incentives\nas the government zones. Most of the government and privately run zones were\nlocated along the Caribbean coast in a newly developing industrial belt.\n\nFirms operating outside of the special \"enterprise zones\" (either privately\nrun, export-processing zones or government sponsored free zones) enjoy many of\nthe same benefits as those operating within the zones. The Honduran Temporary\nImport Law permits companies that export 100 percent of their production to\ncountries outside the CACM countries to hold ten-year exemptions on corporate\nincome taxes and duty-free import of industrial inputs.\n\nAnalysts continue to debate the actual benefits of the shift away from the\nimport-substitution industrialization (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s\ntoward a new focus on free zones and assembly industries in the 1990s. Critics\npoint to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one\ncountry site or to the creation of permanent infrastructure and employment.\nThey question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs\nin the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of $195 million to the\nHonduran economy from assembly industries in 1991—when the value of clothing\nexports was greater than that of coffee—was a compelling argument in favor of\nthe shift, however."

The\naverage annual growth rate of value added to the economy from the financial\nsector for the 1980s was the second-highest in Latin America, averaging 4\npercent. By 1985 Honduras had twenty-five financial institutions with 300\nbranch offices. Honduran commercial banks held 60 percent of the financial\nsystem's assets in 1985 and nearly 75 percent of all deposits. With the\nexception of the Armed Forces Social Security Institute, all commercial banks\nwere privately owned, and most were owned by Honduran families. In 1985 there\nwere two government-owned development banks in Honduras, one specializing in\nagricultural credit and the other providing financing to municipal\ngovernments.\n\nAt the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank,\nHonduras began a process of financial liberalization in 1990. The process\nbegan with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by\nthe freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran\nbanks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were\nusing their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary\nauthorities and could fix rates within two points of the announced rate.\n\nIn 1991 commercial banks pressured the government to reduce their 35 percent\nminimum reserve ratio. This rate remained standard until June 1993 when the\nminimum requirement was temporarily lifted to 42 percent. The rate was dropped\nto 36 percent three months later. The banks had excess reserves, and lending\nrates were in the area of 26 to 29 percent, with few borrowers. Prior to\nliberalization measures, the Central Bank of Honduras (Banco Central de\nHonduras) maintained interest rate controls, setting a 19 percent ceiling,\nwith the market lending rate hovering around 26 percent in late 1991. With\ninflation hitting 33 percent in 1990, there was, in fact, a negative real\ninterest rate, but this situation reversed in 1991 when rates were high\nrelative to inflation. Rates of 35 to 43 percent in 1993 were well above the\ninflation rate of 13 to 14 percent. Bankers argued for further liberalization,\nincluding easing of controls in the housing and nonexport agricultural\nsectors.\n\nA Honduran stock exchange was established in August 1990 with transactions\nconfined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in\n1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears doubtful, however,\nthat the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms\nto open their books to public scrutiny."

The _Banco Central de Honduras_\n(central bank) named the debilitation of global demand, and loss of dynamism\nin final consumer demand, as important factors in the slowing of Honduras's\neconomic growth in 2008.
