Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( September 2024)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Mongolia** has traditionally been based on agriculture and\nlivestock. Mongolia also has extensive mineral deposits: copper, coal,\nmolybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial\nproduction. Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), disappeared almost overnight in 1990–91, in the time of the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union. Mongolia was driven into deep recession.\n\nEconomic growth picked up in 1997–99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of\nnatural disasters and increases in world prices of copper and cashmere. Public\nrevenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of\nthe 1997 Asian financial crisis. In August and September 1999, the economy\nsuffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products.\nMongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997. The international\ndonor community pledged over $300 million per year in the last Consultative\nGroup Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999. Recently, the Mongolian\neconomy has grown at a fast pace due to an increase in mining and Mongolia\nattained a GDP growth rate of 11.7% in 2013. However, because much of this\ngrowth is export-based, Mongolia is suffering from the global slowdown in\nmining caused by decreased growth in China.",

      "• The historical development of real GDP per capita in Mongolia reflects significant fluctuations influenced by political, economic, and social changes throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.",
      "• During the early 20th century, Mongolia's economy was predominantly agrarian and pastoral, with limited industrialization, resulting in low GDP per capita levels.",
      "• The establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924 marked the beginning of a centrally planned economy, which initially led to modest growth in GDP per capita through state-led industrial and agricultural development.",
      "• From the 1950s to the 1980s, Mongolia experienced steady increases in real GDP per capita due to Soviet aid, investments in mining, infrastructure, and collectivized agriculture, although growth rates were relatively moderate compared to global standards.",
      "• The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 precipitated a severe economic crisis in Mongolia, causing a sharp decline in real GDP per capita as state subsidies and trade links were disrupted.",
      "• The transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented system in the 1990s involved significant economic reforms, including privatization and liberalization, which initially resulted in economic contraction and a decrease in GDP per capita.",
      "• By the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mongolia began to recover economically, with real GDP per capita gradually increasing due to improved macroeconomic policies, foreign investment, and growth in mining exports.",
      "• The discovery and development of large mineral deposits, particularly coal, copper, and gold, in the 2000s significantly boosted Mongolia’s GDP per capita, contributing to rapid economic growth and increased national income.",
      "• Despite this growth, real GDP per capita in Mongolia has remained vulnerable to external shocks such as fluctuations in global commodity prices, harsh climatic conditions affecting agriculture, and political instability.",
      "• Statistical data indicate that Mongolia’s real GDP per capita has increased several-fold since the 1990s, reflecting structural economic transformation and integration into the global economy, although income distribution and poverty remain challenges."

With the\nsharp decrease in metal prices, especially copper (down 65% from July\n2008-February 2009), exports of its raw materials withered and by 2009 the\nstock market MSE Top-20 registered an all-time low since its dramatic spike in\nmid-2007. Just as the economy started to recover, Mongolia was hit by a Zud\nover the winter period of 2009–2010, causing many livestock to perish and thus\nseverely affecting cashmere production which accounts for a further 7% of the\ncountry's export revenues.\n\nAccording to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund estimates, real\nGDP growth reduced from 8% to 2.7% in 2009, and exports shrunk 26% from $2.5Bn\nto $1.9Bn before a promisingly steady increase up until 2008. Because of this,\nit was projected that between 20,000 and 40,000 fewer Mongolians (0.7% and\n1.4% of the population respectively) will be lifted out of poverty, than would\nhave been the case without the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn late 2009 and the beginning of 2010, however, the market has begun to\nrecover once again. Having identified and learnt from its previous economic\ninstabilities, legislative reform and a tightened fiscal policy promises to\nguide the country onwards and upwards. In February 2010, foreign assets were\nrecorded at USD1,569,449 million. New trade agreements are being formed and\nforeign investors are keeping a close eye on the \"Asian Wolf\".\n\nMining is the principal industrial activity in Mongolia, making up 30% of all\nMongolian industry. Another important industry is the production of cashmere.\nMongolia is the world's second largest producer of cashmere, with the main\ncompany, Gobi Cashmere, accounting for 21% of world cashmere production as of\n2006.\n\nTotal export in 2019 was US$7.6 billion.\n\nThe 2022 economic growth is expected to be one percent and international\ninstitutions anticipate the economy to speed up by at least six percent in\n2023 from expanded commodity exports. A significant commodity export boom is\nexpected starting from 2023 with new coal rail networks Error in Webarchive\ntemplate: Empty url. to China coming online and increased copper production\nfrom Rio Tinto’s underground mine Oyu Tolgoi in southern Mongolia.\n\nIn early 2020s, Mongolia's economy, though experiencing growth spurred by\nnatural resource exports, faces challenges.
