It's purchasing power parity (PPP) stood at $216.22\nbillion, which amounts to $33,115 per capita. Their capital city and financial\ncentre is Belgrade, with Novi Sad and Niš being important economic hubs. The\nBelgrade Waterfront is adjacent to the National Bank of Serbia and the\nBelgrade Stock Exchange.\n\nSerbia has a significant industrial and manufacturing base, focused mainly on\nmachinery, automotive manufacturing, energy, and mining. Core exports of the\nSerbian economy include automobiles, base metals, furniture, food processing,\nmachinery, chemicals, tires, clothes, and pharmaceuticals.

    "text": "In the decades leading up to World War I, GDP growth in Serbia grew by 0.28%\nper annum. This was a slower growth rate than Northwestern Europe, leading to\na widening economic divergence between Serbia and Western Europe. Prior to\nWWI, there was extensive growth in Serbia's dominant agricultural sector.\nHowever, industrial and service sectors remained small.\n\nIn the late 1980s, at the beginning of the process of economic transition from\na planned economy to a market economy, Serbia's economy had a favorable\nposition in comparison to most of the Eastern Bloc countries, but it was\ngravely impacted by poor economic decision-making in the 1990s, the Yugoslav\nWars, and UN sanctions and trade embargo during the 1990s. At the same time,\nthe country experienced a serious \"brain drain\". There was a severe recession\nwhich continued until 1999. After the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in 2000,\nSerbia went through a process of transition to a market-based economy and\nexperienced sustained economic growth. During that period, the Serbian economy\ngrew 4-5% annually, average wages quadrupled, and economic and social\nopportunities dramatically improved. During the Great Recession, Serbia marked\na decline in its economy of 3.1% in 2009, and following years of economic\nstagnation pre-crisis level of GDP was reached only in 2016.\n\nSince 2014, the country has been in the process of accession negotiations to\njoin the European Union."

Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key\nfuels (such as oil and gas).\n\nSerbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas.\nSerbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tons of coal lignite are the 5th\nlargest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany). Coal is found in two\nlarge deposits: Kolubara (4 billion tons of reserves) and Kostolac (1.5\nbillion tons). Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas\nresources (77.4 million tons of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic meters,\nrespectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the\nregion of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania). Almost\n90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in Banat and those oil and\ngas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are\naverage on a European scale.\n\nThe production of electricity in 2018 in Serbia was 38.3 billion kilowatt-\nhours (KWh), while the final electricity consumption amounted to 28.1 billion\nkilowatt-hours (KWh). Most of the electricity produced comes from thermal-\npower plants (71% of all electricity) and to a lesser degree from\nhydroelectric-power plants (24%) and wind energy (3%). There are 6 lignite-\noperated thermal-power plants with an installed power of 3,936 MW; largest of\nwhich are 1,502 MW-Nikola Tesla 1 and 1,160 MW-Nikola Tesla 2, both in\nObrenovac. Total installed power of 9 hydroelectric-power plants is 2,831 MW,\nlargest of which is Đerdap 1 with capacity of 1,026 MW. In addition to this,\nthere are mazute and gas-operated thermal-power plants with an installed power\nof 353 MW. The entire production of electricity is concentrated in\nElektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), public electric-utility power company.\n\nThe current oil production in Serbia amounts to over 1.1 million tons of oil\nequivalent and satisfies some 43% of country's needs while the rest is\nimported. National petrol company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), was\nacquired in 2008 by Gazprom Neft. The company's refinery in Pančevo (capacity\nof 4.8 million tons) is one of the most modern oil-refineries in Europe; it\nalso operates network of 334 filling stations in Serbia (74% of domestic\nmarket) and additional 36 stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 31 in Bulgaria,\nand 28 in Romania. There are 155 kilometers of crude oil pipelines connecting\nPančevo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil\npipeline.\n\nSerbia is heavily dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, with only 17%\ncoming from domestic production (totalling 491 million cubic meters in 2012)\nand the rest is imported, mainly from Russia (via gas pipelines that run\nthrough Ukraine and Hungary). Srbijagas, public company, operates the natural\ngas transportation system which comprise 3,177 kilometers of trunk and\nregional natural gas pipelines and a 450 million cubic meter underground gas\nstorage facility at Banatski Dvor."

    "text": "Fixed telephone lines connect 89% of households in Serbia, and with about 8.82\nmillion users the number of cellphones surpasses the total population of\nSerbia by 25%. The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija with 4.06 million\nsubscribers, followed by Yettel Serbia with 2.73 million users and A1 Srbija\nwith about 2.03 million. Some 58% of households have fixed-line (non-mobile)\nbroadband Internet connection while 67% are provided with pay television\nservices (i.e. 38% cable television, 17% IPTV, and 10% satellite). Digital\ntelevision transition has been completed in 2015 with DVB-T2 standard for\nsignal transmission.\n\n205 meters-high Avala Tower, 2010\n\nThe Serbian IT industry is rapidly growing and changing pace. In 2018, IT\nservices exports reached $1.3 billion. With 6,924 companies in the IT sector\n(2013 data[update]), Belgrade is one of the information technology centers in\nthis part of Europe, with strong growth. Microsoft Development Center located\nin Belgrade was at the time of its establishment fifth such center in the\nworld. Many world IT companies choose Belgrade as regional or European center\nsuch as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, NCR, Ubisoft, etc. These companies have\ntaken advantage of Serbia's large pool of engineers and relatively low wages.\n\nLarge investments by global tech companies, such as Microsoft, typical of the\n2000s, are being eclipsed by a growing number of domestic startups which\nobtain funding from domestic and international investors. What brought\ncompanies like Microsoft in the first place was a large pool of talented\nengineers and mathematicians. In just the first quarter of 2016, more than\nUS$65 million has been raised by Serbian startups including $45 million for\nSeven Bridges (a Bioinformatics firm) and $14 million for Vast (a data\nanalysis firm). One of the most successful startups have been Nordeus, which\nwas founded in Belgrade in 2010, and is one of Europe's fastest-growing\ncompanies in the field of video games (the developer of Top Eleven Football\nManager; a game played by over 20 million people)."

    "text": "The touristic sector accounted for 1.4% of GDP in 2017 and employs some 75,000\npeople, about 3% of the country's workforce. Foreign exchange earnings from\ntourism in 2018 were estimated at $1.5 billion.\n\nSerbia is not a mass-tourism destination but nevertheless has a diverse range\nof touristic products. In 2018, total of over 3.4 million tourists were\nrecorded in accommodations, of which half were foreign.\n\nTourism is mainly focused on the mountains and spas of the country, which are\nmostly visited by domestic tourists, as well as Belgrade which is preferred\nchoice of foreign tourists. The most famous mountain resorts are Kopaonik,\nStara Planina, and Zlatibor. There are also many spas in Serbia, the biggest\nof which is Vrnjačka Banja, Soko Banja, and Banja Koviljača. City-break and\nconference tourism is developed in Belgrade (which was visited by 938,448\nforeign tourists in 2018, more than a half of all international visits to the\ncountry) and to a lesser degree Novi Sad. Other touristic products that Serbia\noffer are natural wonders like Đavolja varoš, Christian pilgrimage to the many\nOrthodox monasteries across the country and the river cruising along the\nDanube. There are several internationally popular music festivals held in\nSerbia, such as EXIT (with 25–30,000 foreign visitors coming from 60\ncountries) and the Guča trumpet festival."

    "text": "Serbia has a strategic transportation location since the country's backbone,\nMorava Valley, represents by far the easiest route of land travel from\ncontinental Europe to Asia Minor and the Near East.\n\nSerbian road network carries the bulk of traffic in the country. Total length\nof roads is 45,419 km of which 915 km are \"class-Ia state roads\" (i.e.\nmotorways); 4,481 km are \"class-Ib state roads\" (national roads); 10,941 km\nare \"class-II state roads\" (regional roads) and 23,780 km are \"municipal\nroads\". The road network, except for the most of class-Ia roads, are of\ncomparatively high quality to the Western European standards because of huge\nfinancial investments Serbias has been seeing in the last 10 years.\n\nOver 300 kilometers of new motorways has been constructed in the last decade\nand additional 142 kilometers are currently under construction: A5 motorway\n(from north of Kruševac to Čačak) and 30 km-long segment of A2 (between Čačak\nand Požega). Coach transport is very extensive: almost every place in the\ncountry is connected by bus, from largest cities to the villages; in addition\nthere are international routes (mainly to countries of Western Europe with\nsmall Serb diaspora). Routes, both domestic and international, are served by\nmore than 100 bus companies, biggest of which are Lasta and Niš-Ekspres. As of\n2018[update], there were 1,959,584 registered passenger cars or 1 passenger\ncar per 3.5 inhabitants.\n\nSerbia has 3,819 kilometers of rail tracks, of which 1,279 are electrified and\n283 kilometers are double-track railroad. The major rail hub is Belgrade (and\nto a lesser degree Niš), while the most important railroads include:\nBelgrade–Bar (Montenegro), Belgrade–Šid–Zagreb (Croatia)/Belgrade–Niš–Sofia\n(Bulgaria) (part of Pan-European Corridor X), Belgrade–Subotica–Budapest\n(Hungary) and Niš–Thessaloniki (Greece). Although still a major mode of\nfreight transportation, railroads face increasing problems with the\nmaintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds. The rail services are\noperated by Srbija Voz (passenger transport) and Srbija Kargo (freight\ntransport).\n\nThere are three airports with regular passenger traffic. Belgrade Nikola Tesla\nAirport served 5.6 million passengers in 2018 and is a hub of flagship carrier\nAir Serbia which carried some 2.5 million passengers in 2018. Niš Constantine\nthe Great Airport is mainly catering low-cost airlines. Morava Airport is\ncurrently only served by Air Serbia.\n\nSerbia has a developed inland water transport since there are 1,716 kilometers\nof navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of\nnavigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the\ncountry. The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-\nEuropean Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and\nTimiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe\nthrough the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Central Europe via\nthe Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the\nSava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian\nrivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad,\nBelgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac."

The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-\nsocialist era, reaching its peak at 25.9% in 2012. Since then, the rate has\ndecreased substantially, with the creation of new jobs in primarily private\nsector, reaching 9.8% in 2021.\n\n10,2%\n\n4%\n\n12%\n\n10,7%\n\n8,1\n\n9,9%\n\n11,3%\n\n8,8%\n\n12%\n\n4,7%\n\n14,1%\n\n13,4%\n\n16,6%\n\n15%\n\n14,8%\n\n20,1%\n\n9,6%\n\n7,1%\n\n21,3%\n\n13,8%\n\n11,2%\n\n10,4%\n\n12%\n\n13,4%\n\n15,6%\n\nNote: districts in purple on the map had unemployment rate in 2021 - below\n10%, blue in the range of 10% – 15%, orange in the range of 15% – 20%; and red\n– 20% and over.\n\nAccording to the latest monthly report of the Statistical Office of the\nRepublic of Serbia, the average monthly salary in January 2022 amounted to\n120,085 Serbian dinars (1,022 euros) gross or 85,422 Serbian dinars (727\neuros) net. The median salary amounted to 85,422 Serbian dinars (727 euros)\ngross or 64,860 (552 euros) net, which means that 50% of the employees had\nearned a salary up to that amount.\n\nThe employer is also liable to pay for additional social security\ncontributions which brings the total labour cost for the average salary to\n150,107 Serbian dinars (1,280 euros), thus the total tax ratio amounts to\n26.9%. The map below shows average salaries by region in December 2022,\nexpressed in gross terms in order to make the data comparable to the data that\nis published by Eurostat. Due to the nature of Serbia's economy, the majority\nof people working in Serbia work under the so-called \"entrepreneurship\"\nsalary. This category of worker is seen in local markets, for examples,\nplumbers, and a variety of occupations. The majority of people working in the\nIT are also entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs' tax contribution will not exceed\nthe maximum amount of 10% of their salary. The average tax contribution is\nfrom €80 to €250 a month (depending on the location registered in Serbia),\nwhich is between 0.0042% to 2% of tax when compared to the max amount of\nincome allowed under the entrepreneurship bracket. This makes Serbia one of\nthe best countries for entrepreneurship in Europe, with lowest income tax rate\nin Europe.\n\n€1070\n\n€1105\n\n€1046\n\n€1129\n\n€1337\n\n€1126\n\n€1195\n\n€1573\n\n€1057\n\n€1122\n\n€1357\n\n€1130\n\n€1389\n\n€1140\n\n€1021\n\n€1074\n\n€1073\n\n€1087\n\n€1016\n\n€1054\n\n€1159\n\n€997\n\n€1080\n\n€960\n\n€974\n\nNote: districts in purple on the map had gross average monthly salary in\nJanuary 2025 – €1300 and over, blue in the range of €1100 – €1299; orange in\nthe range of €1000 – €1099, and red – below €1000."
