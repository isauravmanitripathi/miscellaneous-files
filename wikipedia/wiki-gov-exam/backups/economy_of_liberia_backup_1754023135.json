    "text": "Much of independent Liberia's economic history is subject to limited archival\ndocumentation, making it hard for economic historians to make comprehensive\nassessments about the nature of Liberia's economy over time. The Liberian\ngovernment only began producing GDP per capita data in 1964.\n\nA 2022 study by LSE economic historian Leigh A. Gardner assessed that Liberian\nGDP per capita was $430 in 1845, which was just above subsistence and\napproximately half of Japan's GDP per capita at the time. It rose to\napproximately $500 by the time of independence, but the economy subsequently\nstagnated until the 1930s when a period of rapid economic growth began.\nWhereas Liberia had been poorer than Ghana during the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, it caught up with Ghana in 1950 and subsequently diverged\nconsiderably, becoming almost twice as wealthy as Ghana by 1970. Throughout\nthe 1970s, the Liberian economy stagnated.\n\nIn 1926, the Liberian government gave the Firestone Tire company the right to\nlease up to 1 million acres of land for 99 years at a cost of 6 cents per\nacre. Firestone developed an inordinate sway over the Liberian government,\neffectively acquiring control over its finances in the subsequent period. The\ncompany was an important source of foreign investment into Liberia during this\nperiod. Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the\nnon-native South American rubber tree, _Hevea brasiliensis_ in the country. By\nthe 1950s, the company was Liberia's largest private employer and also its\nlargest exporter. Vincent Browne wrote in 1955 that rubber accounted for more\nthan $45,000,000 of Liberia's approximately $55,000,000 worth of exports.\nLiberia became one of the largest rubber exporters in the world in the post-\nWorld War II period. Today, Firestone's rubber plantation in Liberia is the\nworld's largest contiguous rubber plantation, operated by the Firestone (now\nBridgestone) subsidiary, the Firestone Natural Rubber Company.\n\nIn the 1940s, Liberia become one of the largest recipients of American aid. US\naid to Liberia began with the Lend-Lease program of 1942. The aid per capita\nreceived by Liberia was comparable to that obtained by countries such as Korea\nand Marshall Aid recipients like the United Kingdom. Economic historian George\nDalton estimated in 1965 that Liberia received more aid per capita from the\nUnited States than any other African country.\n\nIn the post-WWII period, Liberia tried to become a destination for offshore\nservices, as the country loosened laws related to ship registration,\ncorporation, and taxes. The Liberian shipping registry was highly successful\nas Liberia had by the 1960s become the largest ship registry in the world in\nterms of tonnage.\n\nThe Liberian economy had relied heavily on the mining of iron ore prior to the\ncivil war. Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. By\nthe 1970s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export\nearnings. Since the coup d'état of 1980, the country's economic growth rate\nhas slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world\nmarket and political upheavals in Liberia.\n\nUpon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate again,\nreaching a peak of 9.4% in 2007. In 2009, during the Great Recession GDP\ngrowth slowed to 4.6%, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by\nrubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected\n7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.\n\nIn March 2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the first hotel constructed\nin Liberia in 20 years. The 13-acre (53,000 m2) luxury resort was built in the\nPaynesville section of Monrovia.\n\nLiberia's external debt was estimated in 2006 at approximately $4.5 billion,\n800% of GDP. As a result of bilateral, multilateral and commercial debt relief\nfrom 2007 to 2010, the country's external debt fell to $222.9 million by 2011.",
