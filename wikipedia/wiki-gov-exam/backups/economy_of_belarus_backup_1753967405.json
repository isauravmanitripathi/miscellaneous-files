    "text": "Before the October Revolution, Belarus was a relatively backward and\nunderdeveloped country, heavily reliant on agriculture and with rural\noverpopulation, although it experienced a rapid economic and industrial growth\nafter the construction of railways in the late 19th century (with Minsk,\nVitsebsk, Hrodna, Pinsk and Homel becoming significant industrial centres. The\nSecond World War devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its\npopulation and suffered immense destruction of infrastructure. In the post-war\nyears, Belarus rapidly industrialised and became an important trade hub\nbetween the Soviet Union and Europe. Manufacturing became a pillar of its\neconomy emphasising tractors, heavy trucks, oil processing, metal-cutting\nlathes, synthetic fibres, TV sets, semi-conductors and microchips. In the\n1980s, more than half of the industrial personnel of Belarus worked for\nenterprises with over 500 employees. Among the Soviet republics, it had an\nunusually high export rate of its products, about 80%, and was the most\ntechnologically advanced. Because of its role as a producer of products made\nfrom raw materials imported from the Soviet Union, Belarus was called \"the\nSoviet assembly shop\".\n\nSince the disintegration of the Soviet Union and under Lukashenko's\nleadership, Belarus has maintained government control over key industries and\neschewed the large-scale privatizations seen in other former Soviet republics.\n\nThe period between 1996 and 2000 was also characterised by significant\nfinancial distress, in particular in 1998 and 1999 as a result of the\nfinancial and economic crisis in Russia. This resulted primarily in a sharp\nincrease in prices and the devaluation of the national currency, a decline in\ntrade with Russia and other CIS countries, growth in inter-enterprise arrears,\nand overall deterioration of the country's balance of payments. Extreme\ntension within the foreign exchange market was the key factor that\ndestabilized the economy in 1998 and 1999. In 1999, consumer prices grew by\n294%.[_citation needed_]\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the national economy demonstrated steady and dynamic\ngrowth. The GDP grew at an average rate of 7.4 percent, peaking in 2005 at 9.2\npercent. This growth was mainly a result of the performance of the industrial\nsector, which grew on average more than 8.7 percent per year, with a high of\n10.4 percent in 2005. Potatoes, flax, hemp, sugarbeets, rye, oats, and wheat\nare the chief agricultural products. Dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and chickens\nare raised. Belarus has only small reserves of petroleum and natural gas and\nimports most of its oil and gas from Russia. The main branches of industry\nproduce tractors and trucks, earth movers for use in construction and mining,\nmetal-cutting machine tools, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, chemicals,\nfertilizer, textiles, and consumer goods. The chief trading partners are\nRussia, Ukraine, Poland, and Germany.\n\nThe Belarus GDP grew 9.9% in 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, GDP grew\n8.2%. GDP further grew in 2008 by 10%.\n\nAnalysis of foreign direct investment to Belarus between 2002 and 2007 shows\nthat nearly 80% of FDI was geared into the service sector, while industrial\nconcerns accounted for 20%. Agricultural FDI was negligible at 1%.",

    "text": "Shortly before the 2010 presidential election, average salaries in Belarus\nwere increased by the government to $500 per month. It is believed to be one\nof the main reasons for the crisis in 2011. Other reasons for the crisis were\nstrong governmental control in the economy, a discount rate lower than\ninflation and the budget deficit.\n\nIn January 2011, Belarusians started to convert their savings from Belarusian\nrubles to dollars and euros. The situation was influenced by rumors of\npossible devaluation of the ruble. Exchange rates in Belarus are centralized\nby the government-controlled National Bank of Belarus. The National Bank was\nforced to spend $1 billion of the foreign reserves to balance the supply and\ndemand of currency On March 22, it stopped the support to banks. The National\nBank also didn't change the exchange rate significantly (3,000 BYR per dollar\non January 1 and 3,045 BYR on April 1), so the increased demand of dollars and\neuro exhausted cash reserves of banks. In April and May 2011, many people had\nto wait for several days in queues to buy dollars in the exchange booths. In\nApril, Belarusian banks were given informal permission of government to\nincrease the exchange rate to 4,000 BYR for 1 dollar (later 4,500 BYR), but\nfew people started to sell dollars and euro. On May 24, the ruble was\nofficially devalued by 36% (from 3,155 to 4,931 BYR per 1 dollar). But the\nshortage of the currency retained. As a result of the shortage, a black market\nof currency was created. In July 2011, the black market exchange rate was\nnearly 6,350 BYR per 1 dollar, in August, it reached 9,000 BYR per 1 dollar.\n\nIn September 2011, National Bank of Belarus introduced a free exchange market\nsession to determine a market value of the ruble. From November 2011 to March\n2012, the exchange rate was Br 8,000—8,150 per dollar, but it started to rise\nin April 2012 and reached Br 8,360 per dollar on 10 July 2012.\n\nRecovery from the crisis was difficult due to isolation of the Belarusian\ngovernment from the EU and US.\n\nThe crisis strongly affected the economy. Inflation reached 108.7% in 2011.\nAverage salary (counted in dollars) decreased from $530 in December 2010 to\n$330 in May 2011. In May 2012, the average salary reached $436 (3,559,600 with\n8,165 per dollar). Refinancing rate (analogue of discount rate) rose from\n10.5% in December 2010 to 45% in December 2011 and fell to 32% in June 2012.\nIn November 2011, interest rates of several banks reached 120% in rubles.",

    "text": "A number of state-owned Belarusian companies were sanctioned by the EU, USA,\nUK, Canada following 2006, 2010, 2012 and 2020 elections. In 2020 and 2021,\nthe EU imposed sanctions on several companies, including MAZ, MZKT, BelAZ\n(automotive industry), Dana Holdings real estate company, trading companies\nBremino Group, Sohra, Logex, Globalcastcom Management, NNK, and other\ncompanies. On 24 June 2021, the EU introduced the sectoral sanctions that\naffected petroleum and fertilizer production, tobacco industry, supply of\ndual-purpose equipment, and access to the EU financial markets by the\nBelarusian government. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on\nBelneftekhim concern and its subordinated companies. They were later\nsuspended, but not cancelled. In 2021, USA renewed them and imposed new\nsanctions on several companies. In 2021, UK and Canada imposed similar\nsanctions on several companies.\n\nIn 2020–2021, Belarusian authorities made different efforts to circumvent the\nWestern sanctions. They also hid the statistics to prevent revealing the ways\nused to circumvent them and track their effects. In particular, access to data\nregarding production and exports of the sanctioned goods became restricted to\npublic. In October 2021, Belstat started to hide data regarding exports of\ntractors and trucks. Overall classified exports in January–August 2021 is\nestimated at US$8.2 billion. In September 2021, Alexander Lukashenko mentioned\nminister of industry Petr Parkhomchik [ru] and vice prime minister Yuri\nNazarov (politician) [ru] as the people who organized the circumvention of\nsanctions. He also accused several workers of state factories of gathering\ninformation about the ways used to circumvent the sanctions, and he threatened\nthem with imprisonment. 13 workers from Grodno Azot fertilizer factory, Naftan\noil refinery, BMZ steel mill and Belarusian Railway were arrested by the\nBelarusian KGB in a possible connection with this statement. It was reported\nthat some of them were accused of state treason. At least two of them were\nlater released. In June 2021, Belorusneft was removed from subordination of\nBelneftekhim. This move was believed to be connected with the sanctions."
