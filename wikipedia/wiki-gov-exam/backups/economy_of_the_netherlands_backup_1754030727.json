OECD, 2012 Part-time employment rate (%) in OECD\ncountries. The Netherlands has the highest rate.\n\nThe **economy of the Netherlands** is a highly developed market economy\nfocused on trade and logistics, manufacturing, services, innovation and\ntechnology and sustainable and renewable energy. It is the world's 18th\nlargest economy by nominal GDP and the 28th largest by purchasing power parity\n(PPP) and is the fifth largest economy in European Union by nominal GDP. It\nhas the world's 11th highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the 13th highest per\ncapita GDP (PPP) as of 2023 making it one of the highest earning nations in\nthe world. Many of the world's largest tech companies are based in its capital\nAmsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as\nIBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Cisco, Uber and Netflix. Its second largest\ncity Rotterdam is a major trade, logistics and economic center of the world\nand is Europe's largest seaport. Netherlands is ranked fifth on global\ninnovation index and fourth on the Global Competitiveness Report. Among OECD\nnations, Netherlands has a highly efficient and strong social security system;\nsocial expenditure stood at roughly 25.3% of GDP.\n\nThe Netherlands has a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on\nforeign trade. The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly\nlow unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus (which,\ncompared to the size of the country, is even more than Germany) and an\nimportant role as a European transportation hub; Rotterdam is the biggest port\nin Europe; and Amsterdam has one of the biggest airports in the world.\nIndustrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum\nrefining, high-tech, financial services, the creative sector and electrical\nmachinery. Its highly mechanized agricultural sector employs no more than 2%\nof the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing\nindustry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners,\nbegan circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002.\n\nThe Netherlands has had steady natural gas resources since 1959, when a\nwellspring was discovered. Currently the Netherlands accounts for more than\n25% of all natural gas reserves in the European Union. Over the following\ndecades, the sale of natural gas generated a significant rise in revenue for\nthe Netherlands. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's energy\nwealth originally impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the\neconomy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease, after the discovery of the\nvast Groningen gas field.\n\nThe Netherlands is a \"conduit country\" that helps to funnel profits from high-\ntax countries to tax havens. It has been ranked as the 7th largest tax haven\nin the World.\n\nThe stern financial was abandoned in 2009, because of the then-current credit\ncrises. The relatively large banking sector was partly nationalized and bailed\nout through government interventions. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.0% in\nthe summer of 2011, but increased with a sharp rate to 7.3% in May 2013, and\n6.8% in 2015. It dropped again to 3.9% in March 2018. The state budget deficit\nwas about 2.2% in 2015, well below the norm of 3.0% in the EU. In 2016, the\nstate budget showed a surplus of 0.4%. It was expected to grow to a surplus of\nover 1.0% in 2017. Historically, the Dutch introduced and invented the stock\nmarket, which initially focused on merchandise trading through the Dutch East\nIndia Company. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, the\nOECD and the World Trade Organization.",

    "text": "After declaring its independence from the empire of Philip II of Spain in\n1581, the Netherlands experienced almost a century of explosive economic\ngrowth. A technological revolution in capital, due to Protestant traders of\nFlanders who fled to the Netherlands, helped the young Republic become the\ndominant trade power by the mid-17th century. In 1670 the Dutch merchant\nmarine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping—about half the European total. The\nmain reasons for this were the dominance of the Amsterdam Entrepôt in European\ntrade, and that of the Dutch East India Company (or Verenigde Oost-Indische\nCompanie – VOC) and West India Companies in intercontinental trade. These\ncompanies were based on the English model and the success of England's joint-\nstock enterprises and trading guilds.\n\nBeside trade, an early \"industrial revolution\" (powered by wind, water and\npeat), land reclamation from the sea, and agricultural revolution, helped the\nDutch economy achieve the highest standard of living in Europe (and presumably\nthe world) by the middle of the 17th century. Affluence facilitated what is\nknown as the Dutch Golden Age. This economic boom abruptly came to an end by a\ncombination of political-military upheavals and adverse economic developments\naround 1670. Still the Netherlands kept a high level of prosperity, due to\ntrade and agriculture.\n\nTowards the 1800s, the Netherlands did not industrialize as rapidly as some\nother countries in Europe. One explanation for this is that the Netherlands\nwere struggling to come to terms with having lost their dominant economical\n(based mainly on trade and agriculture) and political position in the world.\nGriffiths argues that government policies made possible a unified Dutch\nnational economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal\ntariffs and guilds; a unified coinage system; modern methods of tax\ncollection; standardized weights and measures; and the building of many roads,\ncanals, and railroads.\n\nThe rest of Europe in the 19th century saw the gradual transformation of the\nNetherlands into a modern middle-class industrial society. The number of\npeople employed in agriculture decreased while the country made an effort to\nrevive its stake in the highly competitive industrial and trade business. The\nNetherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in\nindustrialization, then caught up by about 1920. Major industries included\ntextiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam\nbecame a major shipping and manufacturing center. Poverty slowly declined and\nbegging largely disappeared along with steadily improving working conditions\nfor the population.\n\nIn 1959, the Netherlands discovered large natural gas fields. The export of\nnatural gas led to large windfall profits. However, as an unforeseen\nconsequence, these were believed to have led to a decline in the manufacturing\nsector in the Netherlands.",
