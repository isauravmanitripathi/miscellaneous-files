    "text": "Sri Lanka has a long history as a trading hub as a result of being located at\nthe centre of east–west trade and irrigated agriculture in the hinterland,\nwhich is known from historical texts surviving within the island and from\naccounts of foreign travellers. The island has irrigation reservoirs called\ntanks built by ancient Kings starting after Indo-Aryan migration, many of\nwhich survive to this day. They form part of an irrigation system interlinked\nwith more modern constructions.\n\nFaxian (also Fa Hsien) a Chinese Monk who travelled to India and Sri Lanka\naround 400 AD, writes of existing legends at his time of merchants from other\ncountries trading with native tribal peoples in the island before Indo-Aryan\nsettlement. \"The country which originally had no human inhabitants but was\noccupied by spirits and nagas (serpent worshipers) with which merchants of\nvarious countries carried on a trade,\" Faxian wrote in 'A Record of Buddhistic\nKingdoms'. He writes of precious stones and pearl fisheries with a 30% tax by\nthe king.\n\nThe monk had embarked \"in a large merchant vessel\" from India to arrive in the\nisland. To go back to China he \"took passage in a large merchantman on board\nwhich were more than 200 men\", ran into a storm where the merchants were\nforced to throw part of the cargo overboard and arrived at Java-dvipa\n(Indonesia), showing Sri Lanka had active coastal and long-distance maritime\ntrade links.\n\nCosmas Indicopleustes (Indian Voyager), a merchant/monk from Alexandria of\nEgypt, who visited the Indian sub-continent in the 6th century, wrote in\ndetail about Sri Lanka as a centre of commerce, referring to the island as\nTaprobane and Sieladiba.\n\n\"The island being, as it is, in a central position, is much frequented by\nships from all parts of India and from Persia and Ethiopia, and it likewise\nsends out many of its own,\" he wrote in Christian Topography. \"And from the\nremotest countries, I mean Tzinista [China] and other trading places, it\nreceives silk, aloes, cloves, sandalwood and other products, and these again\nare passed on to marts on this side, such as Male [Malabar or South West\nIndian coast] ... and to Calliana [Kalyana]... This same Sielediba then,\nplaced as one may say, in the centre of the Indies and possessing the hyacinth\n[sapphire] receives ... and in turn exports to them, and is thus itself a\ngreat seat of commerce.\"",

      "• Faxian (also spelled Fa Hsien), a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India and Sri Lanka around 400 AD, documented existing legends of pre-Indo-Aryan trade between foreign merchants and native tribal peoples on the island, describing it as originally uninhabited except for spirits and naga serpent worshipers engaged in commerce.",
      "• According to Faxian’s work, 'A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms,' Sri Lanka was known for its precious stones and pearl fisheries, which were subject to a 30% tax imposed by the king.",
      "• Faxian traveled to Sri Lanka aboard a large merchant vessel from India and returned to China on a merchant ship carrying over 200 men; during the return voyage, the ship encountered a storm, forcing merchants to jettison cargo before arriving at Java-dvipa (modern Indonesia), demonstrating Sri Lanka’s active participation in both coastal and long-distance maritime trade networks.",
      "• Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century merchant and monk from Alexandria, Egypt, who visited the Indian subcontinent, referred to Sri Lanka as Taprobane and Sieladiba in his work 'Christian Topography,' highlighting the island’s prominence as a commercial center.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka was ahead of many Asian nations and had economic and social\nindicators comparable to Japan when they gained independence from the British\nin 1948.\n\nSri Lanka's social indicators were considered \"exceptionally high\". Literacy\nwas already 21.7% by the late 19th century. A Malaria eradication policy of\n1946 had cut the death rate from 20 per thousand in 1946 to 14 by 1947. Life\nexpectancy at birth of a Sri Lankan in 1948 at 54 years was just under Japan's\n57.5 years. Sri Lanka's infant mortality rate in 1950 was 82 deaths per\nthousand live births, Malaysia 91 and Philippines 102.\n\nWith its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka was expected to\nhave a better chance than most other Asian neighbours to register a rapid\neconomic take-off and had \"appeared to be one of the most promising new\nnations.\" But the optimism in 1948 had dimmed by 1960, due to wrong economic\npolicies and mismanagement.\n\nEast Asia was gradually overtaking Sri Lanka. In 1950 Sri Lanka's un-adjusted\nschool enrolment ratio as a share of the 5-19 year age group was 54%, India\n19%, Korea 43% and the Philippines 59%. But by 1979 Sri Lanka's school\nenrollment rate was 74%, but the Philippines had improved to 85% and Korea was\n94%.\n\nSri Lanka had inherited a stable macro-economy at independence. A central bank\nwas set up and Sri Lanka became a member of the IMF entering the Bretton Woods\nsystem of currency pegs on August 29, 1950. By 1953 exchange controls were\ntightened with a new law.\n\nThe economy was then progressively controlled and relaxed in response to\nforeign exchange crises as monetary and fiscal policies deteriorated. Controls\nand restrictions in 1961-64 were followed by partial liberalization in\n1965–70. Controls were continued after a devaluation in the wake of 1967\nSterling Crisis. Controls were tightened from 1970 to 1977 alongside the\ncollapse of the Bretton Woods system. \"In sum it was a story of tightening\npartial relaxing, and again tightening the trade regime and associated areas\nto over a perceived foreign exchange crisis,\" writes economist Saman Kelegama\nin 'Development in Independent Sri Lanka what went wrong'. \"In the early 1960s\nstrategy for dealing with the foreign exchange crisis was the gradual\nisolation of the economy from external market forces. It was the beginning of\na standard import-substitution industrial regime with all the controls and\nrestrictions associated with such a regime. Expropriation and state\nintervention in economic activities was common.\"\n\nIn 1960 Sri Lanka's (then Ceylon) per capita GDP was 152 dollars, Korea 153,\nMalaysia 280, Thailand 95, Indonesia 62, Philippines 254, Taiwan 149. But by\n1978 Sri Lanka's per capita GDP was 226, Malaysia's 588, Indonesia's 370 and\nTaiwan's 505.\n\nThe 1970s also saw an uprising in the south from the JVP insurrection, and the\nroots of a civil war in the North and the East."

    "text": "In 1977, Colombo abandoned statist economic policies and its import\nsubstitution industrialisation policy for market-oriented policies and export-\noriented trade. Sri Lanka would after that be known to handle dynamic\nindustries such as food processing, textiles and apparel, food and beverages,\ntelecommunications, and insurance and banking. In the 1970s, the share of the\nmiddle class increased.\n\nBetween 1977 and 1994 the country came under UNP rule in which under President\nJ.R Jayawardana Sri Lanka began to shift away from a socialist orientation in\n1977. Since then, the government has been deregulating, privatizing, and\nopening the economy to international competition. In 2001, Sri Lanka faced\nbankruptcy, with debt reaching 101% of GDP. The impending currency crisis was\naverted after the country reached a hasty ceasefire agreement with the LTTE\nand brokered substantial foreign loans. After 2004 the UPFA government has\nconcentrated on the mass production of goods for domestic consumption such as\nrice, grain and other agricultural products. however twenty-five years of\ncivil war slowed economic growth,[_citation needed_] diversification and\nliberalisation, and the political group Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)\nuprisings, especially the second in the early 1980s, also caused extensive\nupheavals.\n\nFollowing the quelling of the JVP insurrection, increased privatization,\neconomic reform and the stress on export-oriented growth helped improve\neconomic performance, increasing GDP growth to 7% in 1993. By 1996 plantation\ncrops made up only 20% of exports (compared with 93% in 1970), while textiles\nand garments accounted for 63%. GDP grew at an annual average rate of 5.5%\nthroughout the 1990s until a drought and a deteriorating security situation\nlowered growth to 3.8% in 1996.\n\nThe economy rebounded in 1997–98 with a growth of 6.4% and 4.7% – but slowed\nto 3.7% in 1999. For the next round of reforms, the central bank of Sri Lanka\nrecommends that Colombo expand market mechanisms in nonplantation agriculture,\ndismantle the government's monopoly on wheat imports, and promote more\ncompetition in the financial sector. Economic growth has been uneven in the\nensuing years as the economy faced a multitude of global and domestic economic\nand political challenges. Overall, average annual GDP growth was 5.2% over\n1991–2000.\n\nIn 2001, however, GDP growth was negative 1.4% – the first contraction since\nindependence. The economy was hit by a series of global and domestic economic\nproblems and was affected by terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and the United\nStates. The crises also exposed the fundamental policy failures and structural\nimbalances in the economy and the need for reforms. The year ended in\nparliamentary elections in December, which saw the election of United National\nParty to Parliament, while Sri Lanka Freedom Party retained the presidency.\n\nDuring the short-lived peace process from 2002 to 2004, the economy benefited\nfrom lower interest rates, a recovery in domestic demand, increased tourist\narrivals, a revival of the stock exchange, and increased foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI). In 2002, the economy experienced a gradual recovery. During\nthis period Sri Lanka has been able to reduce defense expenditures and begin\nto focus on getting its large, public sector debt under control. In 2002,\neconomic growth reached 4%, aided by strong service sector growth. The\nagricultural sector of the economy staged a partial recovery. Total FDI\ninflows during 2002 were about $246 million.\n\nThe Mahinda Rajapakse government halted the privatization process and launched\nseveral new companies as well as re-nationalising previous state-owned\nenterprises, one of which the courts declared that privatization is null and\nvoid. Some state-owned corporations became overstaffed and less efficient,\nmaking huge losses with series of frauds being uncovered in them and nepotism\nrising. During this time, the EU revoked GSP plus preferential tariffs from\nSri Lanka due to alleged human rights violations, which cost about US$500\nmillion a year.\n\nThe resumption of the civil war in 2005 led to a steep increase in defence\nexpenditures. The increased violence and lawlessness also prompted some donor\ncountries to cut back on aid to the country.\n\nA sharp rise in world petroleum prices combined with the economic fallout from\nthe civil war led to inflation that peaked at 20%.[_citation needed_]"

The creation of several business and\ntechnology development areas island-wide specialised in various sectors, as\nwell as tourism zones, are also being planned. In the mid to late 2010s, Sri\nLanka faced a danger of falling into economic malaise, with increasing debt\nlevels and a political crisis which saw the country's debt rating being\ndropped. In 2016 the government succeeded in lifting an EU ban on Sri Lankan\nfish products which resulted in fish exports to EU rising by 200% and in 2017\nimproving human rights conditions resulted in the European Commission\nproposing to restore GSP plus facility to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's tax revenues\nper GDP also increased from 10% in 2014, which was the lowest in nearly two\ndecades to 12.3% in 2015. Despite reforms, Sri Lanka was listed among\ncountries with the highest risk for investors by Bloomberg. Growth also\nfurther slowed to 3.3% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019. The rupee fell from 131 to\nthe US dollar to 182 from 2015 to 2019, inflating foreign debt and slowing\ndomestic consumption ending a period of relative stability. China became a top\ncreditor to Sri Lanka over the last decade, overtaking Japan and the World\nBank.\n\nThe main economic sectors of the country are tourism, tea export, apparel,\ntextile, rice production and other agricultural products. In addition to these\neconomic sectors, overseas employment contributes highly to foreign exchange.\n\nSri Lanka bonds spiked in 2022\nInverted yield curve in the first half of 2022\n\n15 year bonds\n\n10 year bonds\n\n5 year bonds\n\n1 year bonds\n\n6 month bonds\n\nUSD / Sri Lankan Rupee exchange rate.\nIn early March 2022, the Sri Lankan Rupee began losing value quickly.\n\nAs of the early 2020s, the debt-laden country is undergoing an economic crisis\nwhere locals are experiencing months of shortages of food, fuel and\nelectricity. Inflation has peaked at 57% according to official data. In April\n2022, Sri Lanka declared a sovereign default.

    "text": "**Budget deficit 2019: -6.8%/9.4%, 2020:11.1%/14%, 2021f: -9.4%**\n\nSri Lanka is expecting a budget deficit of 9.4% of GDP in 2021 after the\nnominal output for the year was revised down following a Coronavirus pandemic\nin 2020. A budget submitted to parliament originally expected a deficit of\n8.9% in 2021 with a Coronavirus pandemic slowing growth, compounded by tax\ncuts. Concerns were raised that the targets were too ambitious given\nCoronavirus pandemic uncertainties as well as global economic weakness with\nFitch Ratings projecting a deficit of 11.5%.\n\nThe Finance Ministry has countered saying a lower interest bill, a gradual\nrecovery in 2021, and stronger foreign direct investments to the Port City\nwill strengthen economic activity and state finances. The Treasury also hopes\nto borrow more domestically instead of from abroad.\n\nSri Lanka's national debt has been gradually rising amid weak growth and\npolicy gridlock. Following the steep rise in the deficit in 2020, central\ngovernment debt rose to 101% of GDP. The debt to GDP ratio rose to 86.8% in\n2019 from 77.9% in 2017.\n\n**Budget deficit data controversy**\n\nSri Lanka's Ministry of Finance in 2020 changed its cash-basis accounting\nconvention and charged some payment arrears to the previous year, reporting an\n11.1% of GDP deficit for 2020 and revising up the 6.8 deficit in 2019 to 9.6%.\nSri Lanka's main opposition charged that it was accounting fraud since arrears\nare always charged to the year it was paid under the country's cash-basis\naccounting convention. The deficit that was financed in 2020 was 14.0% of GDP.\nA Sri Lanka-based fact-checking portal, FactCheck.lk said the shift in numbers\nto 2019 \"cannot be validated by an accounting standard.\"\n\n**Credit rating and commercial borrowing**\n\nSri Lanka applied for credit ratings from international agencies in its\nefforts to apply for loans from international markets in 2005 after the\nelection of Mahinda Rajapakse as president. Standard and Poor's gave Sri Lanka\na \"B+\" speculative rating, four levels below investment grade and Fitch \"BB−\",\nthree grades below investment grade. Standard and Poor's maintained Sri Lanka\nwas constrained by providing widespread subsidies, a bloated public sector,\ntransfers to loss-making state enterprises, and high interest local and\ninternational burdens [1]. Standard and Poor's estimates public sector debt\nhas reached 95% of GDP [2], in comparison to CIA estimates of 89% of GDP [3].\nSri Lanka in mid-2007 sought to borrow $500 million from international markets\nto shore up the deteriorating exchange rate and reduce pressure on repayment\nof the domestic debt market [4]. The head of the opposition UNP, Ranil\nWickremasinghe has warned that such intense borrowing is unsustainable and\nwill not repay these loans if elected to power [5]. Sri Lanka's credit rating\nwas progressively downgraded following a series of currency crises and output\nshocks. In December 2018 Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka to 'B' and in April 2020\nto 'B−' amid a global Coronavirus pandemic. Moody's downgraded Sri Lanka to\nCaa1 in September 2020, which was disputed by the Finance Ministry. In\nNovember 2020, Fitch Ratings also downgraded Sri Lanka to CCC citing fiscal\nand external concerns. In December 2020, Standard and Poor's followed,\ndowngrading to 'CCC+', citing high fiscal deficits and excessive domestic\nliquidity, which was also protested by the Finance Ministry.\n\n**Investments**\n\nSri Lanka's investment-to-GDP ratio is around 31%, made up of about 24%\nprivate and 5% public investment. The private savings rate is about 24% and\nthe government is a net dis-saver leaving a domestic savings investment gap of\naround 7% of GDP. In 2019 investment fell to 27.4% of GDP from 30.4% a year\nearlier with the domestic savings rate also falling to 21.3% of GDP from 23%.\nSri Lanka's savings rate is undermined by government dis-saving (the revenue\ndeficit), which rose from 1.2 to 2.7% in 2019.\n\nThere are attempts to improve Sri Lanka's \"Ease of Doing Business index' (Sri\nLanka stood at 111 for 2018 down from 85th in 2014) and the overall tariff\nstructure. In 1992, Sri Lanka's exports were on par with countries like\nVietnam and Bangladesh (at US$2bn), which has only grown to US$12bn by the end\nof 2017 compared to Vietnam's US$214bn and Bangladesh's US$36bn for 2017."

The Central Bank will continue to remain vigilant but is\nconfident that inflation will remain within the targeted range of 4-6 per cent\nover the medium-term. But after worsening balance of payments trouble and\ninflation, rates were hiked in August and the statutory reserve ratio was also\nraised.\n\nSri Lanka used a 'flexible inflation targeting' framework for monetary policy\nat least until 2019. In 2020 growth took a priority, Governor Lakshman has\nsaid as efforts are made to boost output amid a COVID-19 pandemic. Sri Lanka\nsuffered a US$3.2bn balance of payments deficit in 2020 amid monetary easing."

Private sector credit\ngrowth declined from high levels of 29% YoY in July 2016 to 15% YoY levels in\n1Q2018.\n\nGiven the changes taking place in the private credit space (i.e. the retail\ntilt), and provided the CBSL's recent policy rate cut in April 2018, credit\ngrowth may still continue to move either horizontally (i.e. at a 15% level) or\ncontinue to reduce slightly given anticipated near term inflationary\npressures, as the consumption-led borrowings may also tend to decline on\naccount of the anticipated reduction in near term disposable income. This will\nhowever not add any excessive upward pressures on interest rates (including\n12-month T bill yields), especially during 2H2018E. As a result, 12-month\nTreasury bill yields may slightly decline from its June 2018 --> 9.4% to 9%\nlevels by the end of 2018E. However, given the International Sovereign Bond\n(ISB) bullet payments >US$3bn p.a. commencing from 2019E may likely add some\nupward pressure on interest rates, resulting in the 12-month T bill yields\nrising to at least 10% by 30 June 2019."

Major tourist attractions\nare focused around the island's famous beaches located in the southern and the\neastern parts of the country and ancient heritage sites located in the\ninterior of the country and resorts located in the mountainous regions of the\ncountry. Also, due to precious stones such as rubies and sapphires being\nfrequently found and mined in Ratnapura and its surrounding areas, they are a\nmajor tourist attraction.\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the past civil war have reduced the tourist\narrivals, as a civil war intensified. Foreign visitors fell from 566,202 in\n2004 during a ceasefire with Tamil Tiger separatists to 447,890 by the end of\nthe war in 2009. From then arrivals grew rapidly to 2,333,796 in 2019. The\n2019 Easter Sunday bombings reduced arrivals to 1,913,702 though authorities\nacted quickly to round up the group and travel advisories were relaxed by key\ngenerating markets such as the UK as early as June 2019. Lonely Planet named\nSri Lanka the best destination to visit in 2019 and Travel+Leisure the best\nisland.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dealt a major blow to the industry after airports were\nclosed in March 2020. Tourism revenues were estimated to have fallen to\nUS$956mn in 2020 from US$3.6bn in 2019 hurting over 300,000 said to be\nconnected to the industry.

It became the world's\nleading exporter in 1995 with a 23% share of global tea export, higher than\nKenya's 22% share. The central highlands of the country have a low-temperature\nclimate throughout the year and annual rainfall and humidity levels that are\nsuitable for growing tea. The industry was introduced to the country in 1867\nby James Taylor, a British planter who arrived in 1852.\n\nRecently, Sri Lanka has become one of the countries exporting fair trade tea\nto the UK and other countries. It is believed that such projects could reduce\nrural poverty."

    "text": "In June 2021, Sri Lanka started the first 100% organic farming or biological\nagriculture program and imposed a countrywide ban on inorganic fertilizers and\npesticides. The program was welcomed by its advisor Vandana Shiva, but ignored\ncritical voices from scientific and farming community who warned about\npossible collapse of farming, including financial crisis due to devaluation of\nnational currency pivoted around tea industry. In the autumn of 2021 Sri Lanka\nexperienced a massive drop in farming output by up to 50% and food shortages.\nThe situation in the tea industry was described as critical, with farming\nunder the organic program being described as 10x more expensive and producing\nhalf of the yield by the farmers. In September 2021 the government announced\n\"economic emergency\", as the situation was further aggravated by falling\nnational currency exchange rate, inflation rising as result of high food\nprices, and pandemic restrictions in tourism which further decreased country's\nincome. The government cancelled some of these measures, but importing urea\nremains banned. Sri Lanka is seeking to introduce peacetime rationing of\nessential goods.\n\nIn mid-October 2021 the ban was largely lifted \"until the island was able to\nproduce enough organic fertiliser\". In November 2021, Sri Lanka abandoned its\nplan to become the world's first organic farming nation following rising food\nprices and weeks of protests against the plan. As of December 2021, the damage\nto the agricultural production was already done, with prices having risen\nsubstantially for vegetables in Sri Lanka, and time needed to recover from the\ncrisis. The ban on fertilizer has been lifted for certain crops, but the price\nof urea has risen internationally due to the price for oil and gas. Jeevika\nWeerahewa, a senior lecturer at the University of Peradeniya, predicted that\nthe ban would reduce the paddy harvest in 2022 by an unprecedented 50%."

Ceylon sapphires are among the\nmost desirable in the gemstone market and can regularly fetch thousands per\ncarat. Contrary to popular belief Ceylon produces sapphires of all colours,\nincluding padparascha types, though blue is the most desirable and yields the\nhighest prices. Some of the world's largest sapphires, such as the Logan\nSapphire and Blue Belle of Asia, have come from Sri Lanka.\n\nThe best-known areas for gemstone mining in Sri Lanka were Balangoda, Elahera,\nKamburupitiya, Moneragala, Okkampitiya, and Ratnapura. In addition, Sri Lanka\nhas a variety of industrial minerals, which include ball clay, kaolin, and\nother clays, calcite, dolomite, feldspar, graphite, limestone, Ilmenite, mica,\nrutile mineral sands, phosphate rock, quartz, zircon, dolomite and silica\nsand. Pulmoddai beach sand deposit is the most important non-ferrous mineral\nreserve in Sri Lanka as well as one of the world's most richest mineral sand\ndeposits with heavy mineral concentrates of 50% to 60% and contains many\nminerals including titanium.\n\nSri Lanka is famous, especially for its highly valued and high-purity vein\ngraphite. As of 2014, graphite was produced at the two largest graphite mines\nin Sri Lanka, the Bogala and the Kahatagaha Mines.

    "text": "During the years before 2016, the country's debt soared as it was developing\nits infrastructure to the point of near bankruptcy which required a bailout\nfrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"Without an IMF loan, Sri Lanka\nwould have been in a precarious position\" in May 2016, according to Krystal\nTan, an Asia economist at Capital Economics, who added, \"foreign exchange\nreserves only covered around 80 per cent of short-term external debt.\" The IMF\nhad agreed to provide a $1.5 billion bailout loan in April 2016 after Sri\nLanka provided a set of criteria intended to improve its economy.\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 2016, the debt was estimated to be $64.9 billion.\nAdditional debt had been incurred in the past by state-owned organizations and\nthis was said to be at least $9.5 billion. Since early 2015, domestic debt has\nincreased by 12 per cent and external debt by 25 per cent.\n\nIn late 2016 the World Bank provided US$100 million in financing and the Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency provided a US$100M loan, both intended to\n\"provide budget financing and to support reforms in competitiveness,\ntransparency, public sector and fiscal management\", according to the World\nBank. The bank also reported that the country's government had agreed that\nthere was a need for reforms \"in the areas of fiscal operations,\ncompetitiveness and governance\" and if fully implemented, \"these could help\nthe country reach Upper Middle-Income status in the medium term\" according to\nthe bank.\n\nIn November 2016, the International Monetary Fund reported that it would\ndisburse a higher amount than the US$150 million originally planned, a full\nUS$162.6 million (SDR 119.894 million), to Sri Lanka. The agency's evaluation\nwas cautiously optimistic about the future: \"While inflation has abated,\ncredit growth remains strong. The central bank indicates its readiness to\ntighten the monetary policy stance further if inflationary pressures resurge\nor credit growth persists. The authorities intend to continue building up\nreserves through outright purchases while allowing for greater exchange rate\nflexibility. The banking sector is currently well-capitalized. Steps are being\ntaken to find a resolution mechanism for distressed financial institutions.\nGoing forward, there is a need to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory\nframework, and identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the financial sector,\nparticularly with regard to non-banks and state-owned banks.\"\n\nAs part of the debt management program, the Sri Lankan government carried out\nseveral reforms which included the implementation of a new Inland Revenue Act\nas well as an automatic fuel pricing formula. Tax reforms also increased VAT\nrates and narrowed exemptions and the third review by the IMF noted that\nperformance was on track regarding fiscal consolidation, revenue mobilization,\nmonetary policy management, and reserves accumulation. In the fourth review in\nJune 2018, the IMF claimed that \"Sri Lanka has made important progress under\nits Fund-supported program\", but stressed the need for further progress with\nrevenue-based fiscal consolidation and a prudent monetary policy with\nsustained efforts to build up international reserves. In 2018 China extended a\nloan of $1.25 billion consisting of a below-market-rate syndicated loan and\nsmaller Panda bond to bail out Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 2021, Bangladesh agreed to give Sri Lanka loans of at least $200 million\nfrom the foreign exchange reserves under a currency swap deal. The currency\nswap initiative was taken after Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s\nvisit to Bangladesh to attend the joint celebrations of the golden jubilee of\nBangladesh's independence and the birth centenary of Bangabandhu.[_citation\nneeded_] In December 2021, Sri Lanka announced that it would pay off a $251\nmillion oil debt to Iran by sending $5 million worth of Ceylon tea every\nmonth. A strong and credible structural reform program is critical to avoid a\nprolonged crisis and address the (above) root causes of the current economic\ndifficulties. As the country struggled, locked in the throes of the crisis,\nIndia extended multi-pronged assistance of about USD 4 billion in 2022 through\nmultiple credit lines and currency support, in line with India's 'Neighborhood\nFirst' policy.[7]"
