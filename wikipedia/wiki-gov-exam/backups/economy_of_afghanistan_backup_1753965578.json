With a population of around 41\nmillion people, Afghanistan's GDP (nominal) stands at $14.58 billion as of\n2021, amounting to a GDP per capita of $363.7 (according to a World Bank\nreport). Its annual exports exceed $2 billion, with agricultural, mineral and\ntextile products accounting for 94% of total exports. The nation's total\nexternal debt is $1.4 billion as of 2022.\n\nThe Afghan economy continues to improve due to the influx of expats,\nestablishment of more trade routes with neighboring and regional countries,\nand expansion of the nation's agriculture, energy and mining sectors. The\nbillions of dollars in assistance that came from expats and the international\ncommunity saw this increase when there was more political reliability after\nNATO became involved in Afghanistan.\n\nDespite holding over one trillion dollars in proven untapped mineral deposits,\nAfghanistan remains one of the least developed countries in the world. Its\nunemployment rate is over 23% and about half of its population lives below the\npoverty line. The main factor behind this has been the continuous war in the\ncountry, which deterred business investors and left much of the population\nfighting among each other instead of catching up with the rest of the world.\nAfghanistan has long sought foreign investment in order to improve its\neconomy.

    "text": "When Afghanistan was ruled by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan (1880–1901) and his son\nHabibullah Khan (1901–1919), a great deal of commerce was controlled by the\ngovernment. These monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and\nthe country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the\nimposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. This\nslowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western\ntechnologies and manufacturing methods were introduced at the command of the\nAfghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of\nthe growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and\nother military material. This process was in the hands of a small number of\nforeign experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not\npossible for non-Afghans, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale\nenterprises in Afghanistan during that period.\n\nIn the post-independence period, DAB strongly financed the cultivation of\ncotton; at one point, the Spinzar Cotton Company in Kunduz Province was one of\nthe largest providers of cotton in the world, most of which were exported to\nthe Soviet Union. Fruits were mainly exported to British-controlled India.\n\nThe first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was\nthe Helmand Valley Authority project of 1952, modeled on the Tennessee Valley\nAuthority in the United States, which was expected to be of primary economic\nimportance. Glenn Foster, an American contractor working in Afghanistan in the\n1950s, stated this about the Afghan people:\n\n> Even though there are masses of people, the country seems able to feed them\n> all. Although their diet may not be abundant, you don't see the hunger that\n> you do in some countries....\n\nAfghanistan began facing severe economic hardships during the 1979 Soviet\ninvasion and ensuing civil war destroyed much of the country's limited\ninfrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity.\nEventually, Afghanistan went from a traditional economy to a centrally planned\neconomy up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy. Gross\ndomestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of\ntrade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal\nstrife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide\nways for the international community to help.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the Afghan economy grew 20% in\nthe fiscal year ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12\nmonths. The growth was mainly attributed to United Nations assistance.\nBillions of dollars in international aid had entered Afghanistan from 2002 to\n2021. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to\n$6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from opium production. Mean graduate pay\nwas $0.56 per man-hour in 2010. The country expects to be self sufficient in\nwheat, rice, poultry and dairy production by 2026.\n\nThe recent reestablishment of the Taliban government led to temporary\nsuspension of international development aid to Afghanistan. The World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund also halted payments during that period. In this\nregard, Taliban's spiritual leader Hibatullah Akhundzada stated, \"The economy\nof a country is built when its people work together and do not rely on foreign\naid[.]\" The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to\nthe DAB, which was intended to block the Taliban from accessing the money. The\nrecent droughts, earthquakes and floods in the country have created further\nadverse economic situation for many residents. The Ministry of Finance has\ncollected over $2 billion in 2022.\n\nThe GDP of Afghanistan is estimated to have dropped by 20% following the\nTaliban return to power. Following this, after months of free-fall, the Afghan\neconomy began stabilizing, as a result of the Taliban's restrictions on\nsmuggled imports, limits on banking transactions, and UN aid. In 2023, the\nAfghan economy began seeing signs of revival. This has also been followed by\nstable exchange rates, low inflation, stable revenue collection, and the rise\nof trade in exports. In the third quarter of 2023, the Afghani rose to be the\nbest performing currency in the world, climbing over 9% against the US dollar.",

    "text": "Afghanistan's geographical location makes it economically secured. The Lapis\nLazuli corridor connects Afghanistan with Turkmenistan and ultimately ends\nsomewhere in Europe. Other such trade routes connect Afghanistan with\nneighboring Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The country also has\ndirect trade with China and India via air corridor. It has four international\nairports, which include: Kabul International Airport in the capital city;\nMazar-e Sharif International Airport in the north of the country; Herat\nInternational Airport in the west; and the Ahmad Shah Baba International\nAirport in Kandahar. It also has about 24 domestic airports. The major\nairlines of the country include Ariana Afghan Airlines and Kam Air. Its\nnational rail network is slowly expanding to connect Central Asia with\nPakistan and Iran. In addition to Central Asia, imported goods also enter by\nrail from neighboring Iran and China.\n\nThe Port of entry at Sher Khan Bandar in Kunduz Province, near the border with\nTajikistan (2011)\n\nThe Afghanistan–Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) allows Afghan and\nPakistani cargo trucks to transit goods within both nations. This revised US-\nsponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to\nIndia via Pakistan up to the Wagah crossing point. There are over a dozen\nofficial border crossing points all around Afghanistan. They include Abu Nasir\nPort in Farah Province, Ai-Khanoum in Takhar Province, Angur Ada in Paktika\nProvince, Aqina in Faryab Province, Dand-aw-Patan in Paktia Province, Ghulam\nKhan in Khost Province, Hairatan in Balkh Province, Ishkashim in Badakhshan\nProvince, Islam Qala in Herat Province, Sher Khan Bandar in Kunduz Province,\nTorghundi in Herat Province, Torkham in Nangarhar Province, Spin Boldak in\nKandahar Province, and Zaranj in Nimruz Province. The country also has legal\naccess to two major seaports in Pakistan, the Gwadar Port in Balochistan and\nthe Port Qasim in Sindh. Afghanistan also has legal access to major seaports\nin Iran, which include the one in Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf and the\nChabahar Port in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nDue to lack of major rail service, transport in Afghanistan is mostly done by\nroad and air.\n\nAfghanistan is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, which include\nextensive deposits of barites, chromite, coal, copper, gold, gemstone, iron\nore, lead, lithium, marble, natural gas, petroleum, salt, sulfur, talc,\nuranium, and zinc. Rare-earth elements can be found all over the country. In\n2006, a U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Afghanistan has as much as\n1,000×10~~^~~ 6 m3 (36×10~~^~~ 9 cu ft) of natural gas, 570×10~~^~~ 6 m3 (3.6\nGbbl) of oil and condensate reserves. According to a 2007 assessment,\nAfghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral\nresources. Geologists also found indications of abundant deposits of colored\nstones and gemstones, including emerald, garnet, kunzite, lapis lazuli,\nperidot, ruby, sapphire, spinel, and tourmaline.\n\nIt is claimed that Afghanistan has at least $1 trillion in untapped mineral\ndeposits. A memo from the Pentagon stated that Afghanistan could become the\n\"Saudi Arabia of lithium\". Some believe that the untapped minerals are worth\nup to $3 trillion. The Khanashin carbonatites in the Helmand Province of the\ncountry have an estimated 1 million metric tonnes of rare earth elements.\n\nAfghanistan currently has a copper mining deal with China Metallurgical Group\nCorporation, which involves the investment of $2.8 billion by China and an\nannual income of about $400 million to the Afghan government. The country's\nAinak copper mine, located in Logar Province, is one of the biggest in the\nworld. It is estimated to hold at least 11 million tonnes or US$33 billion\nworth of copper.\n\nThe previous government has signed a 30-year contract with investment group\nCentar and its operating company, Afghan Gold and Minerals Co., to explore and\ndevelop a copper mining operation in Balkhab District in Sar-e Pol Province,\nincluding a gold mining operation in Badakhshan Province. The copper contract\ninvolved a $56 million investment and the gold contract a $22 million\ninvestment.\n\nThe country's other recently announced treasure is the Hajigak iron mine,\nlocated 210 km (130 mi) west of Kabul and is believed to hold an estimated 1.8\nbillion to 2 billion metric tons of the mineral used to make steel. The\ncountry also has a number of coal mines.\n\nAfghanistan's important resource in the past has been natural gas, which was\nfirst tapped in 1967. During the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a\nyear in export revenues (56% of the total). About 90% of these exports went to\nthe Soviet Union to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal\nof Soviet troops in 1989, the natural gas fields were capped to prevent\nsabotage by criminals. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2×10~~^~~ 6\nm3 (290×10~~^~~ 6 cu ft) per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 m3\n(21×10~~^~~ 6 cu ft) in 2001. Production of natural gas was restored during\nthe Karzai administration in 2010.\n\nIt is predicted that by pumping-out its own oil reserves, Afghanistan will no\nlonger be importing oil products after 2026. Originally, the Karzai\nadministration and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a\ncontract for the development of three oil fields in the northern provinces of\nSar-e Pol, Jowzjan and Faryab. It was later reported that CNPC began\nextracting 240,000 m3 (1.5×10~~^~~ 6 bbl) of oil annually. In early 2023, the\nXinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company signed a similar contract with\nthe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Russia had also found interest in oil and\ngas supply to Afghanistan.",

In 1952 it created the Helmand Valley Authority\nto manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys\nthrough irrigation and land development, a scheme which remains one of the\ncountry's most important capital resources.\n\nIn 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious\ndevelopment plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results\ndue to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a\nshortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.\n\nAfghan United Bank\n\nDa Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation. The \"afghani\"\n(AFN) is the national currency, which has an exchange rate of around 70\nafghanis to 1 US dollar. There are over a dozen different banks operating in\nthe country, including Afghanistan International Bank, Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank,\nPashtany Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and First Micro Finance Bank. Cash is\nstill widely used for most transactions. A new law on private investment\nprovides three to seven-year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four-\nyear exemption from exports tariffs and duties. Improvements to the business-\nenabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom\ninvestment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.\n\nAfghanistan is a member of ECO, OIC, SAARC, and WTO. It has an observer status\nin the SCO. It seeks to complete the so-called _New Silk Road_ trade project,\nwhich is aimed to connecting South Asia with Central Asia and the Middle East.\nThis way Afghanistan will be able to collect large fees from trade passing\nthrough the country, including from the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline.\n\nShopping district in the Khair Khana neighborhood of Kabul\n\nSome of the ongoing national mega projects include the Qosh Tepa Canal project\nin the north of the country and the New Kabul City. Other smaller development\nprojects include the Qatar Township in Kabul, Aino Mena in Kandahar and the\nGhazi Amanullah Khan Town east of Jalalabad. Similar projects are also found\nin Herat in the west, Mazar-e-Sharif in the north, Khost in the east, and in\nother cities.\n\nThere are as much as 5,000 factories in Afghanistan. Most are locally owned,\nwhile others involve foreign investors. They produce construction materials,\nfurniture, household items, apparel, food, beverages, pharmaceutical products,\netc. The country imports roughly $500 million of textile goods from other\ncountries. It exported about $168 million worth of cotton in 2022. Afghan\nhandwoven rugs are one of the most popular products for exportation. Other\nproducts include hand crafted antique replicas as well as leather and furs.\nAfghanistan is the third largest exporter of cashmere.\n\nAfter the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan returned to power, the country\nsuffered from a major liquidity crisis and lack of banknotes. Because outside\ndonors have severely cut funding to support Afghanistan's health, education,\nand other essential sectors, many Afghans lost their incomes. Under the\nassessment system of the World Food Programme (WFP), almost 20 million people\nsuffered either level-3 “crisis” or level-4 “emergency” levels of food\ninsecurity. The crisis’ impact on women and girls was especially severe.\nOfficials under the new Islamic Emirate continue to provide communication\nservices to areas that lacked them. The government collected 61 billion\nafghanis in tariffs in 2022, which increased to 76 billion in 2023. It\ncontinues to attract foreign investors.",
