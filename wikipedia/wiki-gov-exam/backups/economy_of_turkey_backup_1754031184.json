It ranked as the\n16th-largest in the world and 7th-largest in Europe by nominal GDP in 2025. It\nalso ranked as the 12th-largest in the world and 5th-largest in Europe by PPP\nin 2025. Turkey's rapid economic growth since the 2000s was stranded by the\neconomic crisis in 2018, but it began to recover in 2021. Turkey's USD-based\nnominal GDP per capita and GDP-PPP per capita have eventually reached their\nall-time peak values in 2024.\n\nTurkey is a founding member of the OECD and G20. Ratified in 1995, the\nEuropean Union–Turkey Customs Union has established a free trade area between\nTurkey and the European Union, which has increased bilateral foreign trade,\ninvestment and economic activity.\n\nAs the fifth most visited destination in the world, Turkey has a large tourism\nindustry, which accounted for 12% of the country's total GDP in 2023. First\nestablished in 2000, many technoparks were pioneered by Turkish universities,\nnow hosting over 1,600 R&D centers that drew investment by both domestic and\ninternational corporations. Turkey is also among the world's leading producers\nof motor vehicles, consumer electronics, home appliances and defense products.\nIn 2021, the country was ranked eighth in the world in the technology rankings\nof the Economic Complexity Index.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 21st century, there have been major developments\nin the financial and social aspects of Turkey's economy, such as increases in\nemployment and average income since 2000. A period of strong economic growth\nbetween 2002 and 2013 (except for 2009 due to the 2008 financial crisis) was\nfollowed by a period of stagnation and recession in terms of USD-based nominal\nGDP figures between 2014 and 2020, especially during the 2018 Turkish currency\nand debt crisis; even though Turkey's USD-based GDP-PPP and TL-based nominal\nGDP have continued to grow in this period. Since 2021, there has been a steady\nrecovery and rapid growth in Turkey's USD-based nominal GDP and GDP-PPP\nfigures, which have reached their all-time highest values in both 2023 and\n2024.\n\nGrowth-focused and populistic financial policies, such as the preference to\nkeep interest rates as low as possible (dubbed _Erdoganomics_) have led to one\nof the world's highest inflation rates since 2018. Following the Turkish\nparliamentary and presidential elections on May 14 and 28, 2023, and the\nappointment of Mehmet Şimşek as the Minister of Treasury and Finance on June\n4, 2023, Turkey has adopted a more orthodox monetary policy regarding interest\nrates and has succeeded in gradually decreasing inflation from 85.5% in late\n2022 to 42.1% in early 2025.",

Istanbul has\nthe largest GDP, while Kocaeli comes first in GDP per capita.\n\nThe country's wealth is mainly concentrated in the northwest and west, while\nthe east and southeast suffer from poverty, lower economic production and\nhigher levels of unemployment. However, in line with the rapid growth of\nTurkey's GDP during the first two decades of the 21st century (with brief\nperiods of stagnation and recession), parts of Anatolia began reaching a\nhigher economic standard. These cities are known as the Anatolian Tigers."
