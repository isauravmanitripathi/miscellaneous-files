It is the world's\nlargest economy by nominal GDP and second largest by purchasing power parity\n(PPP). As of 2025, it has the world's seventh highest nominal GDP per capita\nand ninth highest GDP per capita by PPP. The U.S. accounts for 27% of the\nglobal economy in 2025 in nominal terms, and about 16% in PPP terms. The U.S.\ndollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and\nis the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its\nrole as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked\neurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others\nit is the _de facto_ currency. Since the end of World War II, the economy has\nachieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid\nadvances in technology.\n\nThe American economy is fueled by high productivity, well-developed\ntransportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have\nthe sixth highest average household and employee income among OECD member\nstates. In 2021, they had the highest median household income among OECD\ncountries, although the country also had one of the world's highest income\ninequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners\nare Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom,\nTaiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and\nsecond-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries,\nincluding Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea,\nIsrael, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation. The U.S.\nhas a highly flexible labor market, where the industry adheres to a hire-and-\nfire policy, and job security is relatively low. Among OECD nations, the U.S.\nhas a highly efficient social security system; social expenditure stood at\nroughly 30% of GDP.\n\nThe United States is the world's largest producer of petroleum, natural gas,\nand blood products. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country, and\nsecond largest manufacturer, with American manufacturing making up a fifth of\nthe global total. The U.S. has the largest internal market for goods, and also\ndominates the services trade. Total U.S. trade was $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of\nthe world's 500 largest companies, 139 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S.\nhas the world's highest number of billionaires, with total wealth of $5.7\ntrillion. U.S. commercial banks had $22.9 trillion in assets in December 2022.\nU.S. global assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets.\nDuring the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant\ndecline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was enacted by the United\nStates Congress, and in the ensuing years the U.S. experienced the longest\neconomic expansion on record by July 2019.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges\nby market capitalization and trade volume. The U.S. has the world's largest\ngold reserves, with over 8,000 tonnes of gold. In 2014, the U.S. economy was\nranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research\nand development funding. The U.S. spends around 3.46% of GDP on cutting-edge\nresearch and development across various sectors of the economy. Consumer\nspending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of\nincome was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The\nnation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its\nnet migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the\ntop-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index,\nthe Global Competitiveness Report, and others.",

    "text": "Washburn and Moen Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, 1876\n\nIn 180 years, the United States grew to become a huge, integrated, and\nindustrialized economy, which made up about a fifth of the world economy. In\nthat process, the U.S. GDP per capita rose past that of many other countries,\nsupplanting the British Empire at the top. The economy maintained high wages,\nattracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world. In the 1820s\nand 1830s, mass production shifted much of the economy from artisans to\nfactories. New government regulations strengthened patents.\n\nEarly in the 19th century, more than 80 percent of Americans engaged in\nfarming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of the\ntransformation of raw materials, with lumber and sawmills, textiles, and boots\nand shoes leading the way. The rich natural resources contributed to the rapid\neconomic expansion of the nineteenth century. Ample land allowed the number of\nfarmers to keep growing; but activity in manufacturing, services,\ntransportation, and other sectors grew much faster, so that by 1860 the\npopulation was only about 50 percent rural, down from over 80 percent.\n\nIn the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with financial crises.\nThe Panic of 1837 was followed by a five-year depression, marked by bank\nfailures and unprecedented unemployment. Because of the great changes in the\neconomy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern\nrecessions to that of early recessions. Recessions after World War II appear\nto have been less severe than earlier recessions, but the reasons for this are\nunclear.",

    "text": "Oil wells in Los Angeles, 1905 Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at\nKansas City, 1942 McDonald's restaurant in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, 2008\n\nAt the beginning of the century, new innovations and improvements in existing\ninnovations opened the door for improvements in the standard of living among\nAmerican consumers. Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of\nscale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in\nthese industries raised fears of monopolies that would drive prices higher and\noutput lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends\nwere towards lower prices and more output in these industries. Many workers\nshared the success of these large firms, which typically offered the highest\nwages in the world.\n\nThe United States has been the world's largest national economy in terms of\nGDP since around 1890. For many years following the Great Depression of the\n1930s, when the danger of recession appeared most serious, the government\nstrengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that\nconsumers would spend more and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply,\nwhich also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for\nstabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.\nFrom the New Deal era that began in 1933 to the Great Society initiatives of\nthe 1960s, national policymakers relied principally on fiscal policy to\ninfluence the economy.\n\nDuring the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better\nthan the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and\nrelatively little of the Second World War were fought on American territory\n(and none on the then-48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars\nmeant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40\npercent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large\nswaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes, and nearly all\nrelevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed,\nprices and wages controlled, and many durable consumer goods were no longer\nproduced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military and\npaid half their wages; roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.\n\nThe approach, advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes, gave elected\nofficials a leading role in directing the economy since spending and taxes are\ncontrolled by the U.S. president and Congress. The \"Baby Boom\" saw a dramatic\nincrease in fertility in the period 1942–1957; it was caused by delayed\nmarriages and childbearing during the depression years, a surge in prosperity,\na demand for suburban single-family homes (as opposed to inner city\napartments), and new optimism about the future. The boom peaked around 1957\nand then began to fade. A period of high inflation, interest rates, and\nunemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for\nregulating the overall pace of economic activity.\n\nThe U.S. economy grew by an average of 3.8% from 1946 to 1973, while real\nmedian household income surged by 74% (or 2.1% a year).\n\nSince the 1970s, several emerging countries have begun to close the economic\ngap with the United States. In most cases, this has been due to moving the\nmanufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could\nbe made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a\nhigher profit. In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to\nproduce the same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few\nother countries could produce. Real income growth in the U.S. has slowed. In\nthe 1970s and 1980s, it was popular in the U.S. to believe that Japan's\neconomy would surpass that of the U.S., but this did not occur.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump with automobile industry leaders, 2017 (First Term)\n\nThe United States economy experienced a recession in 2001 with an unusually\nslow jobs recovery, with the number of jobs not regaining the February 2001\nlevel until January 2005. This \"jobless recovery\" overlapped with the building\nof a housing bubble and arguably a wider debt bubble, as the ratio of\nhousehold debt to GDP rose from a record level of 70% in Q1 2001 to 99% in Q1\n2008. Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel\nconsumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable\nboost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of\nsecurities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a\nbank run in the essentially unregulated non-depository banking system, which\nhad outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system. Many\nmortgage companies and other non-depository banks (e.g., investment banks)\nfaced a worsening crisis in 2007–2008, with the banking crisis peaking in\nSeptember 2008, with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and bailouts of several\nother financial institutions.\n\nThe Bush administration (2001–2009) and Obama administrations (2009–2017)\napplied banking bailout programs and Keynesian stimulus via high government\ndeficits, while the Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates. These\nmeasures helped the economy recover, as households paid down debts in\n2009–2012, the only years since 1947 where this occurred, presenting a\nsignificant barrier to recovery. Real GDP regained its pre-crisis (late 2007)\npeak by 2011, household net worth by Q2 2012, non-farm payroll jobs by May\n2014, and the unemployment rate by September 2015. Each of these variables\ncontinued into post-recession record territory following those dates, with the\nU.S. recovery becoming the second longest on record in April 2018.\n\nThe Great Recession occurred during the 2008 financial crisis, when GDP fell\nby 5.0% from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009. Other significant\nrecessions took place in 1957–1958, when GDP fell 3.7% following the 1973 oil\ncrisis, with a 3.1% fall from late 1973 to early 1975, and in the 1981–1982\nrecession, when GDP dropped by 2.9%. Recent, mild recessions have included the\n1990–1991 downturn, when output fell by 1.3%, and the 2001 recession, in which\nGDP slid by 0.3%; the 2001 downturn lasted just eight months. The most\nvigorous, sustained periods of growth, on the other hand, took place from\nearly 1961 to mid-1969, with an expansion of 53% (5.1% a year), from mid-1991\nto late 2000, at 43% (3.8% a year), and from late 1982 to mid-1990, at 37% (4%\na year).\n\nDebt held by the public, a measure of national debt, has risen throughout the\n21st century.

      "• The United States economy experienced a recession in 2001 characterized by an unusually slow jobs recovery, with the number of jobs not returning to the February 2001 level until January 2005, a phenomenon termed a \"jobless recovery.\"",
      "• This jobless recovery coincided with the formation of a housing bubble and a broader debt bubble, as the ratio of household debt to GDP increased from a record 70% in the first quarter of 2001 to 99% in the first quarter of 2008.",
      "• Homeowners increasingly borrowed against inflated home values, fueling consumption and driving up household debt levels, which temporarily boosted GDP but was unsustainable.",
      "• Beginning in 2006, housing prices declined, causing a sharp fall in the value of mortgage-backed securities, which precipitated a crisis akin to a bank run in the largely unregulated non-depository banking sector that had expanded beyond the traditional regulated depository banks.",
      "• The financial crisis intensified in 2007–2008, culminating in September 2008 with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and government bailouts of several other financial institutions.",
      "• The Bush administration (2001–2009) and Obama administration (2009–2017) responded with banking bailout programs and Keynesian fiscal stimulus involving high government deficits, while the Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates to support economic recovery.",
      "• Between 2009 and 2012, households reduced their debt levels, marking the only period since 1947 where this occurred, which had been a significant impediment to economic recovery.",
      "• Key recovery milestones included real GDP regaining its pre-crisis late 2007 peak by 2011, household net worth recovering by the second quarter of 2012, non-farm payroll jobs returning to pre-recession levels by May 2014, and the unemployment rate normalizing by September 2015.",
      "• Following these recoveries, each economic indicator continued to reach record levels, with the U.S. economic recovery becoming the second longest on record as of April 2018.",
      "• The Great Recession, part of the 2008 financial crisis, saw a 5.0% decline in GDP from spring 2008 to spring 2009, making it the most severe recession since the mid-20th century.",
      "• Other notable recessions included a 3.7% GDP contraction in 1957–1958, a 3.1% decline following the 1973 oil crisis from late 1973 to early 1975, and a 2.9% drop during the 1981–1982 recession.",
      "• More recent mild recessions were the 1990–1991 downturn with a 1.3% output fall, and the brief 2001 recession lasting eight months with a 0.3% GDP decline.",
      "• The most vigorous and sustained U.S. economic expansions in the 20th century were from early 1961 to mid-1969 with 53% growth (5.1% annually), mid-1991 to late 2000 with 43% growth (3.8% annually), and late 1982 to mid-1990 with 37% growth (4% annually).",

Social distancing measures\nwhich took effect in March 2020, and which negatively impacted the demand for\ngoods and services, resulted in the US GDP declining at a 4.8% annualized rate\nin the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the\nfourth quarter of 2008. US retails sales dropped a record 8.7% in March alone.\nThe US airline industry had also been hit hard, seeing a sharp decline in its\nrevenues. The COVID-19 recession has been widely described as the most severe\nglobal economic downturn since the Great Depression and \"far worse\" than the\nGreat Recession.\n\nMidtown Manhattan, the world's largest central business district\n\nIn May 2020, CNN gave an analysis based on unemployment data that the US\neconomy was perhaps the worst that it had been since the 1930s. By May 8, the\nUS had reached a record 14.7 percent unemployment, with 20.5 million jobs lost\nin April. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, warned that\nit may take \"an extended time\" before the US economy fully recovers from weak\neconomic growth, due to the pandemic, and that in the foreseeable future the\nUS can expect \"low productivity growth and stagnant incomes\". By May 31, 2020,\nmore than forty million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.\n\nBy June 2020, the slump in US continental flights due to the coronavirus\npandemic had resulted in the US government temporarily halting service of\nfifteen US airlines to 75 domestic airports. _The New York Times_ reported on\nJune 10, 2020, that \"the United States budget deficit grew to a record $1.88\ntrillion for the first eight months of this fiscal year.\"\n\nThe US economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, growing by 5.7%,\nwhich was its best performance since Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981–1989).\n\n2021–2022 marked a historical inflation surge in the United States, with the\nConsumer Price Index inflation rate hitting 9.1% higher in June 2022 than June\n2021, constituting a 41-year high inflation rate with critics blaming the\nFederal Reserve among other factors. Inflation rate reached 4.9% in April\n2023, which was roughly 3% above the Federal Reserve's 2% target rate.",

About 70% of U.S. GDP is personal consumption, with\nbusiness investment 18%, government 17% (federal, state and local but\nexcluding transfer payments such as Social Security, which is in consumption)\nand net exports a negative 3% due to the U.S. trade deficit. Real gross\ndomestic product, a measure of both production and income, grew by 2.3% in\n2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Real GDP grew at a quarterly\nannualized rate of 2.2% in Q1 2018, 4.2% in Q2 2018, 3.4% in Q3 2018, and 2.2%\nin Q4 2018; the Q2 rate was the best growth rate since Q3 2014, and the\noverall yearly GDP growth of 2.9% in 2018 was the best performance of the\neconomy in a decade. In 2020, the growth rate of the GDP has started to drop\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the GDP shrinking at a\nquarterized annual growth rate of −5.0% in Q1 2020[_citation needed_] and\n−32.9% in Q2 2020,[_citation needed_] respectively.\n\nAs of 2014, China passed the U.S. as the largest economy in GDP (PPP) terms,\nmeasured at purchasing power parity conversion rates.

Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are\ndebated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population\nand growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate\ninvestment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major\ninnovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220\ncountries in GDP per capita in 2017.

The government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the\npart-time underemployed, was 8.1% or 8.2 million people. These figures were\ncalculated with a civilian labor force of approximately 160.6 million people,\nrelative to a U.S. population of approximately 327 million people.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010, following the Great Recession, the emerging problem of\njobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term unemployment with\nmore than six million workers looking for work for more than six months as of\nJanuary 2010. This particularly affected older workers. A year after the\nrecession ended in June 2009, immigrants gained 656,000 jobs in the U.S.,\nwhile U.S.-born workers lost more than a million jobs, due in part to an aging\ncountry (relatively more white retirees) and demographic shifts. In April\n2010, the official unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the government's broader\nU-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%. Between February 2008 and February 2010, the\nnumber of people working part-time for economic reasons (i.e., would prefer to\nwork full-time) increased by 4.0 million to 8.8 million, an 83% increase in\npart-time workers during the two-year period.\n\nBy 2013, although the unemployment rate had fallen below 8%, the record\nproportion of long term unemployed and continued decreasing household income\nremained indicative of a jobless recovery. However, the number of payroll jobs\nreturned to its pre-recession (November 2007) level by May 2014 as the economy\nrecovered.\n\nAfter being higher in the post-war period, the U.S. unemployment rate fell\nbelow the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and has remained\nsignificantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans\nworked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15%\nin agriculture. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and\n30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male unemployment continued\nto be significantly higher than those of females (at 9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009).\nThe unemployment among Caucasians continues being much lower than those for\nAfrican-Americans (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% also in 2009).\n\nThe youth unemployment rate was 18.5% in July 2009, the highest rate in that\nmonth since 1948. The unemployment rate of young African Americans was 28.2%\nin May 2013.\n\nThe unemployment rate reached an all-time high of 14.7% in April 2020 before\nfalling back to 11.1% in June 2020. Due to the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic, Q2 GDP in the US fell 32.9% in 2020. The unemployment rate continued\nits rapid decline falling to 3.9% in 2021. It reached 3.7% in May 2023.",

When measured for all households, U.S. income\ninequality is comparable to other developed countries before taxes and\ntransfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the\nU.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower\nincome households. In 2016, average market income was $15,600 for the lowest\nquintile and $280,300 for the highest quintile. The degree of inequality\naccelerated within the top quintile, with the top 1% at $1.8 million,\napproximately 30 times the $59,300 income of the middle quintile.\n\nThe economic and political impacts of inequality may include slower GDP\ngrowth, reduced income mobility, higher poverty rates, greater usage of\nhousehold debt leading to increased risk of financial crises, and political\npolarization. Causes of inequality may include executive compensation\nincreasing relative to the average worker, financialization, greater industry\nconcentration, lower unionization rates, lower effective tax rates on higher\nincomes, and technology changes that reward higher educational attainment.\n\nMeasurement is debated, as inequality measures vary significantly, for\nexample, across datasets or whether the measurement is taken based on cash\ncompensation (market income) or after taxes and transfer payments. The Gini\ncoefficient is a widely accepted statistic that applies comparisons across\njurisdictions, with a zero indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating\nmaximum inequality. Further, various public and private data sets measure\nthose incomes, e.g., from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Internal\nRevenue Service, and Census. According to the Census Bureau, income inequality\nreached then record levels in 2018, with a Gini of 0.485, Since then the\nCensus Bureau have given values of 0.488 in 2020 and 0.494 in 2021, per pre-\ntax money income.\n\nU.S. tax and transfer policies are progressive and therefore reduce effective\nincome inequality, as rates of tax generally increase as taxable income\nincreases. As a group, the lowest earning workers, especially those with\ndependents, pay no income taxes and may actually receive a small subsidy from\nthe federal government (from child credits and the Earned Income Tax Credit).\nThe 2016 U.S. Gini coefficient was .59 based on market income, but was reduced\nto .42 after taxes and transfers, according to Congressional Budget Office\n(CBO) figures. The top 1% share of market income rose from 9.6% in 1979 to a\npeak of 20.7% in 2007, before falling to 17.5% by 2016.

According to a survey by the federal Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau on the financial well-being of U.S. citizens, roughly half\nhave trouble paying bills, and more than one third have faced hardships such\nas not being able to afford a place to live, running out of food, or not\nhaving enough money to pay for medical care. According to journalist and\nauthor Alissa Quart, the cost of living is rapidly outpacing the growth of\nsalaries and wages, including those for traditionally secure professions such\nas teaching. She writes that \"middle-class life is now 30% more expensive than\nit was 20 years ago.\"\n\nIn February 2019, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that seven\nmillion U.S. citizens are three months or more behind on their car payments,\nsetting a record. This is considered a red flag by economists, that Americans\nare struggling to pay bills in spite of a low unemployment rate. A May 2019\npoll conducted by NPR found that among rural Americans, 40% struggle to pay\nfor healthcare, food and housing, and 49% could not pay cash for a $1,000\nemergency, and would instead choose to borrow in order to pay for such an\nunexpected emergency expense. Some experts assert that the US has experienced\na \"two-tier recovery\", which has benefitted 60% of the population, while the\nother 40% on the \"lower tier\" have been struggling to pay bills as the result\nof stagnant wages, increases in the cost of housing, education and healthcare,\nand growing debts.\n\nA 2021 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that workers\nwould have to make at least $24.90 an hour to be able to afford (meaning 30%\nof a person's income or less) renting a standard two-bedroom home or $20.40\nfor a one-bedroom home anywhere in the US. The former is 3.4 times higher than\nthe current federal minimum wage.\n\nThe USCB reported in September 2023 that incomes fell last year by 2.3% from\n2021, which is the third consecutive year incomes have declined.",

    "text": "Number in poverty and poverty rate: 1959 to 2016. United States.\n\nStarting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those\nof other wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for\ncomparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by\nmarket income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United\nStates, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government\nbenefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011,\nincluding 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high\nlevels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about\n35% more than 2007 levels. As of 2015, 44 percent of children in the United\nStates live with low-income families.\n\nIn 2016, 12.7% of the U.S. population lived in poverty, down from 13.5% in\n2015. The poverty rate rose from 12.5% in 2007 before the Great Recession to a\n15.1% peak in 2010, before falling back to just above the 2007 level. In the\n1959–1962 period, the poverty rate was over 20%, but declined to the all-time\nlow of 11.1% in 1973 following the War on Poverty begun during the Lyndon\nJohnson presidency. In June 2016, The IMF warned the United States that its\nhigh poverty rate needs to be tackled urgently.\n\nWealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013.\n\nThe population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods rose by one third from 2000 to\n2009. People living in such neighborhoods tend to suffer from inadequate\naccess to quality education; higher crime rates; higher rates of physical and\npsychological ailment; limited access to credit and wealth accumulation;\nhigher prices for goods and services; and constrained access to job\nopportunities. As of 2013, 44% of America's poor are considered to be in \"deep\npoverty\", with an income 50% or more below the government's official poverty\nline.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual\nHomeless Assessment Report, as of 2024[update] there were around 771,480\nhomeless people in the United States on a given night, or about 23 of every\n10,000 people. Almost two thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or\ntransitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in\nan abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation. About\n1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency\nshelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008, and\nSeptember 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people are employed. Homelessness\nincreased from 2016 to 2020, along with deaths among the homeless population.\n\nA homeless camp in New Orleans, March 2023\n\nThe United States has one of the least extensive social safety nets in the\ndeveloped world, reducing both relative poverty and absolute poverty by\nconsiderably less than the mean for wealthy nations. Some experts posit that\nthose in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world. A May 2018\nreport by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights\nfound that over five million people in the United States live \"in 'Third\nWorld' conditions\". Poverty is the fourth leading risk factor for premature\ndeath annually, according to a 2023 study published in _JAMA_. Over the last\nthree decades the poor in America have been incarcerated at a much higher rate\nthan their counterparts in other developed nations, with penal confinement\nbeing \"commonplace for poor men of working age\". Some scholars contend that\nthe shift to neoliberal social and economic policies starting in the late\n1970s has expanded the penal state, retrenched the social welfare state,\nderegulated the economy and criminalized poverty, ultimately \"transforming\nwhat it means to be poor in America\".\n\nSociologist Matthew Desmond writes in his 2023 book _Poverty, by America_ that\nthe US \"offers some of the lowest wages in the industrialized world,\" which\nhas \"swelled the ranks of the working poor, most of whom are thirty-five or\nolder.\" Social scientist Mark Robert Rank asserts that the high rates of\npoverty in the U.S. can largely be explained as structural failures at the\neconomic and political levels.",

About 178 million employed by companies\nreceive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million\nother persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized\nmarketplace exchanges developed as part of the Affordable Care Act or directly\nfrom insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the\nexception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the\ngovernment.\n\nMultiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016\ndue to expanded Medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges\nestablished due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known\nas the \"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\". According to the United States Census Bureau, in\n2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65\npopulation) who were without health insurance.

According to the OECD, U.S. healthcare costs in\n2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD\ncountry. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person or\none-third higher relative to the next most expensive country.\n\nThe high cost of health care in the United States is attributed variously to\ntechnological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging\nmore for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in\nother countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact\nof lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the\nfull cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical\ndevices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to\nreceive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a\nnotable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more\nlikely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other\ncountries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to\nthe fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are\nnegotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay\nless than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the\nprivately insured through higher prices.",

Debt held by the public rose considerably as\na result of the Great Recession and its aftermath. It is expected to continue\nrising as the country ages towards 100% GDP by 2028. In February 2024, the\ntotal federal government debt grew to $34.4 trillion after having grown by\napproximately $1 trillion in both of two separate 100-day periods since the\nprevious June.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury statistics indicate that, at the end of 2006, non-US\ncitizens and institutions held 44% of federal debt held by the public. As of\n2014[update], China, holding $1.26 trillion in treasury bonds, is the largest\nforeign financier of the U.S. public debt.\n\nThe overall financial position of the United States as of 2014 includes $269.6\ntrillion of assets owned by households, businesses, and governments within its\nborders, representing more than 15.7 times the annual gross domestic product\nof the United States. Debts owed during this same period amounted to $145.8\ntrillion, about 8.5 times the annual gross domestic product.\n\nSince 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates\non government debt. Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when\nthe market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk,\nor when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies,\npensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or\nchoose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge\nagainst risk. American economist Lawrence Summers argues that at such low\nrates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves\ncreditworthiness.\n\nIn the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their\ndebt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of\nnegative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt\nrates will continue to stay so low. In January 2012, the U.S. Treasury\nBorrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation unanimously recommended that government debt be allowed to auction\neven lower, at negative absolute interest rates.",

    "text": "Number of countries having a banking crisis in each year since 1800. This is\nbased on _This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly_ which\ncovers only seventy countries. The general upward trend might be attributed to\nmany factors. One of these is a gradual increase in the percent of people who\nreceive money for their labor. The dramatic feature of this graph is the\nvirtual absence of banking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods\nagreement, 1945 to 1971. This analysis is similar to Figure 10.1 in Reinhart\nand Rogoff (2009). For more details see the help file for \"bankingCrises\" in\nthe Ecdat package available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n\nThe U.S. federal government regulates private enterprise in numerous ways.\nRegulation falls into two general categories.\n\nSome efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices.\nTraditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated monopolies\nsuch as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would\nensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic\ncontrol to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great\nDepression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural\ngoods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply\nand demand. A number of other industries—trucking and, later,\nairlines—successfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they\nconsidered as harmful price-cutting, a process called regulatory capture.\n\nAnother form of economic regulation, antitrust law, seeks to strengthen market\nforces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The government—and,\nsometimes, private parties—have used antitrust law to prohibit practices or\nmergers that would unduly limit competition.\n\nBank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to other\nG10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S.,\nbanking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has\none of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however,\nmany of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on\nprivacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism,\nanti-usury lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.\n\nSince the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies\nto achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or\nmaintaining a healthy environment. For example, the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration provides and enforces standards for workplace safety,\nand the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides standards and\nregulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides\nstandards of disclosure for food products.\n\nAmerican attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final\nthree decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew\nincreasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the\nexpense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same\ntime, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such\nas telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both\ndevelopments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.\n\nWhile leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally\nfavored economic deregulation during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was\nless agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social\nregulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the\nDepression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the\n1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on\nthe idea that such regulation interfered with free enterprise, increased the\ncosts of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to\nsuch changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about\nspecific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations\nin some areas, including environmental protection.\n\nWhere legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned\nto the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the\n1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco\ncompanies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master\nSettlement Agreement provided states with long-term payments to cover medical\ncosts to treat smoking-related illnesses.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most\nrapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal\nRegistry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001\nto 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically\nsignificant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100\nmillion a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from\n$26.4 billion to $42.7 billion."

Since GDP growth is a function of productivity\n(output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth\nrate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting\nsome of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to\naddress a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging\ntrend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and\nhigher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more\nchildren (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending\n(e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative\nto the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages.

Source:\nUNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.4, based on data from American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science\n\nThe United States has historically been a leader in business R&D and\ninnovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact,\nhowever. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their\ncommitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small\nbusinesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed\nthat, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of\nbusiness 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From\n2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward\ntrajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the\nprevious year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-\nopportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more\nmature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending\nwere in agriculture production: −3.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales\nratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment\nindustry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and\n4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in\n2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth\nrate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be\ncontingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal\nresearch funding and the general business climate."

In 2010, more than one\nquarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts\n(5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas\n(5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%).

This state also\nhosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los\nAngeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are\nthe cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington,\nDC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of\nall jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other\nstate. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share\nreflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business\nfocus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California\nrub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route\n128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous\nhigh-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard\nUniversity and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nNew Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it\nhosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the\nconcentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington\nState has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and\nBoeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are\nlocated in the state of Michigan."

Between 2000 and 2022's edition of the list, the top spot on the Fortune\n500 was occupied by either the auto manufacturer General Motors (GM), the oil\nand gas giant ExxonMobil, or the retailer Walmart. The US is also home of many\nof the world's largest companies by market capitalization; As of February 9,\n2023[update], the largest American companies by market cap are Apple,\nMicrosoft, Google (through holding company Alphabet), Amazon, Berkshire\nHathaway, Tesla, Nvidia, Visa, ExxonMobil, and Meta Platforms. Moreover, many\nof these companies are the most valuable brands, with many of the largest\ncompanies by revenue and market cap on the annual ranking of most valuable\nbrands by Forbes being joined by Coca-Cola, The Walt Disney Company, and\nMcDonald's.\n\nSome industries within America are defined by a few major companies, often\nderiving terms such as \"Big Three\" or \"Big Four\". Examples of this phenomenon\ninclude the Big Three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and\nTransUnion), the Big Three automobile makers (Ford, General Motors, and\nStellantis), the Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and\nPwC), and the Big Four communications carriers (Verizon, AT&T,\nT-Mobile/Sprint, and Dish Network). The American energy industry is among the\nlargest and consists of large companies in oil, natural gas, coal, and\nrenewable energy sources. America's largest energy companies by market are in\noil and gas, with ExxonMobil being joined by Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and\nSchlumberger; British oil companies BP and Shell also have significant\npresence in the United States and trade on both the London Stock Exchange and\nNew York Stock Exchange. Many large American petroleum companies, as well as\nBP, can trace some origin back to Standard Oil, a former monopoly run by John\nD. Rockefeller. In coal, the $30 billion industry is dominated by Peabody\nEnergy, which is the largest coal company in the world with almost $23 billion\nin revenue for 2021. Much of the nation's coal mining occurs in Wyoming and\nAppalachian states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.\n\nA 2012 Deloitte report published in _STORES_ magazine indicated that of the\nworld's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010,\n32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32%\naccounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.\n\nAmerica is the foremost country in the world when it comes to semiconductor\nproduction. In 2011, half of the world's 20 largest semiconductor\nmanufacturers by sales were based in America. More recently, Congress under\nthe presidency of Joe Biden passed a bipartisan bill, the CHIPS and Science\nAct, which bolstered semiconductor production. Some of America's largest\nsemiconductor firms and chip companies are Broadcom, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm.\n\nMany of the United States' largest firms by market cap are technology\ncompanies. These companies are dominated by the Big Five tech giants (Apple,\nAmazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta), though numerous software firms also\ndominate the American technology industry. These firms range from hardware\nmanufacturers like Dell Technologies, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Cisco, to\nsoftware and computing infrastructure programmers like Oracle, Salesforce,\nAdobe, and Intuit.\n\nIn film, American producers create nearly all of the world's highest-grossing\nfilms. Many of the world's best-selling music artists are based in the United\nStates. Some of America's largest media companies are The Walt Disney Company,\nWarner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast, Paramount Global, and Fox."

    "text": "The New York Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange in the world.\n\nMeasured by value of its listed companies' securities, the New York Stock\nExchange is more than three times larger than any other stock exchange in the\nworld. As of October 2008, the combined capitalization of all domestic NYSE\nlisted companies was US$10.1 trillion. NASDAQ is another American stock\nexchange and the world's third-largest exchange after the New York Stock\nExchange and Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange. However, NASDAQ's trade value is\nlarger than Japan's TSE. NASDAQ is the largest electronic screen-based equity\nsecurities trading market in the U.S. With approximately 3,800 companies and\ncorporations, it has more trading volume per hour than any other stock\nexchange.\n\nBecause of the influential role that the U.S. stock market plays in\ninternational finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets\nthat in the short run, stocks that affect the willingness to bear risk\nindependently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most of the variation in\nthe U.S. stock market. In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly\naffected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production\nbetween workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small\nrole in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock\nmarket.\n\nThe U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business\nprofits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance\nindustry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance\nindustry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean\nearnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has\nclosely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income\nearners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose\nfrom $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries\nrose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with\nless than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by\n2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in\nthe U.S., and over 1,800 with more.\n\nTop ten U.S. banks by assets\n\n1 | JP Morgan Chase\n---|---\n2 | Bank of America\n3 | Citigroup\n4 | Wells Fargo\n5 | Goldman Sachs\n6 | Morgan Stanley\n7 | U.S. Bancorp\n8 | Bank of NY Mellon\n9 | HSBC North American Holdings\n10 | Capital One Financial\n\nA 2012 International Monetary Fund study concluded that the U.S. financial\nsector has grown so large that it is slowing economic growth. New York\nUniversity economist Thomas Philippon supported those findings, estimating\nthat the U.S. spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and\nthat the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of\nChicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers in research and\ndevelopment add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry\nworkers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar they are paid. A\nstudy by the Bank for International Settlements reached similar conclusions,\nsaying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and\ndevelopment based industries."
