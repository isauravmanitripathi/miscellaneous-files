    "text": "The **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute\nand per capita terms. As of 2023, Kazakhstan attracted more than US$370\nbillion of foreign investments since becoming an independent republic after\nthe dissolution of the former Soviet Union.\n\nIt possesses oil reserves as well as minerals and metals. Almost every known\nelement on the periodic table can be found in Kazakhstan. It also has\nconsiderable agricultural potential, with its vast steppe lands accommodating\nboth livestock and grain production. The mountains in the south are important\nfor apples and walnuts; both species grow wild there. Kazakhstan's industrial\nsector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of demand for\nKazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp\ndecline of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring\nin 1994. In 1995–97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and\nprivatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into\nthe private sector. Kazakhstan was granted \"market economy country\" status by\nthe European Union and the United States, in 2000 and 2002 respectively.\n\nThe December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to\nbuild a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field through Russia to\nthe Black Sea increased prospects for substantially larger oil exports until\nPutin took issue with the lukewarm support he experienced in the wake of the\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.\nKazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth\ndue to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A bright\nspot in 1999 was the recovery of international petroleum prices, which,\ncombined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest,\npulled the economy out of recession.\n\nGDP per capita shrank by 26% in the 1990s. In the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy\ngrew sharply, aided by increased prices on world markets for Kazakhstan's\nleading exports: oil, metals and grain. GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in\n1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by\n10.6%. Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as\nneighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to\npropel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in\ngovernment finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP\nin 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in\neconomic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of\nthe Russo-Ukrainian War. The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014\nand by 22% in 2015.\n\nIn 2023, the International Institute for Management Development compiled its\nWorld Competitiveness Ranking, ranking Kazakhstan 37th out of 64 countries.\nThe ranking analyzes and ranks countries according to how they manage their\ncompetencies to achieve long-term value creation.\n\nCyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia,\nvisited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during\nthe 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about\nKazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report\n2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide. After 2000,\nthe government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New\nPublic Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and\nincreasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.\n\nKazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional\nranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World\nIntellectual Property Organization.\n\nThe main producer of cotton pulp in Kazakhstan is Khlopkoprom. Judging by a\nnumber of transactions, its products have been supplied to gunpowder\nmanufacturers in the Russian Federation since 2022. Most of the factories that\nimported pulp from Kazakhstan for the manufacture of explosives are under US\nand Ukrainian sanctions. According to OCCRP, Vlast, and iStories, a\nsignificant increase in Kazakhstan's exports of cotton pulp and derivatives to\nthe Russian Federation after February 24, 2022, was identified. Exported\ncomponents are key in the manufacture of explosives and gunpowder. There are\ncontracts for the supply of raw materials to the Kazan Gunpowder Plant from\nKazakhstan until 2026, and to the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant (which also\nproduces gunpowder) until 2024.",

The OECD has recognized the strides the\ngovernment has made in opening the country to international investment and in\nimproving the policy framework for investment as part of their efforts to\ndiversify the economy. In 2017 Kazakhstan was invited by OECD to become\nAdherent to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational\nEnterprises.\n\nAs of 30 September 2014, total foreign investment in Kazakhstan reached\nUS$211.5 billion. Of that total, net foreign Direct Investment constituted\nUS$129.3 billion, with portfolio and other investments comprising the\nremaining US$82.2 billion.\n\nThe FDI growth in Kazakhstan was largely driven by increased investment in\nmining, transport, financial services, telecommunication, and energy that\ncompensated for decreasing investment inflows in construction, metallurgy, and\ntrade. The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov, has stated that\nKazakhstan aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDIs) worth around US$25\nbillion in 2023, adding that 46 projects involving international financial\ninvestments were implemented in the country during 2022 in renewable energy,\nmetallurgy, agriculture, mining industry, and engineering. Kazakhstan's top-10\nFDI donors in 2022 included the Netherlands, the Unitesd States, Switzerland,\nBelgium, Russia, South Korea, China, France, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.\n\nKazakhstan established the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC),\nmodelled on the Dubai International Financial Center, in 2018. The AIFC offers\nforeign investors an alternative jurisdiction for operations, with tax\nholidays, flexible labor rules, a Common Law-based legal system, and\nflexibility to carry out transactions in any currency. The Kazakh government\nrecommends that foreign investors use the AIFC for contracts with Kazakh\nbusinesses.\n\nOver the past five years, the major foreign investors in Kazakhstan have been\nthe Netherlands ($33.8 billion of investment), the United States ($19.4\nbillion), Switzerland ($12.5 billion), China ($ 6.2 billion) and France ($ 4.7\nbillion). Notably, almost 60% of the investment projects are related to non-\nextractive sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, trade, as well as\nfinancial and insurance services. Agriculture is one of Kazakhstan's most\nimportant sectors where the country seeks to attract foreign investments to\nboost the competitiveness of this sector of economy. To that end, in 2017\nKazAgro negotiated with the European Investment Bank (EIB) a €200 million loan\nfor a period of 15 years.\n\n13 Kazakhstan's regions out of 14 saw investment growth in 2020, despite the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. High growth of investment was in the construction sector,\nspecifically in Turkestan region and Zhambyl region as well as Shymkent city.\nThe gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in Kazakhstan reached $28\nbillion in 2022, a record-high in the past ten years. FDI inflow went up by\n17.7 percent since 2021 when it reached $23.8 billion. In 2012, this figure\nstood at $28.9 billion. The Atyrau Region received most of the investment –\n$8.3 billion (a 48.3 percent increase), followed by Almaty city with $7.6\nbillion (10.9 percent), Astana – $2.2 billion (107.2 percent), the East\nKazakhstan Region – $2.2 billion (3.1 percent), and the Aktobe Region – $1.2\nbillion (11.2 percent down).\n\nOne of the main areas for investment is renewable energy, as Kazakhstan has\none of the largest solar and wind potentials in the region. Moreover, it has\nabundant reserves, amounting to 90% of Central Asia's total, of critical raw\nmaterials, which are essential for the deployment of technologies like wind\nturbines (with rare earth magnets), batteries (lithium and cobalt) and\nsemiconductors (polysilicon). In November 2022, the EU had already recognised\nKazakhstan's value for the green transition by signing a strategic partnership\nfor the supply of critical raw materials, as well as green hydrogen.",

    "text": "A new program to support small businesses was launched in Kazakhstan in\nFebruary 2015. 2015 is expected to be a pilot period of the program. During\nthat period the initiative will be focused on three major areas, notably\nagribusiness, machinery building and production of construction materials, and\nis to be further extended to other industries.\n\nIn May 2015 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed\nto provide €41 million for technical cooperation projects, advisory support to\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to introduce a Women in\nBusiness program.\n\nIn 2016 the number of Kazakhstan's telecom start-ups increased by 10% compared\nto 2015. Around 9,400 small telecom companies are currently registered in the\ncountry.\n\nThe Kazakh Government provides extensive support to businesses, especially\nSMEs. The share of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the country's\ngross domestic product grew by 7.9 percent between 2015 and 2021 and reached\n34.7 percent. Kazakhstan plans to raise this indicator to 50% by 2050.\n\nIn 2023, it was reported that the number of small and medium-sized businesses\n(SMEs) in Kazakhstan has increased by 23.4% to nearly two million. The number\nof people working in SMEs increased by more than 18% to 4.1 million,\naccounting for around 40% of everyone employed in the economy.\n\nThe share of SMEs in the economy grew from 33.3% to 36.5%, while the volume of\noutput by SMEs increased by 28% to over 59 trillion tenge ($132.4 billion).\n\nTo expand SMEs’ access to finance, a number of programmes are in place in the\ncountry to provide concessional lending and microfinance, subsidised interest\nrates, loan guarantees and grants to start a business. The main operator of\nfinancial support programmes for SMEs is the Damu Entrepreneurship Development\nFund.\n\n**Government programme for business support and business development “Business\nRoadmap 2025”**\n\n“BRM 2025” programme has been in operation since 2010 and is administered by\nthe Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Initially, the\nfocus of the programme was on supporting enterprises in non-extracting and\nimport-substituting sectors. Over time, this was expanded to rural areas,\nsmall and single-industry towns’ entrepreneurs, who are not subject to\nsectoral restrictions. The programme implementation involves both central and\nlocal authorities, Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund, Atameken National\nChamber of Entrepreneurs and commercial banks. The types of support that the\nprogramme offers include interest rate subsidies, loan guarantees, grants,\ntraining and consulting assistance; and meets the basic needs of\nentrepreneurs, making “BRM 2025” the most popular government programme.\n\n**The programmes of Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund**\n\nDamu Entrepreneurship Development Fund implements a number of its own\nprogrammes, which are financed from the company’s own capital or by raising\nfunds from local authorities and international financial organisations. Within\nthe framework of regional programmes, loans are granted at a rate of up to\n8.0% in priority sectors, which are determined depending on the specifics of\nthe economy of each region. Within the framework of international programmes,\nloans are issued on market terms and without sector restrictions.\n\nIn terms of its own programmes, Damu Fund and its partner organisations\n(banks, leasing companies, microfinance organisations) have financed more than\n55 112 projects for KZT 837 756 million as of the end of 2020.\n\nIn May 2023, Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov said medium-sized businesses\nshould become the engine of progress that drives Kazakhstan’s manufacturing\ngrowth with the launch of competitive products and a wide range of services.\nTo enhance the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs, the government is\nintroducing a regulation-from-scratch mechanism to drop 10,000 unwarranted\nrequirements for businesses and automate processes in all areas of state\ncontrol."
