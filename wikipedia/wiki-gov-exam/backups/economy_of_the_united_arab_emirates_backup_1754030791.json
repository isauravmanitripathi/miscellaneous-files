    "text": "Although the UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's\neconomy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of\nthe UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to\nplay a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of\nthe UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009. While Abu Dhabi and\nother UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to\ndiversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its\ndiversification policy. In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's\nstate budget.\n\nDubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007–2010 and was bailed\nout by Abu Dhabi's oil wealth. Dubai's current [when?] prosperity has been\nattributed to Abu Dhabi's petrodollars. In 2014, Dubai owed a total of $142\nbillion in debt. The UAE government has worked towards reducing the economy's\ndependence on oil exports by 2030. Various projects are underway to help\nachieve this, the most recent being the Khalifa Port, opened in the Emirate of\nAbu Dhabi at the end of 2012. The UAE also won the right to host the World\nExpo 2020, which is believed to have a positive effect on future growth,\nalthough there are some skeptics which mention the opposite.\n\nOver the decades, the Emirate of Dubai has started to look for additional\nsources of revenue. High-class tourism and international finance continue to\nbe developed. In line with this initiative, the Dubai International Financial\nCentre was announced, offering 55.5% foreign ownership, no withholding tax,\nfreehold land and office space and a tailor-made financial regulatory system\nwith laws taken from best practice in other leading financial centers, like\nNew York, London, Zürich and Singapore.[_citation needed_] A new stock market\nfor regional companies and other initiatives was announced in DIFC. Dubai has\nalso developed Internet and Media free zones, offering 100% foreign ownership,\nno tax office space for the world's leading ICT and media companies, with the\nlatest communications infrastructure to service them. Many of the world's\nleading companies have now set up branch offices, and even changed\nheadquarters to, there. Recent [when?] liberalization in the property market\nallowing non-citizens to buy freehold land has resulted in a major boom in the\nconstruction and real estate sectors, with several signature developments,\nsuch as the 2 Palm Islands, the World (archipelago), Dubai Marina, Jumeirah\nLake Towers, and a number of other developments, offering villas and high rise\napartments and office space. Emirates (part of the Emirates Group) was formed\nby the Dubai Government in the 1980s and is presently [when?] one of the few\nairlines to witness strong levels of growth. Emirates is also the largest\noperator of the Airbus A380 aircraft. As of 2001[update], budgeted government\nrevenues were about AED 29.7 billion, and expenditures were about AED 22.9\nbillion. In addition, to finding new ways of sustaining the national economy,\nthe UAE has also made progress in installing new, sustainable methods of\ngenerating electricity. This is evidenced by various solar energy initiatives\nat Masdar City and by other renewable energy developments in parts of the\ncountry.\n\nIn addition, the UAE is starting to see the emergence of local manufacturing\nas new source of economic development, examples of significant government-led\ninvestments, such as Strata in the aerospace industry, under Mubadala, are\nsuccessful, while there are also small scale entrepreneurial ventures picking\nup, such as Zarooq Motors in the automotive industry.\n\nIn August 2020, the Barakah nuclear power plant, the first nuclear power plant\nin the Arab world, became operational.\n\nIn its hard push for economic diversification, the UAE had been increasing its\npresence in Africa. One of the areas of interest had been clean energy, for\nwhich Abu Dhabi’s Masdar built infrastructure, including five wind farms in\nSouth Africa, a battery energy storage system in Senegal and solar power\nfacilities in Mauritania. Emirati companies were also investing in fossil\nfuels, where ADNOC purchased 10% stakes in Mozambique’s Rovuma gas basin.\nUAE’s e& also established a foothold in around 12 countries across Africa. The\nEmirati companies also entered the mining sector, where Tahnoun bin Zayed’s\nInternational Holding Company expressed investment interests in mines in\nKenya, Tanzania and Angola. However, certain investments had also been\ncontroversial. Tanzanian authorities were alleged of forcing several Maasai\noff their land for a safari and hunting project of an Emirati firm. A Dubai-\nbased firm, Blue Carbon, signed preliminary agreements in Liberia, Tanzania,\nKenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, aiming to generate carbon credits. However, it was\naccused of attempting to acquire millions of hectares of African forests in a\ngreenwashing attempt. Meanwhile, DP World also invested around $3bn in Africa,\nand operates ports from Mozambique in the south to Algeria in the north and\nAngola on the Atlantic. The Emirates had also been alleged of controversial\nactions in the war zones in Africa, including in Libya and Sudan.\n\nThe UAE targeted another major milestone in its diversification plans, as it\ngranted a “Commercial Gaming Facility Operator” license to Wynn Resorts in\nOctober 2024. Wynn is developing a $3.9 billion integrated resort, Wynn Al\nMarjan Island, in Ras Al Khaimah, which will also include a 224,000 sq. ft.\ncasino component. Set to open in 2027, the project aims at targeting foreign\ntourists and boosting tourism. Although the UAE established the General\nCommercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA) in September 2023, it has no\nlaws that legalize gambling or its tools and machines. Gambling remains a\ncultural taboo and illegal for local citizens. Despite the casino facility\nbeing constructed in the Emirates, project operators and insiders avoided\ntalking publicly about it."

The top five of the Main Partner Countries of the\nUAE in 2014 are Iran (3.0%), India (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (1.5%), Oman (1.4%)\nand Switzerland (1.2%). As for the top five of UAE suppliers are China (7.4%),\nUnited States (6.4%), India (5.8%), Germany (3.9%) and Japan (3.5%).\n\nUAE's Foreign Trade Indicators  Indicator  | 2010  | 2011  | 2012  | 2013  | 2014\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n**Imports of Goods** _(million USD)_ | 165,000  | 203,000  | 226,000  | 251,000  | 262,000\n**Exports of Goods** _(million USD)_ | 214,000  | 302,000  | 349,000  | 379,000  | 360,000\n**Imports of Services** _(million USD)_ | 41,337  | 55,702  | 62,301  | 66,413  | 70,279\n**Exports of Services** _(million USD)_ | 11,028  | 12,063  | 15,276  | 17,345  | 19,769\n**Imports of Goods and Services** _(Annual % Change)_ | 2.1  | 18.8  | 5.2  | 6.5  | 6.1\n**Exports of Goods and Services** _(Annual % Change)_ | 2.5  | 20.7  | 17.0  | 4.5  | 8.2\n**Imports of Goods and Services** _(in % of GDP)_ | 72.2  | 72.3  | 75.3  | 76.8  | 77.9\n**Exports of Goods and Services** _(in % of GDP)_ | 78.8  | 90.3  | 100.6  | 101.3  | 98.0\n\nIn 2014, the United Arab Emirates managed to export 380.4bn dominated by four\nproducts which are [1] (19.8%) Diamonds, whether or not worked, but not\nmounted...

On the other hand, it imported 63.9 bn\nUSD of services imported services dominated by transportation (70.68%), travel\n(27.70%) and government services (1.62%).\n\nIn September 2021, the UAE announced its plans to aggravate its trade ties\nwith other economies, particularly in Asia and Africa. The country indicated\nthat it was looking for inward foreign investments of around $150 billion in\nthe next nine years, that is, by 2030. The Emirates aimed to be one of the\nworld’s ten biggest investment nations. However, it had to face strong\ncompetition from its neighbor, Saudi Arabia, creating a broader gap in the\nonce-assumed alliance between the two countries. The Emirati minister of state\nfor foreign trade said, \"Let the Saudis increase the competition. It means the\npie is going to be bigger and having a bigger pie means that the UAE share out\nof this pie is going to be bigger.\"\n\nThe EU identified that the Emirati firms were involved in direct trade of\nweapon components to Russia. The EU sanctions targeted two UAE-based\ncompanies, I Jet Global and Success Aviation Services, which were exporting\ndual-use goods. The EU warned that countries that will be used for Russia’s\nbenefit could face a total ban on imports from the EU military and high tech\nkit. Besides, a trade war with UAE was expected, if it continued trade with\nRussia.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has introduced significant changes to its regulations\nconcerning the promotion and distribution of foreign investment funds within\nthe country. As part of these changes, encapsulated in several decisions by\nthe Securities and Commodities Authority, is that foreign-owned funds can no\nlonger directly advertise or distribute units publicly in the UAE. Instead,\nthese activities are confined to private distribution aimed at Professional\nInvestors and/or Market Counterparties. This shift signifies a strategic move\nto tighten the circumstances under which foreign funds can interact with UAE-\nbased investors, particularly Retail Customers and Professional Investors,\nunderscoring a push towards a more regulated investment environment.\n\nThese regulatory updates have also led to changes in the distribution to\nProfessional Investors, as they are now no longer exempt under the Securities\nand Commodities Authority Rulebook. Only firms licensed by the SCA to conduct\nthe regulated activity of \"Promotion\" are now permitted to promote such funds,\nand only on a private placement basis. Furthermore, the promotion or\ndistribution of foreign funds to retail investors is outright prohibited,\nalthough reverse solicitation from retail investors is not prohibited in\nitself. All foreign funds to be distributed in the UAE must be registered with\nthe SCA, barring those that can prove documented reverse solicitation.\n\nThree Emirati companies were found involved in trade of Iranian petroleum or\npetrochemical products, and were sanctioned by the US State Department in June\n2024. One of the companies was Sea Route Ship Management FZE, which engaged in\ntransport of Iranian petrochemical products as the commercial manager of the\nvessel ASTRA. The other two firms, Almanac Ship Management LLC and Al Anchor\nShip Management FZE were involved in transport of Iranian petroleum products\nas the commercial manager of the vessels BERENICE PRIDE and PARINE\nrespectively.\n\nIn July 2024, Samco Petroleum Energy FZE, located in Hamriyah Free Zone, was\nput up for sale for $17.7 million, with a promise to provide a turnkey oil\ntrading operation. The sale emerged amidst the US sanctions imposed on several\noil traders in the UAE's free trade zones, particularly Hamriyah, for\ncontinuing business with Iran and Russia. In November 2023, OFAC sanctioned a\ndozen companies in various UAE’s free zones for facilitating the sale of\nIranian products in third countries through Sepehr Energy, which is affiliated\nwith Iran's Armed Forces General Staff. In March 2023, more companies\noperating in the UAE were sanctioned for exporting petrochemical products from\nIran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries to India and Southeast Asia. The\nEmirati authorities were also pushed to halt Russian imports and exports via\nDubai.\n\nIn September 2024, the UAE and Australia agreed on a free trade deal, which\nwas expected to increase investment in Australia’s significant mineral and\nclean energy sectors. The deal was to eliminate tariffs on imports of over 99%\nof Australian goods. However, Australian unions criticized the deal,\nhighlighting the UAE's poor human rights and labor record, including modern\nslavery under the kafala system. Michele O'Neil also expressed concerns\nregarding the exploitation of migrant workers in the UAE, calling it one of\nthe most repressive regimes with which Australia has entered into a bilateral\ntrade deal."

On 17 June 2008, there\nwere about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the Burj Khalifa construction\nsite. Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site\nearned £4.34 a day, and labourers earned £2.84. According to a BBC\ninvestigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in\nabysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay. During construction,\nonly one construction-related death was reported. However, workplace injuries\nand fatalities in the UAE are \"poorly documented\", according to Human Rights\nWatch.\n\nIn March 2006 about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the\nend of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices,\ncomputers and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said\nthe rioters caused almost £500,000 in damage. Most of the workers involved in\nthe riot returned the following day but refused to work. Workers at Dubai\nairport also protested."

    "text": "Two blue-collar workers posing for a picture with Burj Khalifa on the\nbackground\n\nEmiratisation is an initiative by the government of the UAE to employ more UAE\nNationals in a meaningful and efficient manner in the public and private\nsectors. While the program has been in place for more than a decade and\nresults can be seen in the public sector, the private sector is still lagging\nbehind with citizens only representing 0.34% of the private sector workforce.\n\nWhile there is general agreement over the importance of Emiratisation for\nsocial, economic and political reasons, there is also some contention as to\nthe impact of localization on organizational efficiency. It is yet unknown\nwhether, and the extent to which, employment of nationals generates returns\nfor MNEs operating in the Middle East. Recent research cautions that\nlocalization is not always advantageous for firms operating in the region, and\nits effectiveness depends on a number of contingent factors.\n\nIn December 2009 however, a positive impact of UAE citizens in the workplace\nwas identified in a newspaper article citing a yet unpublished study, this\nadvantage being the use of networks within the evolving power structures.\n\nOverall, however, uptake in the private sector remains low regardless of\nsignificant investments in education, which have reached record levels with\neducation now accounting for 22.5% – or $2.6 billion – of the overall budget\nplanned for 2010. Multiple governmental initiatives are actively promoting\nEmiratisation by training anyone from high school dropouts to graduates in a\nmultitude of skills needed for the – essentially Western – work environment of\nthe UAE, these initiatives include Tawteen UAE, ENDP or the Abu Dhabi Tawteen\nCouncil.\n\nThere are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with\nEmiratis – and other GCC nationals – being given preference when it comes to\nemployment. Unions are generally banned and workers with any labour issues are\nadvised to be in touch with the Ministry of Labour, instead of protesting or\nrefusing to work. Migrant employees often complain of poor workplace safety\nand wages based on nationality, although this is being slowly addressed.\n\nBeyond directly sponsoring educational initiatives, the Emirates Foundation\nfor Philanthropy is funding major research initiatives into Emiratisation\nthrough competitive research grants, allowing universities such as United Arab\nEmirates University or Dubai School of Government to build and disseminate\nexpertise on the topic.\n\nAcademics working on various aspects of Emiratisation include _Paul Dyer_[12]\nand _Natasha Ridge_ from Dubai School of Government, _Ingo Forstenlechner_[13]\nfrom United Arab Emirates University, _Kasim Randaree_ from the British\nUniversity of Dubai and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.\n\nIn 2020, economy of the United Arab Emirates became vulnerable to the COVID-19\npandemic, witnessing an economic shutdown. Among the Emirates, Dubai was\nfacing extreme situation, where the expat workers were left jobless. Thousands\nof the Britons working in the city started selling off their possessions to\ncollect money, as the strict visa regulations forced them to return to the UK.\n\nAccording to an April 2021 report published by the Democracy Centre for\nTransparency on the _Discrimination against foreigners and expatriates living\nin the UAE versus Emirati citizens_ , despite labor reforms in the UAE,\nforeigners and skilled or unskilled migrant workers face discrimination and\nracialization[_clarification needed_] from the citizens of the country.\nForeigners and expatriates are often subjected to discrimination at work\nconcerning promotions and wages, or gender inequality. The findings of the DCT\nconcern the organization as the UAE’s economy largely relies on foreign\nworkers and thus fulfills a crucial international role. The organization\ndemands that the UAE abide by universal human rights principles.\n\nThe 31st edition of World Report 2021 released by Human Rights Watch\nreiterates that labour abuses driven by an exploitative kafala system are\npersistent in the UAE. During the Covid-19 pandemic, migrant workers faced\nmassive unemployment issues and were also left stranded in dire conditions\nwithout legal residencies. Also, many migrants suffered wage theft and were\nunable to pay rent or buy food."

The change was due\nto \"the potential material weakening in their standalone credit profiles\",\nwhere the UAE's economy was facing additional challenges amidst the COVID-19\npandemic and low oil prices. The eight banks included Abu Dhabi Commercial\nBank, Emirates NBD, HSBC Bank Middle East, Dubai Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi\nIslamic Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, National Bank of Ras al-Khaimah and\nMashreq Bank.\n\nThe Fitch Ratings in its 22 June 2020 report predicted that the Standalone\nCredit Profiles of UAE-based banks are to possibly weaken in the following\nyear due to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price collapse. As per the Fitch\nreport, despite the implementation of timely measures for supporting the\neconomy, the profitability of banks in the UAE are prone to get affected by a\nlower non-interest income worsened by a controlled business volume, lower\ninterest rates, and higher loan recovery charges. In addition, the asset\nquality is expected to weaken, too, following the unbearable impact of the\neconomic downturn that all borrowers may not be able to withstand."
