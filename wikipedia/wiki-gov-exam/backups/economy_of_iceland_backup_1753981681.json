    "text": "The **economy of Iceland** is small and subject to high volatility. In 2011,\nthe gross domestic product was US$12 billion, but by 2018 it had increased to\na nominal GDP of US$27 billion. With a population of 387,000, this is $55,000\nper capita, based on purchasing power parity (PPP) estimates. The 2008–2011\nIcelandic financial crisis produced a decline in GDP and employment, which has\nsince been reversed entirely by a recovery aided by a tourism boom starting in\n2010. Tourism accounted for more than 10% of Iceland's GDP in 2017. After a\nperiod of robust growth, Iceland's economy slowed down according to an\neconomic outlook for the years 2018–2020 published by Arion Research in April\nof 2018.\n\nIceland has a mixed economy with high levels of free trade and government\nintervention. However, government consumption is less than other Nordic\ncountries. Hydro-power is the primary source of home and industrial electrical\nsupply in Iceland.\n\nIn the 1990s Iceland undertook extensive free market reforms, which initially\nproduced strong economic growth. As a result, Iceland was rated as having one\nof the world's highest levels of economic freedom as well as civil freedoms.\nIn 2007, Iceland topped the list of nations ranked by Human Development Index\nand was one of the most egalitarian, according to the calculation provided by\nthe Gini coefficient.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, the economy faced problems of growing inflation and current\naccount deficits. Partly in response, and partly as a result of earlier\nreforms, the financial system expanded rapidly before collapsing entirely in\nthe 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis. Iceland had to obtain emergency\nfunding from the International Monetary Fund and a range of European countries\nin November 2008.

The\ntraditional nationalistic historical narrative says that Iceland had\nexperienced a golden age from 874 until the 11th century, when the country\ncame under foreign rule and \"suffered humiliation\" as its economy declined.\nThere is very little evidence to support this narrative.\n\nIceland had among the lowest GDP per capita out of all the Western European\ncountries at the start of the 20th century. An assessment by economists at the\nCentral Bank of Iceland stated that the country's \"post-World War II economic\ngrowth has been both significantly higher and more volatile than in other OECD\ncountries\", and that \"the Icelandic business cycle has been largely\nindependent of the business cycle in other industrialised countries.\" Iceland\nhas had a total of twenty financial crashes since 1875, according to Reuters.\n\nFishing became a large part of the Icelandic economy after the 1880s, partly\ndue to expanded fishing with sailing smacks. During the Second World War, the\nUK imposed trade sanctions on Iceland to prevent them from trading with\nGermany. After the British and later American occupations of the island, the\neconomy was boosted by a substantial amount, and Iceland went from one of the\npoorest countries in Europe to one of the wealthiest. This was furthered by\nIceland being included as part of the post-WWII Marshall Plan, receiving the\nlargest amount per capita between 1948 and 1951, almost double the amount of\nthe next highest recipient.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, Iceland's economy continued to grow. A\ncoalition between the Independence and Progressive parties led to the\nprivatization of state-owned banks and telecommunications. Corporate income\ntax was reduced to 18%, inheritance tax was greatly reduced, and the net\nwealth tax was completely abolished. The term \"Nordic Tiger\" became heavily\nused refer to the period of economic prosperity in Iceland that began in the\n1990s.\n\nThe \"Nordic Tiger\" period came to a sudden end as a result of the 2008\nfinancial crisis. Iceland went from being the 10th richest country in the\nworld in 2007 to the 21st in 2010. Banks made risky loans and manipulated\nmarkets, with the country's regulators understaffed and not properly\nsupervising them. The Icelandic króna underwent sharp inflation, with the\nthree largest banks in the country being placed under government control.\nIceland's central bank raised its interest rate to 18% in an attempt to combat\nthe inflation.\n\nWith help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Iceland's economy\nstabilized and managed to pay off all of its loans by the end of 2015.\nEconomists Ásgeir Jónsson and Hersir Sigurjónsson said that \"Iceland was\ntreated differently from developing countries and former IMF clients. There\nwas no call for Iceland to adopt sharp austerity measures at the inception of\nthe joint economic plan. Instead, the government would be allowed to maintain\nlarge public deficits in the first year – 2009 – allowing fiscal multipliers\nto counteract the output contraction that was underway. Iceland also was not\nasked to downsize its Scandinavian-type welfare system.\"",

The plant, known as _Fjardaál_ (or \"aluminium of the fjords\"),\nhas a capacity of 346,000 t/yr and was put into operation in April 2008. To\npower the plant, Landsvirkjun built Kárahnjúkar, a 690-MW hydropower station.\nThe project was enormous in the context of the Icelandic economy, increasing\ntotal installed electric power capacity from under 1,600 MW to around 2,300\nMW.\n\nAlcoa's aluminium plant in Reyðarfjörður, Iceland\n\nAccording to Alcoa, construction of Fjardaál entailed no human displacement,\nno impact on endangered species, and no danger to commercial fisheries; there\nwill also be no significant effect on reindeer, bird and seal populations.\nHowever, the project drew considerable opposition from environmentalist groups\nsuch as the World Wide Fund for Nature, which called on Alcoa to abandon the\nplan to build Fjardaál.

The fisheries sector directly employs around 9,000 people (4,900 in\nfishing and 4,100 in fish processing; approximately 5 per cent of Iceland's\nworkforce), although it is estimated that a total of between 25,000 and 35,000\npeople (up to 20 per cent of the workforce) depend on the ocean cluster for\ntheir livelihood. Many of these jobs are provided by technological companies\nthat manufacture equipment for fisheries firms and by companies engaged in the\nadvanced processing of marine products or in biotechnical production. By\ncontrast, aquaculture remains a very small industry in Iceland, employing only\naround 250 people for a production of 5,000 tonnes.\n\nIceland is the second biggest fisheries nation in the North East Atlantic\nbehind Norway, having overtaken the United Kingdom in the early 1990s. Since\n2006, Icelandic fishing waters have yielded a total catch of between 1.1m and\n1.4m tonnes of fish annually, although this is down from a peak of over 2m\ntonnes in 2003.\n\nCod remains the most important species harvested by Icelandic fisheries, with\na total catch of 178,516 tonnes in 2010. The catch of cod has stagnated in\nrecent years due to quotas, and was supplemented by the catch of blue whiting,\nwhich is used mainly for processing. The Icelandic catch of this previously\ninsignificant fish increased from a negligible 369 tonnes in 1995 to a peak of\n501,505 tonnes in 2003. Subsequently, the stock showed signs of instability\nand quotas were reduced, leading to a decline in the catch to 87,121 tonnes in\n2010. There have been increased numbers of Atlantic mackerel (the \"Miracle of\nthe Mackerel\") in the 21st century as the Atlantic Ocean has slightly warmed.",

    "text": "The currency of Iceland is the _króna_ (plural: _krónur_), issued exclusively\nby the Central Bank of Iceland since the bank's founding in 1961. Iceland is\nthe least populous country to have its own currency and monetary policy.\n\nExchange rate for the krona to the euro from 2000 to mid-2010\n\nDuring the 1970s the oil shocks (1973 and 1979 energy crisis) hit Iceland\nhard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987\nbut rising to 30% in 1988. Iceland experienced moderately strong GDP growth\n(3% on average) from 1995 to 2004. Growth slowed between 2000 and 2002, but\nthe economy expanded by 4.3% in 2003 and grew by 6.2% in 2004. Growth in 2005\nexceeded 6%. Inflation averaged merely 1.5% from 1993 to 1994, and only 1.7%\nfrom 1994 to 1995. Inflation over 2006 topped at 8.6%, with a rate of 6.9% as\nof January 2007. Standard & Poor's reduced their rating for Iceland to AA−\nfrom A+ (long term) in December 2006, following a loosening of fiscal policy\nby the Icelandic government ahead of the 2007 elections. Foreign debt rose to\nmore than five times the value of Iceland's GDP, and Iceland's Central Bank\nraised short-term interest rates to nearly 15% in 2007. Due to the plunging\ncurrency against the euro and dollar, in 2008 inflation was speculated to be\nat 20-25%.\n\nInflation increased during the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, and the\nCentral Bank of Iceland pegged the krona's value to the euro at increasingly\nhigher and higher rates in an attempt to keep the currency stable, eventually\npegging it at 340 kronur per euro before all trade in the currency was\nsuspended. The krona similarly fell in value against the US dollar, going from\naround 50–80 per dollar to about 110–115 per dollar. By November 2008, it had\ncontinued to lower to 135 to the dollar. By early April 2009, the value\nhovered around 119 per dollar, roughly maintaining that value over the next\ntwo years. The currency has stabalized since the crisis, with 1 US$ being\nworth 137.22 Icelandic kronur in September 2024.\n\nDespite being heavily integrated into European Union via the European Economic\nArea (EEA) and the Schengen Agreement, Iceland does not use the euro. Then-\nDeputy Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland, Arnór Sighvatsson, said that\nIceland would not adopt the euro \"as it entails extra cost of purchase of new\nbase money for the banking system and larger precautionary foreign exchange\nreserves."
