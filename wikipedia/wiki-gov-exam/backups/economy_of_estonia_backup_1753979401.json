    "text": "The **economy of Estonia** is rated advanced by the World Bank, i.e. with high\nquality of life and advanced infrastructure relative to less industrialized\nnations. Estonia is a member of the European Union, the eurozone, and the\nOECD. The economy is heavily influenced by developments in the Finnish and\nSwedish economies.\n\nAfter Estonia restored its independence in 1991 and became a market economy,\nit emerged as a pioneer in the global economy. Estonia styled itself as a\nbridge between East and West, adopting significant economic reforms and\ntechnological innovations. In 1992, the country adopted the Estonian kroon as\nits currency, this stabilised the economy. In 1994, it became the first\ncountry in the world to adopt a flat tax, with a rate of 26% regardless of\npersonal income. Estonia received more foreign investment, per person, in the\nlate 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe. The country\nhas been catching-up with the EU-15 \\- the richer European countries. Its GDP\nper capita grew from 35% of the EU-15 average in 1996 to 65% in 2007, similar\nto Central European countries. GDP per capita (current US$) was $30,133 in\n2023 according to the World Bank; this was between the Czech Republic and\nBahrain, but below Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor Estonia, the 2008 financial crisis was easier to weather, because its\nbudget has consistently been kept balanced, and this meant public debt\nrelative to GDP remained the lowest in Europe. The economy recovered in 2010.\nIn January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro, joining the eurozone. Estonia has\ndemonstrated resilience, with a strong service sector, particularly in IT due\nto the Tiigrihüpe project, and advanced e-government services. Estonia's\ncommitment to a circular economy, innovation and its success in maintaining a\nbalanced budget, low public debt, and a competitive tax system have positioned\nit as a model of economic reform and growth in post-Soviet Europe.",

Despite\nconsiderable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first\ndecade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist\nruble was replaced by the Estonian mark, which was in circulation until 1927.\nBy 1929, a stable currency, the kroon, had been established. It was issued by\nthe Bank of Estonia, the country's central bank. Compensating the German\nlandowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and\ndivided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian\nprosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly\nGermany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR.\n\nHistorically, Estonia's economy was agricultural, modernising significantly\npost-independence from Russia in 1918. There was a notable knowledge sector in\nTartu and expanding industrial sector, exemplified by the Kreenholm\nManufacturing Company. Western European markets were familiar with Estonian\ndairy, with the main trade partners being Germany and the UK; only 3% of\ncommerce was with the neighbouring USSR. Estonia and Finland had a similar\nstandard of living. USSR's annexation of Estonia in 1940 and destruction\nduring World War II crippled the economy.

In December 2008, Estonia\nbecame a donor country to the IMF-led rescue package for Latvia. In response\nto the crisis, the Ansip government opted for fiscal consolidation and\nretrenchment by maintaining fiscal discipline and a balanced budget in\ncombination with austerity packages: The government increased taxes, and\nreduced public spending by slashing expenditures and public salaries across\nthe board.\n\nAfter a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased.\nIn the first quarter 2008, GDP grew only 0.1%, and then decreased: negative\ngrowth was −1.4% in the 2nd quarter, a little over −3% (on a year-to-year\nbasis) in the 3rd quarter, and −9.4% in the 4th quarter of that year.\n\nThe government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by the\nRiigikogu. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1 billion\nand the expenditure by EEK 3.2 billion. A current account-deficit was extant,\nbut began to shrink in late 2008. In 2009, the economy further contracted by\n15% in the first quarter. Low domestic and foreign demand depressed the\neconomy's overall output. The economy's 34% industrial production drop was the\nsharpest decrease in industrial production in the European Union. Estonia was\none of the five worst-performing economies in the world in terms of annual\ngrowth, and had one of the hightest rates of unemployment in the EU, which\nrose from 4% in May 2008 to 16% in May 2009.\n\nIn July 2009, the value-added tax was increased from 18% to 20%. The recorded\nbudget deficit for 2009 was just 1.7% of GDP. The result was, that Estonia was\none of only five EU countries in 2009 that met the Maastricht criteria for\ndebt and deficit, and had the third-lowest deficit after Luxembourg and\nSweden; Estonia did not ask for support from the IMF. Despite the third-\nlargest drop in GDP, the country had the lowest budget deficit and lowest\npublic debt among Central and Eastern European countries. In 2009, the\nEstonian economy began to rebound, and economic growth resumed in the second\nhalf of 2010. The country's unemployment rate dropped significantly to pre-\nrecession levels.
