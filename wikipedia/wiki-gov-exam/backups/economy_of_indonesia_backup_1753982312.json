    "text": "The **economy of Indonesia** is a mixed economy with dirigiste\ncharacteristics, and it is one of the emerging market economies in the world\nand the largest in Southeast Asia. As an upper-middle income country and\nmember of the G20, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country.\nIndonesia nominal GDP reached 22.139 quadrillion rupiah in 2024, it is the\n16th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the 7th largest in terms\nof GDP (PPP). Indonesia's internet economy reached US$77 billion in 2022, and\nis expected to cross the US$130 billion mark by 2025.\n\nIndonesia depends on the domestic market and government budget spending and\nits ownership of state-owned enterprises (the central government owns 844\ncompanies). Indonesian state-owned companies have assets valued at more than 1\ntrillion USD as of 2024.\n\nThe administration of prices of a range of basic goods (including rice and\nelectricity) also plays a significant role in Indonesia's market economy.\nHowever, a mix of micro, medium and small companies contribute around 61.7% of\nthe economy and significant major private-owned companies and foreign\ncompanies are also present.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the government took\ncustody of a significant portion of private sector assets through the\nacquisition of nonperforming bank loans and corporate assets through the debt\nrestructuring process, and the companies in custody were sold for\nprivatization several years later. Since 1999, the economy has recovered, and\ngrowth accelerated to over 4–6% in the early 2000s. In 2012, Indonesia was the\nsecond fastest-growing G20 economy, behind China, and the annual growth rate\nfluctuated around 5% in the following years. Indonesia faced a recession in\n2020 when the economic growth collapsed to −2.07% due to the COVID-19\npandemic, its worst economic performance since the 1997 crisis.\n\nIn 2022, gross domestic product expanded by 5.31%, due to the removal of\nCOVID-19 restrictions as well as record-high exports driven by stronger\ncommodity prices.\n\nIndonesia is predicted to be the 4th largest economy in the world by 2045.\nJoko Widodo (Jokowi) has stated that his cabinet's calculations showed that by\n2045, Indonesia will have a population of 309 million people. By Jokowi's\nestimate, there would be economic growth of 5−6% and GDP of US$9.1 trillion.\nIndonesia's GDP per capita is expected to reach US$29,000.",

    "text": "In the years immediately following the proclamation of Indonesian\nindependence, both the Japanese occupation and the conflict between Dutch and\nRepublican forces had crippled the country's production, with exports of\ncommodities such as rubber and oil being reduced to 12 and 5% of their pre-WW2\nlevels, respectively. The first Republican government-controlled bank, the\nIndonesian State Bank (_Bank Negara Indonesia_ , BNI) was founded on 5 July\n1946. It initially acted as the manufacturer and distributor of ORI (_Oeang\nRepublik Indonesia_ /Money of the Republic of Indonesia), a currency issued by\nthe Republican Government which was the predecessor of Rupiah. Despite this,\ncurrency issued during the Japanese occupation and by Dutch authorities was\nstill in circulation, and the simplicity of the ORI made its counterfeiting\nrelatively easy, worsening matters. Between 1949 and 1960, Indonesia\nexperienced several economic disruptions. The country's independence\nrecognized by the Netherlands, the dissolution of the United States of\nIndonesia in 1950, the subsequent liberal democracy period, the\nnationalization of _De Javasche Bank_ into the modern Bank Indonesia, and the\ntakeover of Dutch corporate assets following the West New Guinea dispute,\nwhich all resulted in the devaluation of Dutch banknotes into half their\nvalue.\n\nDuring the guided democracy era in the 1960s, the economy deteriorated\ndrastically as a result of political instability. The government was\ninexperienced in implementing macroeconomic policies, which resulted in severe\npoverty and hunger. By the time of Sukarno's downfall in the mid-1960s, the\neconomy was in chaos with 1,000% annual inflation, shrinking export revenues,\ncrumbling infrastructure, factories operating at minimal capacity, and\nnegligible investment. Nevertheless, Indonesia's post-1960 economic\nimprovement was considered remarkable when taking into consideration how few\nindigenous Indonesians in the 1950s had received a formal education under\nDutch colonial policies.",

    "text": "Following President Sukarno's downfall, the New Order administration brought a\ndegree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down,\nstabilized the currency, rescheduled foreign debt, and attracted foreign aid\nand investment. (See Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia and Berkeley\nMafia). Indonesia was until recently Southeast Asia's only member of OPEC, and\nthe 1970s oil price rise provided an export revenue windfall that contributed\nto sustained high economic growth rates, averaging over 7% from 1968 to 1981.\n\nWith high levels of regulation and dependence on declining oil prices, growth\nslowed to an average of 4.5% per annum between 1981 and 1988. A range of\neconomic reforms was introduced in the late 1980s, including a managed\ndevaluation of the rupiah to improve export competitiveness, and deregulation\nof the financial sector. Foreign investment flowed into Indonesia,\nparticularly into the rapidly developing export-oriented manufacturing sector,\nand from 1989 to 1997, the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7%.\nGDP per capita grew 545% from 1970 to 1980 as a result of the sudden increase\nin oil export revenues from 1973 to 1979. High levels of economic growth\nmasked several structural weaknesses in the economy. It came at a high cost in\nterms of weak and corrupt governmental institutions, severe public\nindebtedness through mismanagement of the financial sector, rapid depletion of\nnatural resources, and culture of favors and corruption in the business elite.\n\nCorruption particularly gained momentum in the 1990s, reaching to the highest\nlevels of the political hierarchy as Suharto became the most corrupt leader\naccording to Transparency International. As a result, the legal system was\nweak, and there was no effective way to enforce contracts, collect debts, or\nsue for bankruptcy. Banking practices were very unsophisticated, with\ncollateral-based lending the norm and widespread violation of prudential\nregulations, including limits on connected lending. Non-tariff barriers, rent-\nseeking by state-owned enterprises, domestic subsidies, barriers to domestic\ntrade and export restrictions all created economic distortions.\n\nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis that began to affect Indonesia became an\neconomic and political crisis. The initial response was to float the rupiah,\nraise key domestic interest rates, and tighten fiscal policy. In October 1997,\nIndonesia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached an agreement on an\neconomic reform program aimed at macroeconomic stabilization and the\nelimination of some of the country's most damaging economic policies, such as\nthe National Car Program and the clove monopoly, both involving family members\nof Suharto. The rupiah remained weak, however, and Suharto was forced to\nresign in May 1998 after massive riots erupted. In August 1998, Indonesia and\nthe IMF agreed on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) under President B. J.\nHabibie that included significant structural reform targets. President\nAbdurrahman Wahid took office in October 1999, and Indonesia and the IMF\nsigned another EFF in January 2000. The new program also has a range of\neconomic, structural reform, and governance targets.\n\nThe effects of the crisis were severe. By November 1997, rapid currency\ndepreciation had seen public debt reach US$60 billion, imposing severe strains\non the government's budget. In 1998, real GDP contracted by 13.1%, and the\neconomy reached its low point in mid-1999 with 0.8% real GDP growth. Inflation\nreached 72% in 1998 but slowed to 2% in 1999. The rupiah, which had been in\nthe RP 2,600/USD1 range at the start of August 1997 fell to 11,000/USD1 by\nJanuary 1998, with spot rates around 15,000 for brief periods during the first\nhalf of 1998. It returned to the 8,000/USD1 range at the end of 1998 and has\ngenerally traded in the Rp 8,000–10,000/USD1 range ever since, with\nfluctuations that are relatively predictable and gradual. However, the rupiah\nbegan devaluing past 11,000 in 2013, and as of November 2016 is around 13,000\nRp/USD1.",

    "text": "Since an inflation target was introduced in 2000, the GDP deflator and the CPI\nhave grown at an average annual pace of 10¾% and 9%, respectively, similar to\nthe pace recorded in the two decades prior to the 1997 crisis, but well below\nthe pace in the 1960s and 1970s. Inflation has also generally trended lower\nthrough the 2000s, with some of the fluctuations in inflation reflecting\ngovernment policy initiatives such as the changes in fiscal subsidies in 2005\nand 2008, which caused large temporary spikes in CPI growth.\n\nHistorical GDP per capita development of Indonesia Share of world GDP (PPP)\n---\nYear  | Share\n1980 | 1.24%\n1990 | 1.68%\n2000  | 1.7%\n2010  | 2.07%\n2020  | 2.31%\n2025  | 2.42%\n\nIn late 2004, Indonesia faced a 'mini-crisis' due to international oil prices\nrises and imports. The currency exchange rate reached Rp 12,000/USD1 before\nstabilizing. Under President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), the government\nwas forced to cut its massive fuel subsidies, which were planned to cost $14\nbillion in October 2005.\n\nAs of February 2007, the unemployment rate was 9.75%. Despite a slowing global\neconomy, Indonesia's economic growth accelerated to a ten-year high of 6.3% in\n2007. This growth rate was sufficient to reduce poverty from 17.8% to 16.6%\nbased on the government's poverty line and reversed the recent trend towards\njobless growth, with unemployment falling to 8.46% in February 2008. Unlike\nmany of its more export-dependent neighbors, Indonesia has managed to skirt\nthe recession helped by strong domestic demand (which makes up about two-\nthirds of the economy) and a government fiscal stimulus package of about 1.4%\nof GDP. After India and China, Indonesia was the third-fastest growing economy\nin the G20. With the $512 billion economy expanded 4.4% in the first quarter\nfrom a year earlier and last month, the IMF revised its 2009 Indonesia\nforecast to 3–4% from 2.5%. Indonesia enjoyed stronger fundamentals with the\nauthorities implemented wide-ranging economic and financial reforms, including\na rapid reduction in public and external debt, strengthening of corporate and\nbanking sector balance sheets and reducing bank vulnerabilities through higher\ncapitalization and better supervision.\n\nIn 2012, Indonesia's real GDP growth reached 6%, then it steadily decreased\nbelow 5% until 2015. After Joko Widodo succeeded SBY, the government took\nmeasures to ease regulations for foreign direct investments to stimulate the\neconomy. Indonesia managed to increase their GDP growth slightly above 5% in\n2016–2017. However, the government is currently still facing problems such as\ncurrency weakening, decreasing exports and stagnating consumer spending. The\ncurrent unemployment rate for 2019 is at 5.3%.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Indonesia's economy faced significant challenges due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The country's GDP contracted by 2.1% in 2020, marking\nits first annual decline in over two decades. This downturn was attributed to\nstrict public health measures, including large-scale social restrictions\n(PSBB), which disrupted economic activities, particularly in major urban\ncenters like Jakarta and West Java. Despite these challenges, the government\nimplemented fiscal stimulus packages and social assistance programs to\nmitigate the pandemic's impact on vulnerable populations. By the third quarter\nof 2020, signs of recovery emerged, with the pace of economic contraction\nslowing to 3.5% year-over-year, driven by a partial rebound in consumption and\ninvestment.\n\nIn 2021, Indonesia's economy began to recover, recording a growth rate of\n4.4%, supported by improved domestic demand and positive spillovers from a\nstronger global economy. The recovery was further bolstered by the\ngovernment's efforts to accelerate the COVID-19 vaccination rollout and\nimplement policies aimed at boosting economic activity. Growth accelerated to\n5.0% in 2022, driven by reduced uncertainty and the assumption that the\nvaccine rollout would reach a critical mass of the population.\n\nIn October 2024, Prabowo Subianto assumed the presidency, inheriting an\neconomy with steady growth but facing structural challenges. His\nadministration introduced ambitious policies aimed at boosting economic growth\nto 8%, including a $28 billion annual free school meals program and plans to\nretire all fossil fuel power plants within 15 years. To fund these\ninitiatives, the government implemented significant budget cuts totaling $18.8\nbillion, affecting various sectors such as public works, education, and\nhealth. These austerity measures led to public unrest and raised concerns\nabout the potential impact on infrastructure projects and public services.\nAdditionally, the presence of entrenched criminal networks, known as _preman_\n, along with certain mass organizations (ormas), posed significant challenges\nto foreign investment and economic reforms. These groups have been involved in\nactivities such as extortion, intimidation, and obstruction of industrial\noperations, particularly in key economic zones like Bekasi, Karawang, and\nBatam. Such actions have led to financial losses estimated up to $137.8\nbillion and have deterred potential investors, undermining efforts to create a\nconducive investment climate.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2025, the IDR experienced significant fluctuations influenced\nby both domestic and global factors. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe rupiah weakened sharply, reaching around Rp 16,500 per US dollar due to\ncapital outflows and economic crash. As the economy began to recover in 2021\nand 2022, the currency stabilized, trading between Rp 14,000 and Rp 15,000 per\ndollar. However, in 2023 and 2024, the rupiah faced renewed pressure,\ndepreciating to levels around Rp 16,200 per dollar by April 2024. This\ndepreciation was attributed to political uncertainties ahead of the\npresidential election and concerns over fiscal policies.\n\nIn 2025, the rupiah's performance remained volatile. Early in the year, it\nreached a five-year low, prompting Bank Indonesia to intervene in the foreign\nexchange market to stabilize the currency. The central bank maintained its\nbenchmark interest rate at 5.75% in March to support the rupiah and control\ninflation. By May, with signs of stabilization, Bank Indonesia cut the rate to\n5.50% to stimulate economic growth, as the rupiah had appreciated over 3% from\nits April lows.",

      "• Between 2019 and 2025, the Indonesian rupiah (IDR) experienced significant fluctuations: in 2020, during COVID-19, it weakened sharply to around Rp 16,500 per USD due to capital outflows; in 2021–2022, it stabilized between Rp 14,000 and Rp 15,000; and in 2023–2024, it depreciated again to approximately Rp 16,200 per USD by April 2024, driven by political uncertainties and fiscal concerns.",
      "• In 2025, the rupiah remained volatile; early in the year, it hit a five-year low, prompting Bank Indonesia to intervene in the foreign exchange market; the central bank maintained its benchmark interest rate at 5.75% in March to support the currency and control inflation, then lowered it to 5.50% in May as the rupiah appreciated over 3% from April lows."

    "text": "Ore trucks in the mining area in West Sumbawa, West Nusa Tenggara. The\nGrasberg mine has one of the largest reserves of gold and copper in the world.\nIt is located in Mimika Regency, Papua, Indonesia near Puncak Jaya, the\nhighest mountain in the country.\n\nIndonesia was the only South East Asian member of the Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) until its suspension in 2009. The country\ncurrently remains a net oil importer despite its large petroleum production\nindustry. In 1999, crude and condensate output averaged 1.5 million barrels\n(240,000 m3) per day, and in 1998, the oil and gas sector including refining,\ncontributed approximately 9% to GDP. As of 2005, crude oil and condensate\noutput were 1.07 million barrels (170,000 m3) per day. It indicates a\nsubstantial decline from the 1990s, due primarily to ageing oil fields and a\nlack of investment in oil production equipment. This decline in production has\nbeen accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic consumption, about 5.4%\nper year, leading to an estimated US$1.2 billion cost for importing oil in\n2005. The state owns all petroleum and mineral rights. Foreign firms\nparticipate through production-sharing and work contracts. Oil and gas\ncontractors are required to finance all exploration, production, and\ndevelopment costs in their contract areas and are entitled to recover\noperating, exploration, and development costs out of the oil and gas produced.\nIndonesia had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing\nUS$7 billion in 2004. SBY has mandated a significant reduction of government\nsubsidy of fuel prices in several stages. The government has stated that cuts\nin subsidies are aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 1% of GDP in 2005,\ndown from around 1.6% last year. At the same time, the government has offered\none-time subsidies for qualified citizens, to alleviate hardships.\n\nIndonesia is the world's largest tin market. Although mineral production\ntraditionally centered on bauxite, silver, and tin, it is expanding its\ncopper, nickel, gold, and coal output for export markets. In mid-1993, the\nDepartment of Mines and Energy reopened the coal sector to foreign investment,\nresulting in a joint venture between Indonesian coal producer and BP and Rio\nTinto. Total coal production reached 74 million metric tons in 1999, including\nexports of 55 million tons, and in 2011, production was 353 million. As of\n2014, Indonesia is the third-largest producer with a total output of 458 Mt\nand export of 382 Mt. At this rate, the reserves will be used up in 61 years\nuntil 2075. Not all of the productions can be exported due to Domestic Market\nObligation (DMO) regulation, which should fulfill the domestic market. In\n2012, the DMO was 24.72%. Starting from 2014, no low-grade coal exports are\nallowed, so the upgraded brown coal process that cranks up the calorie value\nof coal from 4,500 to 6,100 kcal/kg will be built in South Kalimantan and\nSouth Sumatra. Indonesia is also the world's largest producer of nickel, and\nthe second-largest producer of cobalt in 2022.\n\nTwo US firms operate three copper/gold mines in Indonesia, with a Canadian and\nBritish firm holding significant other investments in nickel and gold,\nrespectively. India's fortune groups like Vedanta Resources and Tata Group\nalso have substantial mining operations in Indonesia. In 1998, the value of\nIndonesian gold and copper production was $1 billion and $843 million\nrespectively. Receipts from gold, copper, and coal accounted for 84% of the $3\nbillion earned in 1998 by the mineral mining sector. With the addition of\nAlumina project that produces 5% of the world's alumina production, Indonesia\nwould be the world's second-largest Alumina producer. The project will not\nmake the ores to become aluminum, as there are 100 types of Alumina\nderivatives that can be developed further by other companies in Indonesia.\n\nJoko Widodo's administration continued the resource nationalism policy of SBY,\nnationalizing some assets controlled by multinational companies such as\nFreeport McMoRan, TotalEnergies and Chevron. In 2018, in a move aimed to cut\nimports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude\noil to state-owned Pertamina.",

Today Indonesia is Japan's major supplier for natural\nrubber, liquefied natural gas, coal, minerals, paper pulp, seafood such as\nshrimp and tuna, and coffee. Traditionally Indonesia has been regarded as a\nmajor market of Japanese automotive and electronic goods.

Indeed, while in 2003 trade between Indonesia and China\nreached only US$3.8 billion, in 2010 it multiplied almost 10 times and reached\nUS$36.1 billion. China's transformation into Fastest growing country in the\n21st century has led to an increase of foreign investments in the bamboo\nnetwork, a network of overseas Chinese businesses operating in the markets of\nSoutheast Asia that share common family and cultural ties. However the free\ntrade with China has caused much anxiety in Indonesia, since inflows of cheap\nproducts from China could harm Indonesian industry. Indonesian private sector\nand civil society organizations vigorously lobbied the Indonesian government\nand members of parliament, insisting that Indonesia should either pull out of\nthe agreement or renegotiate its terms with Beijing.\n\nChina has remained on top of Indonesia's key major trading partners, serving\nas the country's largest export and import market. China serves as Indonesia's\nlargest export destination after overtaking Japan and United States, reaching\nUS$16.8 billion. China is also Indonesia's most important source of imports,\nreaching US$30.8 billion, or 22.7% of Indonesian imports in 2016. The balance\nhowever was in favour of China as Indonesia booked a trade deficit of US$14\nbillion in 2016.\n\nFrom China's perspective, since 2010 ASEAN as a whole has become its fourth-\nlargest trading partner after the European Union, Japan and the United States.\nAmong ASEAN member countries, Indonesia was China's fourth-largest trading\npartner, which, according to data as of May 2010 from the Ministry of Commerce\nof the People's Republic of China, amounted to US$12.4 billion, after Malaysia\n(US$22.2 billion), Singapore (US$17.9 billion) and Thailand (US$15.7 billion).\nWith China's economic rise, Indonesia has been intensifying its trade\nrelationship with China to counterbalance its ties with the West.

    "text": "Indonesia Stock Exchange building in Jakarta.\n\nSince the late 1980s, Indonesia has made significant changes to its regulatory\nframework to encourage economic growth. This growth was financed mostly from\nprivate investment, both foreign and domestic. US investors dominated the oil\nand gas sector and undertook some of Indonesia's largest mining projects. In\naddition, the presence of US banks, manufacturers, and service providers\nexpanded, especially after the industrial and financial sector reforms of the\n1980s. Other major foreign investors included India, Japan, the UK, Singapore,\nthe Netherlands, Qatar, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nThe 1997 crisis made continued private financing imperative but problematic.\nNew foreign investment approvals fell by almost two-thirds between 1997 and\n1999. The crisis further highlighted areas where additional reform was needed.\nFrequently cited areas for improving the investment climate were the\nestablishment of a functioning legal and judicial system, adherence to\ncompetitive processes, and adoption of internationally acceptable accounting\nand disclosure standards. Despite improvements of laws in recent years,\nIndonesia's intellectual property rights regime remains weak, and lack of\neffective enforcement is a significant concern. Under Suharto, Indonesia had\nmoved towards the private provision of public infrastructure, including\nelectric power, toll roads, and telecommunications. The 1997 crisis brought to\nlight a severe weakness in the process of dispute resolution, however,\nparticularly in the area of private infrastructure projects. Although\nIndonesia continued to have the advantages of a large labour force, abundant\nnatural resources and modern infrastructure, private investment in new\nprojects largely ceased during the crisis.\n\nAs of 28 June 2010, the Indonesia Stock Exchange had 341 listed companies with\na combined market capitalization of $269.9 billion. As of November 2010, two-\nthirds of the market capitalization was in the form of foreign funds, and only\naround 1% of the population have stock investments. Efforts are further being\nmade to improve the business and investment environment. Within the World\nBank's Doing Business Survey, Indonesia rose to 122 out of 178 countries in\n2010, from 129 in the previous year. Despite these efforts, the rank is still\nbelow regional peers, and an unfavorable investment climate persists. For\nexample, potential foreign investors and their executive staff cannot maintain\ntheir own bank accounts in Indonesia, unless they are tax-paying local\nresidents (paying tax in Indonesia for their worldwide income).[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, Indonesian companies have been involved in 3,757 mergers\nand acquisitions as either acquirer or target with a total known value of $137\nbillion. In 2010, 609 transactions were announced, which is a new record.\nNumbers had increased by 19% compared to 2009. The value of deals in 2010 was\nUS$17 billion, which is the second-highest number ever. In 2012, Indonesia\nrealized total investments of $32.5 billion, surpassing its annual target $25\nbillion, as reported by Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) on 22 January.\nThe primary investments were in the mining, transport and chemicals sectors.\nIn 2011, the Indonesian government announced a new _Masterplan_ (known as the\n_MP3EI_ , or _Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi\nIndonesia_ , the _Masterplan to Accelerate and Expand Economic Development in\nIndonesia_). The aim was to encourage increased investment, particularly in\ninfrastructure projects across Indonesia.\n\nIndonesia regained its investment grade rating from Fitch Rating in late 2011,\nand from Moody's Rating in early 2012, after losing it in the 1997 crisis,\nduring which Indonesia spent more than Rp. 450 trillion ($50 billion) to bail\nout lenders from banks.[_citation needed_] Fitch raised Indonesia's long-term\nand local currency debt rating to BBB− from BB+ with both ratings is stable.\nFitch also predicted that the economy would grow at least 6% on average per\nyear through 2013, despite a less conducive global economic climate. Moody's\nraised Indonesia's foreign and local currency bond ratings to Baa3 from Ba1\nwith a stable outlook. In May 2017, S&P Global raised Indonesia's investment\ngrade from BB+ to BBB− with a stable outlook, due to the economy experiencing\na rebound in exports and strong consumer spending during early 2017."

    "text": "In 2015, total public spending was Rp 1,806 trillion (US$130.88 billion, 15.7%\nof GDP). Government revenues, including those from state-owned enterprises\n(BUMN), totaled Rp 1,508 trillion (US$109.28 billion, 13.1% of GDP) resulting\nin a deficit of 2.6%. Since the 1997 crisis that caused an increase in debt\nand public subsidies and a decrease in development spending, Indonesia's\npublic finances have undergone a major transformation. As a result of a series\nmacroeconomic policies, including a low budget deficit, Indonesia is\nconsidered to have moved into a situation of financial resources sufficiency\nto address development needs. Decentralization, enacted during the Habibie\nadministration, has changed the manner of government spending, which has\nresulted in around 40% of public funds being transferred to regional\ngovernments by 2006.\n\nIn 2005, rising international oil prices led to the government's decision of\nslashing fuel subsidies. It led to an extra US$10 billion for government\nspending on development, and by 2006, there were an additional 5 billion due\nto steady growth, and declining debt service payments. It was the country's\nfirst \"fiscal space\" since the revenue windfall during the 1970s oil boom. Due\nto decentralization and fiscal space, Indonesia has the potential to improve\nthe quality of its public services. Such potential also enables the country to\nfocus on further reforms, such as the provision of targeted infrastructure.\nCareful management of allocated funds has been described as Indonesia's main\nissue in public expenditure.\n\nIn 2018, President Joko Widodo substantially increased the amount of debt by\ntaking foreign loans. Indonesia has increased the debt by Rp 1,815 trillion\ncompared to his predecessor, SBY. He has insisted that the loan is used for\nproductive long-term projects such as building roads, bridges, and airports.\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani also stated that despite an increase of foreign\nloans and debt, the government has also increased the budget for\ninfrastructure development, healthcare, education, and budget given to\nregencies and villages. The government is insisting that foreign debt is still\nunder control, and complying with relevant laws that limit debt to be under\n60% of GDP."

However, a large pool of the\nunemployed who will accept substandard wages and conditions remains available.\nOne factor in the increase of militancy is increased awareness via the\nInternet of prevailing wages in other countries, and the generous profits\nforeign companies are making in Indonesia.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, thousands of workers in Indonesia staged large\ndemonstrations across the country in pursuit of higher wages and improved\nlabour laws. Approximately 35,000 people rallied in total. They demanded a 22%\nto 25% increase in the minimum wage by 2016 and lower prices on essential\ngoods, including fuel.

Because of political turmoil,\nthe country once suffered hyperinflation, with 1,000% annual inflation between\n1964 and 1967, resulting in severe poverty and hunger. Even though the economy\nrecovered quickly during the first decade of the New Order administration\n(1970–1981), never once was the inflation less than 10% annually. The\ninflation slowed during the mid-1980s; however, the economy was also languid\ndue to the decrease in oil price that reduced its export revenue dramatically.\nThe economy was again experiencing rapid growth between 1989 and 1997 due to\nthe improving export-oriented manufacturing sector. Still, the inflation rate\nwas higher than economic growth, and this caused a widening gap among\nIndonesians. Inflation peaked in 1998 during the 1997 crisis at over 58%,\ncausing poverty to rise to the levels of the 1960s. During the economic\nrecovery and growth in recent years, the government has been trying to lower\nthe inflation rate. However, it seems that inflation has been affected by\nglobal fluctuation and domestic market competition. As of 2010, the inflation\nrate was approximately 7%, when its economic growth was 6%. To date, inflation\nis affecting the Indonesian lower middle class, especially those who are not\nable to afford food after price hikes. At the end of 2017, Indonesia's\ninflation rate was 3.61%, or higher than the government-set forecast of\n3.0–3.5%."
