Unsourced material may be challenged\nand removed. _( March 2025)__(Learn how and when to remove this message)_\n---|---\n\nThe 1994 genocide destroyed Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely\nimpoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded the country's\nability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made\nsignificant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy. In June\n1998, Rwanda signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the\nInternational Monetary Fund. Rwanda has also embarked upon an ambitious\nprivatization programme with the World Bank.\n\nIn the immediate postwar period—mid-1994 through 1995—emergency humanitarian\nassistance of more than $307.4 million was largely directed to relief efforts\nin Rwanda and in the refugee camps in neighbouring countries where Rwandans\nfled during the war. In 1996, humanitarian relief aid began to shift to\nreconstruction and development assistance.\n\nThe United States, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, the People's\nRepublic of China, the World Bank, the UN Development Programme and the\nEuropean Development Fund will continue to account for the substantial aid.\nRehabilitation of government infrastructure, in particular the justice system,\nwas an international priority, as well as the continued repair and expansion\nof infrastructure, health facilities, and schools.\n\nAfter the Rwandan Genocide, the Tutsi-led government began a major programme\nto improve the country's economy and reduce its dependence on subsistence\nfarming. The failing economy had been a major factor behind the genocide, as\nwas overpopulation and the resulting competition for scarce farmland and other\nresources. The government focused primarily on building up its manufacturing\nand service industries and eliminating barriers to trade and development.\n\nA coffee farmer in Rwanda.\n\nThe Government of Rwanda posted a 13% GDP growth rate in 1996 through improved\ncollection of tax revenues, accelerated privatization of state enterprises to\nstop the drain on government resources, and continued improvement in export\ncrop and food production. Tea plantations and factories continue to be\nrehabilitated, and coffee, always a smallholder's crop, is being more\nseriously rehabilitated and tended as the farmers' sense of security returns.\n\nCoffee production of 14,578,560 tonnes in 2000 compares to a pre-civil war\nvariation between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes. By 2002 tea became Rwanda's\nlargest export, with export earnings from tea reaching US$18 million equating\nto 15,000 tonnes of dried tea. Rwanda's natural resources are limited. A small\nmineral industry provides about 5% of foreign exchange earnings. Concentrates\nexist of the heavy minerals cassiterite (a primary source of tin), and coltan\n(used to manufacture electronic capacitors, used in consumer electronics\nproducts such as cell phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers).\n\nBy mid-1997, up to 75% of the factories functioning before the war had\nreturned to production, at an average of 75% of their capacity. Investments in\nthe industrial sector continue to mostly be limited to the repair of existing\nindustrial plants. Retail trade, devastated by the war, has revived quickly,\nwith many new small businesses established by Rwandan returnees from Uganda,\nBurundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIndustry received little external assistance from the end of the war through\n1995. Beginning in 1996–97, the government became increasingly active in\nhelping the industrial sector to restore production through technical and\nfinancial assistance, including loan guarantees, economic liberalization, and\nthe privatization of state-owned enterprises. In early 1998, the government\nset up a one-stop investment promotion centre and implemented a new investment\ncode that created an enabling environment for foreign and local investors. An\nautonomous revenue authority also has begun operation, improving collections\nand accountability.[_citation needed_]\n\nCassiterite production peaked at 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700\ntonnes in 2000. Recorded coltan production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999\nto 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and coltan was the country's biggest single export\nearner in 2001. At least part of the increase in production is because of new\nmines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been\nobserved, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of\nCongolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade\nof the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-\nexport is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the\nDRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as\nRwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold\nand diamonds from the DRC."

    "text": "The country entered a high period of economic growth in 2006, and the\nfollowing year managed to register 8% economic growth, a record it has\nsustained since, turning it into one of the fastest-growing economies in\nAfrica. This sustained economic growth has succeeded in reducing poverty and\nalso reducing fertility rates, with growth between 2006 and 2011 reducing the\npercentage of the country's population living in poverty from 57% to 45%.The\ncountry's infrastructure has also grown rapidly, with connections to\nelectricity going from 91,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2011. Rwanda wants to\nachieve Middle Income Country status by 2035 and High-Income Country status by\n2050.\n\nExisting foreign investment is concentrated in commercial establishments,\nmining, tea, coffee, and tourism. Minimum wage and social security regulations\nare in force, and the four prewar independent trade unions are back in\noperation. The largest union, CESTRAR, was created as an organ of the\ngovernment but became fully independent with the political reforms introduced\nby the 1991 constitution.\n\nIn 2016, Rwanda was ranked 42nd and second best country in Africa to do\nbusiness in the Mara Foundation-The Ashish J Thakkar Global Entrepreneurship\nIndex report.\n\nHowever, a recent research in the UK-based political science journal, _Review\nof African Political Economy_ , indicates that economic growth may be slower\nthan what official figures suggest. Researchers stated that average\nconsumption per household closely followed growth in GDP per capita from 2000\nto 2005, but diverged afterwards when average consumption per household\nstagnated despite huge improvements in GDP per capita from 2005 to 2013."

    "text": "Coffee beans drying in Maraba. Coffee is one of Rwanda's major cash crops.\nRwanda has the tenth highest proportion of women working in agriculture,\nforestry and fishing in the world.\n\nCrops grown in the country include coffee, tea, pyrethrum, bananas, beans,\nsorghum and potatoes. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with\nthe high altitudes, steep slopes and volcanic soils providing favourable\nconditions. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts\nin their prices. In 2019 agriculture accounted for 29% of the economy of\nRwanda. Rwanda produced in 2019: Bananas, pineapples, tea, coffee, and tobacco\nare high-value, export-oriented products.\n\n* 2.6 million tonnes of banana;\n* 1.2 million tonnes of sweet potato;\n* 1.1 million tonnes of cassava;\n* 973 thousand tonnes of potato;\n* 484 thousand tonnes of beans;\n* 421 thousand tonnes of maize;\n* 256 thousand tonnes of pumpkin;\n* 171 thousand tonnes of taro;\n* 159 thousand tonnes of sorghum;\n* 131 thousand tonnes of rice;\n* 114 thousand tonnes of sugarcane;\n* 105 thousand tonnes of tomato;\n* 36 thousand tonnes of pineapple;\n* 31 thousand tonnes of tea;\n* 29 thousand tonnes of coffee;\n* 5.4 thousand tonnes of tobacco;\n\nRwanda's economy suffered heavily during the 1994 Genocide, with widespread\nloss of life, failure to maintain the infrastructure, looting, and neglect of\nimportant cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the\ncountry's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has\nsince strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,225 in 2018,\ncompared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and\nthe United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of\nRwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in June 2010, the exchange rate\nwas 588 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African\nCommunity in 2007 and there were plans for a common East African shilling,\nwhich it had been hoped would be in place by 2015, but have not yet reached\nfruition (2020).\n\nRwanda is a country of few natural resources, and the economy is based mostly\non subsistence agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated\n90% of the working population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated\n42.0% of GDP in 2010. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have\nbeen decreasing, due in part to the resettlement of displaced people. Despite\nRwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with\npopulation growth, and food imports are required.\n\nAgricultural animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs,\nchicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each.\nProduction systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive\ndairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-\nquality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary\nservices are major constraints that restrict output. A \"One Cow per Poor\nFamily Programme\" (Girinka), implemented in 2006, distributed 341,065 cows in\n2018.\n\nFishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and\nlive fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry."

    "text": "Mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park.\n\nRwanda's service sector suffered during the late-2000s recession as banks\nreduced lending and foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The\nsector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic\noutput and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors\ninclude banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and\nrestaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate,\nbusiness services and public administration including education and health.\n\nTourism is one of the fastest-growing economic resources and became the\ncountry's leading foreign exchange earner in 2011. In spite of the genocide's\nlegacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe\ndestination; The Directorate of Immigration and Emigration recorded 405,801\npeople visiting the country between January and June 2011; 16% of these\narrived from outside Africa. Revenue from tourism was US$115,600,000 between\nJanuary and June 2011; holidaymakers contributed 43% of this revenue, despite\nbeing only 9% of the numbers.\n\nRwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited\nsafely; gorilla tracking in the Volcanoes National Park attracts thousands of\nvisitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other\nattractions include: Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus\nand other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna\nreserve in the east of the country.\n\nRwanda's tourism is centred on the attractions of Volcanoes National Park\n(PNV) with its six volcanoes and the protected population of mountain gorillas\nmade famous by Dian Fossey. Additionally, tourism is drawn to central Africa's\nlargest protected wetland Akagera National Park, with its populations of\nhippopotami, cape buffalo, zebras, elephants, elands, and other big game\nanimals. Birdwatching-related tourism has a potential to develop as well,\nespecially in Nyungwe National Park, among the largest uncut forest reserves\nin Africa. Nyungwe National Park is home to over 300 species of birds. And a\nvast variety of wild life as well.\n\nSeveral memorial sites associated with the Rwandan genocide have begun to\ngenerate significant dark tourism. For example, the Gisozi Genocide Memorial\nSite in the Gasabo District of Kigali—the burial place of approximately\n300,000 victims of the genocide—has a related genocide exhibition area and\nlibrary and has plans to develop a teaching centre on the history of the\ngenocide. Another major genocide-related memorial centre attracting tourists\nis the Murambi Genocide Memorial Site housed in the former Murambi Technical\nSchool where 45,000 people were murdered and 850 skeletons and mummified\nremains of the victims are on display.\n\nTwo other major memorial sites associated with the genocide are in Kicukiro\nDistrict: Rebero Genocide Memorial Site where 14,400 victims are buried and\nthe Nyanza-Kicukiro Genocide Memorial Site where 5,000 victims were killed\nafter Belgian soldiers who serving in the United Nations peacekeeping forces\nabandoned them. In Kibungo Province, the site of the Nyarubuye Massacre is\nhome to the Nyarubuye Genocide Memorial Site where an estimated 20,000 victims\nwere killed after seeking refuge in the Roman Catholic church and homes of the\nnuns and priest there."
