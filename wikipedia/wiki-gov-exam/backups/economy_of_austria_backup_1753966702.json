Until the 1980s, many of Austria's\nlargest industry firms were nationalised. In recent years, privatisation has\nreduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.\nAmong OECD nations, Austria has a highly efficient and strong social security\nsystem; social expenditure stood at roughly 29.4% of GDP.\n\nLabor movements are particularly strong in Austria, and they have a large\ninfluence on labor politics. Next to a highly developed industry,\ninternational tourism is the most important part of the national economy. The\neconomy of Austria's average GDP is 13th growth in OECD countries, from 1992\nto 2017. In Austria, 1.37% over average population growth is the strong\nfactor.\n\nGermany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making the\nAustrian economy vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However,\nsince Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained\ncloser ties to other European Union economies. This development reduced its\neconomic dependence on Germany. In addition, Austria's membership in the EU\nhas drawn an influx of foreign investors.\n\nThey were attracted by Austria's access to the European Single Market and the\ncountry's proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in\nGDP has accelerated in recent years, and reached 3.3% in 2006.\n\nIn 2024 Austria has a very high, $58,669 nominal GDP per capita ranked 13th.\n\nVienna was ranked the fifth richest NUTS-2 region within Europe (see Economy\nof the European Union), with its GDP reaching €38,632 per capita. It was\ntrailing behind Inner London, Luxembourg, the Brussels-Capital Region and\nHamburg.\n\nGrowth had been steady between 2002 and 2006, varying between 1 and 3.3%.\nAfter hitting 0% in 2013, growth had picked up a little. As of 2016, growth\nwas set at 1.5%."

As such, the Austrian economic crisis\nstretched into its second year, with inflation running at 99%."

    "text": "Source:\n\nWith annual inflation running at 2,877%, the League of Nations was officially\nappointed to organise an Austrian reconstruction plan in August 1922. The\nLeague scheme was based on the view that Austrian troubles as a result of an\ninability to pay for necessities and obtain credit, and therefore, an Austrian\nfinancial revival was critical to Austrian survival. To this end, the plan was\nfocused solely on financial reconstruction. Austria would receive loans raised\nfrom international money markets and the Austrian public, which would be\nsecured on customs and tobacco taxes. In exchange, Austria would in effect\nlose sovereignty over its economy, agreeing to:\n\n* Relinquish control over the mints to an independent bank, with the aim of returning to the gold standard.\n* Terminate the printing of money by the central bank.\n* Eliminate the budget deficit (requiring the implementation of austerity measures and monetary control).\n\nThe measures took effect in 1923. Short-term effects were impressive; during\nthe announcement to undertake Austrian reconstruction in August 1922, public\nconfidence soared. Foreign currency holdings were converted back into krone,\nstabilising the currency. This allowed the Austrian Foreign Exchange Agency to\nfinally intervene to fix the krone to the dollar, something that the wild\ngyrations of the past had not permitted. Capital rushed back into Austria, and\ndomestic prices stabilised, pronouncing the end of hyperinflation.\n\nThe steam ran out shortly after implementation. Growth averaged 0.35% per\nannum until 1929, unemployment leapt five-fold, bankruptcies increased\n41-fold, and the trade deficit doubled."

    "text": "Ever since the end of the World War II, Austria has achieved sustained\neconomic growth. In the soaring 1950s, the rebuilding efforts for Austria lead\nto an average annual growth rate of more than 5% in real terms and averaged\nabout four-point five percent through most of the 1960s. Following moderate\nreal GDP growth of 1.7%, 2% and 1.2%, respectively, in 1995, 1996, and 1997,\nthe economy rebounded and with real GDP expansion of 2.9 percent in 1998 and\n2.2% in 1999.\n\nAustria became a member of the EU on 1 January 1995. Membership brought\neconomic benefits and challenges and has drawn an influx of foreign investors\nattracted by Austria's access to the single European market. Austria also has\nmade progress in generally increasing its international competitiveness. As a\nmember of the economic and monetary union of the European Union (EMU),\nAustria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member countries,\nespecially with Germany. On 1 January 1999, Austria introduced the new Euro\ncurrency for accounting purposes. In January 2002, Euro notes and coins were\nintroduced, replacing those of the Austrian schilling."

Eight different designs, one per face value,\nwere selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new\ncommon map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common\nside of its coins.\n\nBefore adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the Austrian\nschilling which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was\nabolished in the wake of the Anschluss in 1938 and has been reintroduced after\nthe end of the World War II in November 1945.\n\nAustria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the\nEurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro\ncoin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old\nnational practice of minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues,\nthese coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5\nAustrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country."

For many\nyears, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a\nvery important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early\n1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate\nlargely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly\nor partially privatised. The government still operates some firms, state\nmonopolies, utilities, and services. Due to the 2008 financial crisis, two\nbanks were nationalised. Since 2019 the Österreichische Industrieholding\n(ÖBAG) administers the investments of the Republic of Austria in partially or\nentirely nationalized companies, but came under strong criticism after leaked\nmessages showed how Thomas Schmidt had a say in the appointment of the\nsupervisory board and became sole director. Austria enjoys well-developed\nindustry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.\n\nAustria has a strong labour movement. The Austrian Trade Union Federation\n(ÖGB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5\nmillion—more than half the country's wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the\nÖGB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with\nindustry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and\neconomic issues in what is known as Austria's \"social partnership\". The ÖGB\nhas often opposed the Schüssel government's programme for budget\nconsolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and\nindications are rising that Austria's peaceful social climate could become\nmore confrontational."

Since Austria's\nbecoming a member of the EU in 1995, the Austrian agricultural sector has been\nundergoing substantial reform under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).\nAlthough Austrian farmers provide about 80% of domestic food requirements, the\nagricultural contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has declined since\n1950 to less than 3%.\n\nAlthough some industries are global competitors, such as several iron and\nsteel works, chemical plants and oil corporations that are large industrial\nenterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial\nenterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.\n\nKitzbühel, one of Austria's famous winter tourist cities\n\nMost important for Austria is the service sector generating the vast majority\nof Austria's GDP. Vienna has grown into a finance and consulting metropole and\nhas established itself as the door to the East within the last decades.\nViennese law firms and banks are among the leading corporations in business\nwith the new EU member states. Tourism is very important for Austria's\neconomy, accounting for around 10 percent of Austria's GDP. In 2001, Austria\nwas the tenth most visited country in the world with over 18.2 million\ntourists. Previously, dependency on German guests made this sector of the\nAustrian economy very dependent on German economy. However recent developments\nhave brought a change, especially since winter ski resorts such as Arlberg or\nKitzbühel are now more and more frequented by Eastern Europeans, Russians and\nAmericans.\n\nAustria produced in 2018:\n\n* 2.3 million tons of sugar beet (the beet is used to manufacture sugar and ethanol);\n* 2.1 million tons of maize;\n* 1.3 million tons of wheat;\n* 697 thousand tons of potato;\n* 695 thousand tons of barley;\n* 387 thousand tons of apple;\n* 367 thousand tons of grape;\n* 278 thousand tons of triticale;\n* 184 thousand tons of soybean;\n* 177 thousand tons of rye (12th largest world producer);\n* 132 thousand tons of onion;\n* 120 thousand tons of rapeseed;\n* 111 thousand tons of pear;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products."

To date, Austrian parent\ncompanies have acquired 854 German companies in outbound M&A deals,\nhighlighting the strong bilateral ties between the two nations.\n\nWhen analyzing the industries that have witnessed the most M&A activity in\nAustria, the financial sector emerges as a prominent player in terms of\ntransaction value. The financial industry has been the focus of significant\nM&A deals, with companies in this sector exploring opportunities to strengthen\ntheir market positions, expand their product portfolios, and enhance their\ncapabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, when considering the number of transactions, the\nIndustrials sector takes the lead, representing approximately 19.2% of the\ntotal M&A deals in Austria. This sector encompasses a wide range of\nindustries, including manufacturing, engineering, construction, and\ntransportation, among others. The strong presence of M&A activity in the\nIndustrials sector signifies the ongoing interest in consolidating businesses,\ndriving synergies, and fostering growth through strategic partnerships and\nacquisitions.\n\nThe M&A landscape in Austria continues to evolve, influenced by various\nfactors such as market dynamics, economic conditions, and global trends. As\ncompanies seek opportunities for expansion, diversification, and innovation,\nM&A transactions will remain a strategic tool for achieving their business\nobjectives. The financial sector and the Industrials sector are likely to\nremain at the forefront of M&A activity, demonstrating the vibrancy and\npotential for further growth in these industries."
