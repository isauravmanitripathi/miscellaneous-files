Also,\ntight controls on exchange rates and the scarcity of foreign exchange have\nimpaired short-term economic prospects. The black market value of the\nSeychellois rupee is anywhere from two thirds to one half the official\nexchange rate.[_citation needed_] The next few years were also slow due to the\nworldwide economic downturn and the fear of flying brought on by the terrorism\non 11 September 2001.\n\nMore recently though, tourism has roared back at a record pace setting\nsuccessive records in 2006 and again in 2007 for number of visitors.[_citation\nneeded_] The increased availability of flights to and from the archipelago due\nin part to new entrants Emirates and Qatar airlines is also beginning to show.\nBoth at official exchange rates and at purchasing power parity (PPP),\nSeychelles remains the richest territory in Africa in terms of GDP per capita\n(US$9,440.095 at real exchange rates and US$17,560.062 at PPP 2008 estimate),\n\nBecause of economic contraction (the economy declined by about 2% in 2004 and\n2005 and lost another 1.4% in 2006 according to the International Monetary\nFund) the country was moving downwards in terms of per capita income. However,\nthe economy bounced back in 2007, growing by 5.3% due in part to record\ntourism numbers and the booming building and offshore industries. The IMF\nforecast further growth in 2008 with continuing increase in the GDP per\ncapita.\n\nIn October 2008, as tourism and fishing revenue began slowing, the Seychelles\ndefaulted on a $230 million debt. The International Monetary Fund stepped with\na two-year, $26 million rescue package. The rescue package came with a few\nstipulations; The country laid off 1,800 government workers, floated its\ncurrency, lifted foreign exchange controls and sold off state assets. At the\ntime, the country's $800 million external foreign debt was equivalent to\nalmost 175 percent of its gross domestic product.\n\nThe decision to let the currency trade freely as part of the IMF rescue\npackage means that Seychelles is the smallest country in the world that has a\ncompletely independent currency - one that is neither pegged, nor an adopted\nforeign currency, nor a common currency used within a larger monetary union.\nWhen the Seychellois rupee became freely floated on 3 November 2008, its value\nquickly fell drastically, decreasing from eight per U.S. dollar to 16,\neffectively doubled the prices of imports.\n\nThe global recession and piracy in the Indian Ocean hit Seychelles hard in\n2009, with the GDP projected to contract by 7.5 percent. However the\ngovernment exceeded its fiscal targets, with a primary surplus of 13.4% of GDP\nin the first nine months of 2009 according to the IMF. They report expenditure\nhas been tightly controlled and revenue has held up well despite the difficult\neconomic environment.\n\nIn May 2010 an International Monetary Fund mission visited Seychelles and\nconcluded the country is making progress. The head of the mission, Mr. Jean Le\nDem, said at the conclusion of the visit:\n\n> The economy is recovering from a recession that put real gross domestic\n> product (GDP) to almost a stand in 2009. Real GDP is projected to grow at 4\n> percent in 2010, reflecting primarily a rebound in tourism earnings. Twelve-\n> month inflation, which was negative during the past few months, is expected\n> to return to about 1 percent by year-end\n\nIn 2017 the Seychelles joined the World Trade Organisation, facilitated by\nOmani economist Hilda al-Hinai, who chaired the Working Group."

A separate Monetary Authority supervises the banking system and\nmanages the money supply. Although foreign banks operate branches in\nSeychelles, the government owns the two local banks—the Development Bank of\nSeychelles, which mobilizes resources to fund development programs, and the\nSeychelles Saving Bank, a bank for savings and current accounts.\n\nThe Financial Services Authority (formerly Seychelles International Business\nAuthority - SIBA) is charged with overseeing the quickly growing non-banking\nfinancial services industry."

Clastic reservoirs with measured porosities up to 22% in the Early-Middle Jurassic;\n6. Sealing lithologies occur both locally in syn-rift, and regionally in post-rift sequences;\n7.

A variety of trapping styles, dominated by tilted fault blocks, stratigraphic pinchouts and reefs;\n9. Multiple heating events, with the principal event post-dating trap formation; and\n10. Hydrocarbon generation and migration with the presence of: a) numerous DHIs on seismic, including gas chimneys, flat spots, bright spots, phase changes and chemosynthetic reefs; b) gas sniffer anomalies, involving ethane/iso-butane in the southeast and propane/normal butane/total hydrocarbon in the north and northeast; c) UV fluorescence anomalies, especially over the wells and in the southeast; and d) 4 types of beach-stranded tar that correlate to the local source rock stratigraphy.\n\nHowever, to date all exploratory and stratigraphic test wells (a total of 9\nsince the 1970s) in the Seychelles have failed to find commercial\nhydrocarbons. The most recent wildcat by Enterprise Oil in 1995 detected gas\nbut failed to find hydrocarbons.\n\nSeveral oil and gas exploration companies are active in the Seychelles\noffshore. These include East African Exploration (EAX) (a subsidiary of\nAfren), Avana Petroleum (a subsidiary of Vanoil Energy) and WHL Energy.\n\nBeginning at the turn of the millennium the Seychelles Petroleum Company\n(SEPEC) started to develop the first fleet of modern petroleum double-hull\ntankers, with five vessels, which was completed by late 2007/early 2008 with\nthe possibility to build more in the near future. The Seychelles President\nclaims that this has opened the door to a new industry for his country and\nencouraged economic growth by further removing over-reliance on traditional\ntrades like fisheries and tourism, which is now falling rapidly as the\ncountry's main income but nevertheless, has experienced significant growth in\nrecent years.\n\nThe country has also increased its capacity for wind power, with windfarms on\nRomainville Island."
