    "text": "Norway was the poorest of the three Scandinavian kingdoms (the others being\nDenmark and Sweden) during the Viking Age.\n\nPrior to the industrial revolution, Norway's economy was largely based on\nagriculture, timber, and fishing. Norwegians typically lived under conditions\nof considerable scarcity, though famine was rare. Except for certain fertile\nareas in Hedemarken and Østfold, crops were limited to hardy grains, such as\noats, rye, and barley; and livestock to sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, and some\npoultry; in places this was complemented with hunting. In areas of Central and\nNorthern Norway, the Sami subsisted on the nomadic herding of reindeer.\nFishing all around the coast was dangerous work, though fish such as herring,\ncod, halibut, and other cold-water species were found in abundance. The\nintroduction of the potato to Norway, promoted by practical priests and the\nking in Copenhagen in the 18th century, provided considerable relief and\nbecame common food for Norwegians.\n\nAll around the coast, the harvesting of fish (including cod, herring, halibut,\nand other cold water species) was an important supplement to farming and was\nin many areas in the north and west the primary household subsistence. Fishing\nwas typically supplemented with crop-growing and the raising of livestock on\nsmall farms.\n\nThe economic conditions in Norway did not lend themselves to the formation of\nfeudal system, though several kings did reward land to loyal subjects who\nbecame knights. Self-owning farmers were—and continue to be—the main unit of\nwork in Norwegian agriculture, but leading up to the 19th century farmers ran\nout of land available for farming. Many agricultural families were reduced to\npoverty as tenant farmers, and served as the impetus for emigration to North\nAmerica. Norway, after Ireland, became the country losing the most people to\nthis emigration in percentage relative to its population.",

Exploration started on 19 July 1966, when Ocean\nTraveler drilled its first well. Oil was first encountered at the Balder oil\nfield at flank of the Utsira High, about 190 km west of Stavanger, in 1967.\nInitial exploration was fruitless, until Ocean Viking found oil on 21 August\n1969. By the end of 1969, it was clear that there were large oil and gas\nreserves in the North Sea. The first oil field was Ekofisk, produced 427,442\nbarrels (67,957.8 m3) of crude in 1980. Since then, large natural gas reserves\nhave also been discovered.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Norwegian referendum to not join the European\nUnion, the Norwegian Ministry of Industry, headed by Ola Skjåk Bræk moved\nquickly to establish a national energy policy. Norway decided to stay out of\nOPEC, keep its own energy prices in line with world markets, and spend the\nrevenue – known as the \"currency gift\" – wisely. The Norwegian government\nestablished its own oil company, Statoil (now known as Equinor), and awarded\ndrilling and production rights to Norsk Hydro and the newly formed Saga\nPetroleum. Petroleum exports are taxed at a marginal rate of 78% (standard\ncorporate tax of 24%, and a special petroleum tax of 54%).\n\nThe North Sea turned out to present many technological challenges for\nproduction and exploration, and Norwegian companies invested in building\ncapabilities to meet these challenges. A number of engineering and\nconstruction companies emerged from the remnants of the largely lost\nshipbuilding industry, creating centers of competence in Stavanger and the\nwestern suburbs of Oslo. Stavanger also became the land-based staging area for\nthe offshore drilling industry. Presently North Sea is past its peak oil\nproduction.

This has had a significant effect on Norway's agricultural policy, which has been reshaped to address population patterns rather than self-sufficiency.\n* The proceeds from oil revenue could not fuel private or public consumption if Norway were to sustain its prosperity when oil reserves run out.\n* In order to participate in European markets, Norway has had to open its domestic markets to European imports. Although some pricing and distribution issues (e.g., alcohol and automobiles) remain unresolved, Norway's consumer, capital, and employment markets are increasingly approaching those of Europe in general.[_citation needed_][_clarification needed Prices are very high in Norway!_]\n\nNorwegians have sought accommodations on a range of specific issues, such as\nproducts from fish farms, agricultural products, emission standards, etc., but\nthese do not appear to differ substantially from those sought by bona fide EU\nmembers.

    "text": "GDP growth 1865–2004\n\nSeveral issues have dominated the debate on Norway's economy since the 1970s:\n\n* **Cost of living**. Norway is among the most expensive countries in the world, as reflected in the Big Mac Index and other indices. Historically, transportation costs and barriers to free trade had caused the disparity, but in recent years, Norwegian policy in labor relations, taxation, and other areas have contributed significantly.\n* **Competitiveness of \"mainland\" industries**. The high cost of labor and other structural features of the Norwegian environment have caused concern about Norway's ability to maintain its standard of living in a post-petroleum era. There is a clear trend toward ending the practice of \"protecting\" certain industries (_vernede industrier_) and making more of them \"exposed to competition\" (_konkurranseutsettelse_). In addition to interest in information technology, a number of small- to medium-sized companies have been formed to develop and market highly specialized technology solutions.\n* **The role of the public sector**. The ideological divide between socialist and non-socialist views on public ownership has decreased over time. The Norwegian government has sought to reduce its ownership over companies that require access to private capital markets, and there is an increasing emphasis on government facilitating entrepreneurship rather than controlling (or restricting) capital formation. A residual distrust of the \"profit motive\" persists, and Norwegian companies are heavily regulated, especially with respect to labor relations.\n* **The future of the welfare state**. Since World War II, successive Norwegian governments have sought to broaden and extend public benefits to its citizens, in the form of sickness and disability benefits, minimum guaranteed pensions, heavily subsidized or free universal health care, unemployment insurance, and so on. Public policy still favors the provision of such benefits, but there is increasing debate on making them more equitable and needs-based.\n* **Urbanization**. For several decades, agricultural policy in Norway was based on the premise of minimal self-sufficiency. In later years, this has given way to a greater emphasis on maintaining population patterns outside of major urban areas. The term \"district policy\" (_distriktspolitikk_) has come to mean the demand that old and largely rural Norway is allowed to persist, ideally by providing them with a sustainable economic basis.\n* **Taxation**.  The primary purpose of the Norwegian tax system has been to raise revenue for public expenditures; but it is also viewed as a means to achieve social objectives, such as redistribution of income, reduction in alcohol and tobacco consumption, and as a disincentive against certain behaviors. Three elements of the tax system seem to attract the most debate:\n* Progressive taxation. At one time one of the most aggressive in the world, the top marginal tax rate on income has been decreased over time. In addition, Norwegians are taxed for their stated net worth, which some have argued discourages savings.\n* Value-added tax. The largest source of government revenue. The current standard rate is 25%, food and drink is 15%, and movie theater tickets and public transportation 12%.\n* Special surcharges and taxes. The government has established a number of taxes related to specific purchases, including cars, alcohol, tobacco, and various kinds of benefits.\n* Svalbard. People living on Svalbard (Spitsbergen) pay reduced taxes due to the Svalbard Treaty.\n* **Environmental concerns**. A number of political issues have had their origins in ecological concerns, including the refineries at Mongstad and the hydroelectric power plant at Alta.\n\nNorwegian exports in 2006",

The government controls around\n35% of the total value of publicly listed companies on the Oslo stock\nexchange, with five of its largest seven listed firms partially owned by the\nstate. When non-listed companies are included the state has an even higher\nshare in ownership (mainly from direct oil license ownership). Norway's state-\nowned enterprises comprise 9.6% of all non-agricultural employment, a number\nthat rises to almost 13% when companies with minority state ownership stakes\nare included, the highest among OECD countries. Both listed and non-listed\nfirms with state ownership stakes are market-driven and operate in a highly\nliberalized market economy.\n\nThe oil and gas industries play a dominant role in the Norwegian economy,\nproviding a source of finance for the Norwegian welfare state through direct\nownership of oil fields, dividends from its shares in Equinor, and licensure\nfees and taxes. The oil and gas industry is Norway's largest in terms of\ngovernment revenue and value-added. The organization of this sector is\ndesigned to ensure the exploration, development and extraction of petroleum\nresources result in public value creation for the entire society through a\nmixture of taxation, licensing and direct state ownership through a system\ncalled the State's Direct Financial Interest (SDFI). The SDFI was established\nin 1985 and represents state-owned holdings in a number of oil and gas fields,\npipelines and onshore facilities as well as 67% of the shares in Equinor.\nGovernment revenues from the petroleum industry are transferred to the\nGovernment Pension Fund of Norway Global in a structure that forbids the\ngovernment from accessing the fund for public spending; only income generated\nby the funds' capital can be used for government spending.\n\nThe high levels of state ownership have been motivated for a variety of\nreasons, but most importantly by a desire for national control of the\nutilization of natural resources. Direct state involvement began prior to the\n20th century with the provision of public infrastructure, and expanded greatly\ninto industry and commercial enterprises after the Second World War through\nthe acquisition of German assets in several manufacturing companies. The\nlargest expansion of state ownership occurred with the establishment of\nStatoil in 1972. Industries and commercial enterprises where the state owns\nstakes are and market-driven, with marketization extending to public service\nproviders as well as industry.",
