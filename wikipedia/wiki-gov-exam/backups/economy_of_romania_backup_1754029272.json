    "text": "The end of the communist period marked the beginning of a sharp economic\ndownturn. Romania's weight in the global economy dropped to 0.3% in 1993, down\nfrom 0.8% in 1983.\n\nPrivatisation of industry started with the 1992 transfer of 30% of the shares\nof some 6,000 state-owned enterprises to five private ownership funds, in\nwhich each adult citizen received certificates of ownership. The remaining 70%\nownership of the enterprises was transferred to a state ownership fund, with a\nmandate to sell off its shares at the rate of at least 10% per year. The\nprivatisation law also called for direct sale of some 30 specially selected\nenterprises and the sale of \"assets\" (i.e., commercially viable component\nunits) of larger enterprises.\n\nAs of 2008, inflation stood at 7.8%, up from 4.8% in 2007 estimated by the BNR\nat coming within 6% for the year 2006 (the year-on-year CPI, published in\nMarch 2007, is 3.66%). Also, since 2001, the economy has grown steadily at\naround 6–8%. Therefore, the PPP per capita GDP of Romania in 2008 was\nestimated to be between $12,200 and $14,064.\n\nRomania was the largest U.S. trading partner in Central-Eastern Europe until\nNicolae Ceaușescu's 1988 renunciation of Most Favored Nation (non-\ndiscriminatory) trading status, which resulted in higher U.S. tariffs on\nRomanian products. Congress approved restoration of the MFN status effective 8\nNovember 1993, as part of a new bilateral trade agreement. Tariffs on most\nRomanian products dropped to zero in February 1994 with the inclusion of\nRomania in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Major Romanian exports\nto the U.S. include shoes and clothing, steel, and chemicals.\n\nRomania signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 1992 and a free trade\nagreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1993, codifying\nRomania's access to European markets and creating the basic framework for\nfurther economic integration. Romania formally joined the EU in 2007.\n\nDuring the later part of the Ceaușescu period, Romania had earned significant\ncontracts from several developing countries, notably Iraq, for oil-related\nprojects. In August 2005 Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1.7 billion\ndebt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the\nU.S.-led \"Coalition of the Willing\", making Romania the first country outside\nof the Paris Club of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts.\n\nGrowth in 2000–07 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Italy and\nGermany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic\ndemand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as\ninterest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages\nincreases. Current account deficits of around 2% of GDP are beginning to\ndecline[_citation needed_] as demand for Romanian products in the European\nUnion increases. Accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to\nstructural reform.\n\nIn early 2004 the government passed increases in the value-added tax (VAT) and\ntightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the\npublic finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and\nhealthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections.\nPrivatisation of the state-owned bank Banca Comercială Română took place in\n2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the\nfinancial sector, and effective use of available EU funds is expected to\naccelerate economic growth. However, the Romanian economy was affected by the\n2008 financial crisis and contracted in 2009.\n\nAfter communism, Romania needed capital infusion, entrepreneurial and\nmanagerial skills, the fastest way to obtain that was through foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI). As of 2018, total FDI in Romania was 81 billion EUR, 63% of\ntotal (51 billion) are greenfield investments. Top ten FDI stock by country of\norigin in 2018 were: Netherlands (23.9%), Germany (12.7%), Austria (12.2%),\nItaly (9.5%), Cyprus (6.2%), France (6%), Switzerland (4.5%), Luxembourg\n(4.2%), Belgium (2.2%) and United Kingdom (2.1%)."

The\nCernavodă Nuclear Power Plant is the only one of its kind in Romania, although\nthere are plans to build a second one in Transylvania, possibly after 2020.\n\nFor domestic heating and cooking 48% of rural and small-town households use\ndirectly burned solid fuel (almost exclusively domestically produced wood) as\nthe main energy source.\n\nWind power had an installed capacity of 76 MW in 2008, and 3028 MW in 2016.\nThe country has the largest wind power potential in Southeast Europe, with\nDobruja listed as the second-best place in Europe to construct wind farms. As\na result, there are currently[_when?_] investor connection requests for over\n12,000 MW. There are also plans to build a number of solar power stations,\nsuch as the Covaci Solar Park, which will be one of the largest in the world."

A further strong increase of traffic is expected in the future.\n\nAs of December 2023, 1,065.9 km (662.3 mi) of motorways are in use with a\nsmall portion of Lugoj-Deva (between Margina and Holdea) to be finished while\nSibiu-Pitești is still tendering. The railway network, which was significantly\nexpanded during the Communist years, is the fourth largest in Europe.\n\nBucharest is the only city in Romania which has an underground railway system,\ncomprising both the Bucharest Metro and the light rail system managed by Regia\nAutonomă de Transport București. Although construction was planned to begin in\n1941, due to geo-political factors, the Bucharest Metro was only opened in\n1979. Now it is one of the most accessed systems of the Bucharest public\ntransport network with an average ridership of 800,000 passengers during the\nworkweek. In total, the network is 71 km long and has 53 stations."

Along with the decline of sea-fishing,\ncommercial fish farms – especially in salmon, have increased in prominence in\nthe rivers and lochs of the east of Romania.
