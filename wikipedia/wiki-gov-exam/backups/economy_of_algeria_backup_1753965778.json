Currently, Algeria has a mixed economy. Since independence\nin 1962, Algeria has launched major economic projects to build up a dense\nindustrial base. However, despite these major achievements (roads, freeways,\nuniversities, hospitals, factories, housing, metro and tramway systems, etc.),\nthe Algerian economy has gone through various stages of turbulence.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Algerian economy experienced major difficulties. The oil\ncounter-shock of 1986 dealt a heavy blow to a virtually rentier economy,\nduring the period of anti-scarcity and stabilization plans. In the early\n1990s, Algeria embarked on a series of structural reforms, making the\ntransition to a market economy a reality.\n\nIn 2012, the Algerian economy remains highly dependent on hydrocarbon rents,\nwhich represent the country's main source of revenue, without having succeeded\nin diversifying and establishing internationally competitive\nindustrialization.\n\nThe 2017 report on Algeria by business intelligence and consultancy firm\nOxford Business Group (OGB), highlights the efforts devoted by the country to\nstrengthening and diversifying its economy against the backdrop of falling oil\nprices. The report highlights the growing contribution of the private sector\nto GDP, in particular the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\nsupported by new measures; as well as the financial services sector, which has\nseen positive developments such as the introduction of online payments.\n\nDespite the efforts made, the country still faces a number of short-term\nproblems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political,\neconomic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce social\ninequality between regions, in order to achieve better economic growth.\nAlgeria has the triple leverage of energy, mining and agriculture to\ncontribute, in the long term, to containing the supply crises in energy, rare\nearths (minerals useful for technology) and food.\n\nPublished in 2023, the World Bank's report on the Algerian economy calls for\nthe acceleration of institutional and micro-economic reforms, and paints a\npositive picture for the country's economy. The World Bank notes that the\npromulgation in 2022 of the new investment law and the publication of its\nimplementing regulations, the abolition in 2020 of the 51/49 rule for non-\nstrategic sectors, and the publication of the new hydrocarbons law in 2019 are\npositive steps, but must tackle the ecosystem, including paralyzing\nbureaucracy, with greater visibility in socio-economic policy.\n\nContinued implementation of government structural reform programs, creating\ngreater openness to the private sector, improving the economy’s\ncompetitiveness, and strengthening investment in human capital are all\nessential to the flourishing and resilience of the Algerian economy.",

    "text": "The total imports and exports on the eve of the French invasion (in 1830) did\nnot exceed £175,000. By 1850, the figures had reached £5,000,000; in 1868,\n£12,000,000; in 1880, £17,000,000; and in 1890, £20,000,000. From this point\nprogress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year. In 1905\nthe total value of the foreign trade was £24,500,000. About five-sixths of the\ntrade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have\nbeen admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867. French goods, except\nsugar, have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.\nAfter the 1892 increase of the French minimum tariff which applied to Algeria\nfor the first time, foreign trade greatly diminished.[_citation needed_]\n\nGDP per capita grew 40% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 538% in the\n1970s. Growth collapsed to 9.7% in the turbulent 1980s. Failure of timely\nreforms by successive governments caused the current GDP per capita to shrink\nby 28% in the 1990s.\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Algeria at market prices\nestimated by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nYear | Gross Domestic Product\nmillion Algerian dinars | US Dollar Exchange\nAlgerian dinars | Inflation Index\n(2000=100) | Per Capita Income\n(as % of USA)\n---|---|---|---|---\n1980 | 162,500 | 3.83 | 9.30 | 18.51\n1985 | 291,600 | 4.77 | 14 | 15.55\n1990 | 554,400 | 12.19 | 22 | 10.65\n1995 | 2,004,990 | 47.66 | 73 | 5.39\n2000 | 4,123,514 | 75.31 | 100 | 5.17\n2005 | 7,493,000 | 73.44 | 114 | 7.43\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 70.01\nAlgerian dinars only (updated May 24, 2007). Average wages in 2007 hover\naround US$18–22 per day.\n\nEast-West Highway near Relizane\n\nBurdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby\narrangement with the International Monetary Fund in April 1994 and the\nfollowing year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended 30\nApril 1998. In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's\nSoviet-era debt during a visit by President Vladimir Putin to the country, the\nfirst by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president Abdelaziz\nBouteflika agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defence\nsystems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state\narms exporter Rosoboronexport.\n\nSome progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings in 1995 and\n1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth\nsince 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget\ndeficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The\ncountry's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its\ncurrent level of $5 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999–2000 and the\ngovernment's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade\nsurplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the\ncountry's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the\nfloods of 10 November 2001 and an uncertain oil market made prospects for\n2002-03 more problematic. The government has pledged to continue its efforts\nto diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside\nthe energy sector.\n\nHotel Zianides in Tlemcen.\n\nPresident Bouteflika has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if\nimplemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy\nremains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has\ncontinued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic\ninvestment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing\nhigh unemployment and improving living standards. Other priority areas include\nbanking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government\nbureaucracy.\n\nThe government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a\nnational cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other\nindustries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement\nwith the European Union. In June 1987, Algeria started accession negotiations\nfor entry into the World Trade Organization, but negotiations ceased in 2014.\n\nIn the 2000s the country enjoyed several years of strong economic performance,\nwith solid non-hydrocarbon growth, low inflation, an overall budget surplus\nand a positive trade balance.",

    "text": "Algeria's banking sector is dominated by public banks, which suffer from high\nlevels of non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of 2007,\npublic banks controlled 95 percent of total bank assets. In 2007 nonperforming\nloans represented a towering 38 percent of total loans at public banks,\naccording to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Modest progress has\nbeen made in implementing several reforms proposed by the IMF, including\nreplacing bank credits to SOEs with government subsidies; boosting bank\nsupervision, accountability, and transparency; and modernizing the payments\nsystem. One specific reform that has been achieved is the establishment in\n2006 of the Algerian Real Time Settlements system, which facilitates the\nprompt and reliable electronic transfer of payments. In November 2007, the\nproposed sale and privatization of Crédit Populaire d’Algérie was postponed\nbecause of turbulent market conditions. Recently, HSBC and Deutsche Bank\nannounced that they would commence commercial banking (in the case of HSBC)\nand investment banking (in the case of Deutsche Bank) in Algeria. Only a few\ncompanies are listed on the underdeveloped and relatively opaque Algiers stock\nexchange. The non-bank sector remains less developed, although recent reforms\nin the field of regulation and supervision have laid the foundations for\nleasing, factoring, and venture capital.\n\nThe Algerian equity market remains relatively shallow, with only four\ncompanies being listed in the Bourse d’Algerie. Conversely, the bond market\nhas expanded in recent years: the government has issued debt instruments with\nvarying maturities of up to fifteen years, and five private companies have\nissued corporate bonds.\n\nThe insurance sector was liberalized in 1995, but is still dominated by\ngovernment-owned institutions and so far accounts only for a very small part\nof the economy: total premium volume amounted to approximately 1 percent of\nGDP. The pension sector encompasses three pension funds, which attained\ncoverage of approximately 40 percent of the working population in 2005.\n\nBased on 2006 and 2007 estimates, 31 percent of the total population has\naccess to financial services, with one bank branch or post office every 7,250\ninhabitants. The microfinance sector still has great potential for further\ndevelopment. A 2006 study could not find major regulatory impediments to\nmicrofinance and suggested that the geographical net of postal offices –\noffering an increasing number of financial services to customers – holds a\nhigh potential of increasing access to finance for the Algerian population.\n\nOfficial remittance inflows increased steadily from US$1.9 to 2.9 billion\nbetween 2005 and 2007.",

One of the reasons for this\ndisparity is that the energy sector is very capital-intensive. Trade accounts\nfor 14.6 percent of the workforce, while the construction and public works\nsector employs 10 percent, reflecting the government's efforts to upgrade the\ncountry's infrastructure and stock of affordable housing.\n\nUnemployment has remained at levels around 10% since 2010 but is significantly\nhigher for youth (24.8%) and women (16.3%)\n\nAt the end of 2006, the unemployment rate was about 15.7 percent, but the rate\namong those under the age of 25 was 70 percent.

    "text": "Algeria is seeking more trade and foreign investment. For example, the\nhydrocarbons law passed in April 2005 is designed to encourage foreign\ninvestment in energy exploration. Increased production could raise Algeria's\nprofile as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nIn keeping with its pro-trade agenda, Algeria achieved association status with\nthe European Union (EU) in September 2005. Over a 12-year period, the\nassociation agreement is expected to enable Algeria to export goods to the EU\ntariff-free, while it gradually lifts tariffs on imports from the EU. Algeria\nhas signed bilateral investment agreements with 20 different nations,\nincluding many European countries, China, Egypt, Malaysia, and Yemen. In July\n2001, the United States and Algeria agreed on a framework for discussions\nleading to such an agreement, but a final treaty has not yet been negotiated.\nUltimately, trade liberalization, customs modernization, deregulation, and\nbanking reform are designed to improve the country's negotiating position as\nit seeks accession to the World Trade Organization.\n\nIn 2007 Algerian imports totaled US$26.08 billion. The principal imports were\ncapital goods, foodstuffs, and consumer goods. The top import partners were\nFrance (22 percent), Italy (8.6 percent), China (8.5 percent), Germany (5.9\npercent), Spain (5.9 percent), the United States (4.8 percent), and Turkey\n(4.5 percent). In 2007 Algeria exported US$63.3 billion, more than twice as\nmuch as it imported. Exports accounted for 30 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Hydrocarbon products constituted at least 95 percent of export\nearnings. The principal exports were petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum\nproducts. The top export partners were the United States (27.2 percent), Italy\n(17 percent), Spain (9.7 percent), France (8.8 percent), Canada (8.1 percent),\nand Belgium (4.3 percent). Algeria supplies 25 percent of the European Union's\nnatural gas imports. In 2007 Algeria posted a positive merchandise trade\nbalance of US$37.2 billion. In 2007 Algeria achieved a positive current\naccount balance of US$31.5 billion. High prices for Algeria's energy exports\nare the main driver for the improvement in the current account balance.\n\nAlgeria's trade surplus for 2010 rose to over $83.14 billion. The Algerian\nCentre for Information and Statistics Directorate of the Algerian Customs\nattribute this increase from the previous year to higher fuel revenue due to\nhigher prices for a barrel of oil, and a slight decrease in imports of\nconsumer non-food materials. The center said that Algerian exports rose by\n78.26% during the period from January to November 2010 from $27.51 billion to\n$44.4 billion during the same period in 2009. Imports grew by 89.1% from\n$43.36 billion to $76.35 billion between 2009 and 2010.\n\nReflecting strong oil export revenues, external debt is on a downward\ntrajectory. For example, these revenues facilitated early repayments of US$900\nmillion in loans from the African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia. In March\n2006, Algeria's purchase of 78 aircraft from Russia led to the cancellation of\nAlgeria's entire debt to Russia. In 2006 external debt was estimated at US$4.4\nbillion, down from US$23.5 billion in 2003.\n\nIn 2006 foreign direct investment (FDI) in Algeria totaled US$1.8 billion. The\npetrochemical, transport, and utilities sectors have been recent beneficiaries\nof FDI. FDI into the oil sector was expected to rise as a result of a\nhydrocarbons law, approved in April 2005, that created a more even playing\nfield for foreign oil companies to compete with Algeria's state-owned oil\ncompany, Sonatrach, for exploration and production contracts. Algeria also is\nseeking foreign investment in power and water systems.\n\nAs of August 2006, cumulative World Bank assistance to Algeria totaled US$5.9\nbillion, encompassing 72 projects. Currently, the World Bank is pursuing seven\nprojects, specifically budget modernization, mortgage finance, natural\ndisaster recovery, energy and mining, rural employment, telecommunications,\nand transportation. In 2005 economic assistance to Algeria from the United\nStates amounted to US$4.4 million, most of which was attributable to the\nMiddle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the remainder to International\nMilitary Education and Training (IMET). MEPI encourages economic, political,\nand educational reform in the Middle East. In 2006 IMET, which provides U.S.\nmilitary training to foreign troops, had a budget of US$823 million. In 2005\nthe European Union contributed US$58 million to Algeria's economic development\nunder the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
