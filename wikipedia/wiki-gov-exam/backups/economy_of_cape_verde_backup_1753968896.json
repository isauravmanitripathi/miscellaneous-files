Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,\nfinanced by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute\na supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new\ndemocratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and\nattracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Since 1991, the\npolicies the government has pursued include an open welcome to foreign\ninvestors and a far-reaching privatization program.\n\nFish and shellfish are plentiful, and small quantities are exported. Cape\nVerde has cold storage and freezing facilities as well as fish processing\nplants in Mindelo, Praia, and on Sal. However, the fishing potential, mostly\nlobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.\n\nThe economy is service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services\naccounting for almost 70% of the GDP. Although nearly 35% of the population\nlives in rural areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in 2010 was only 9.2%\n(up from 8.9% in 1995); of the 1998 total, fishing accounts for 1.5%.\n\nThe Cape Verdean government established the top priorities for development as\nthe promotion of a market economy and of the private sector; the development\nof tourism, light manufacturing industries, and fisheries; and the development\nof transport, communications, and energy facilities. In 1994-95 Cape Verde\nreceived a total of about U.S.$50 million in foreign investments, of which 50%\nwas in industry, 19% in tourism, and 31% in fisheries and services.
