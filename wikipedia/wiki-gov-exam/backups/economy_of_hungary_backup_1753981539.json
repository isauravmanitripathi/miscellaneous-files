Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( April 2025)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Hungary** is a developing, high-income mixed economy that is\nthe 53rd-largest economy in the world (out of 188 countries measured by IMF)\nwith $265.037 billion annual output, and ranks 41st in the world in terms of\nGDP per capita measured by purchasing power parity. Hungary has a very high\nhuman development index and a skilled labour force, with the 22nd lowest\nincome inequality by Gini index in the world. Hungary has an export-oriented\nmarket economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade; thus the country is the\n35th largest export economy in the world. The country had more than $100\nbillion of exports in 2015, with a high trade surplus of $9.003 billion, of\nwhich 79% went to the European Union (EU) and 21% was extra-EU trade.\nHungary's productive capacity is more than 80% privately owned, with 39.1%\noverall taxation, which funds the country's welfare economy.[_citation\nneeded_] On the expenditure side, household consumption is the main component\nof GDP and accounts for 50% of its total, followed by gross fixed capital\nformation with 22% and government expenditure with 20%.\n\nIn 2015 Hungary attracted $119.8 billion in FDI and invested more than $50\nbillion abroad. As of 2015, the key trading partners of Hungary were Germany,\nAustria, Romania, Slovakia, France, Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic.\nMajor industries include food processing, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles,\ninformation technology, chemicals, metallurgy, machinery, electrical goods,\nand tourism (in 2014 Hungary received 12.1 million international tourists).\nHungary is the largest electronics producer in Central and Eastern Europe.\nElectronics manufacturing and research are among the main drivers of\ninnovation and economic growth in the country. In the past 20 years Hungary\nhas also grown into a major center for mobile technology, information\nsecurity, and related hardware research. The employment rate in the economy\nwas 68.7% in January 2017, while the employment structure shows the\ncharacteristics of post-industrial economies. An estimated 63.2% of the\nemployed workforce work in the service sector, industry contributed by 29.7%,\nwhile agriculture employed 7.1%. The unemployment rate was 3.8% in\nSeptember–November 2017, down from 11% during the Great Recession. Hungary is\npart of the European single market, which represents more than 448 million\nconsumers. Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements\namong European Union members and by EU legislation.\n\nLarge Hungarian companies are included in the BUX, the Hungarian stock market\nindex listed on Budapest Stock Exchange. Well-known companies include\nGraphisoft, Magyar Telekom, MKB Bank, MOL Group, Opus Global, OTP Bank, RÁBA\nAutomotive Group, Gedeon Richter and Zwack Unicum. Hungary also has a large\nnumber of specialised small and medium enterprises, for example many\nautomotive industry suppliers and technology start ups.\n\nBudapest is the financial and business capital of Hungary. The capital is a\nsignificant economic hub, classified as an Alpha- world city in the study by\nthe Globalization and World Cities Research Network and it is the second\nfastest-developing urban economy in Europe. The per capita GDP in the city\nincreased by 2.4% and employment by 4.7% compared to the previous year, 2014.\nOn the national level, Budapest is the primary city of Hungary for business,\naccounting for 39% of the national income. The city had a gross metropolitan\nproduct of more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest\nregional economies in the European Union. Budapest is also among the top 100\nGDP performing cities in the world, as measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers. In\na global city competitiveness ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit,\nBudapest is ranked above Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg, among\nothers.\n\nHungary maintains its own currency, the Hungarian forint (HUF), although the\neconomy fulfills the Maastricht criteria with the exception of public debt.\nThe ratio of public debt to GDP is significantly below the EU average at 66.4%\nin 2019. The Hungarian National Bank was founded in 1924, after the\ndissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is currently focusing on price\nstability, with an inflation target of 3%.",

    "text": "From the late 1940s, the Communist government started to nationalize the\nindustry. At first, only factories with more than 100 workers were\nnationalized; later, this limit was reduced to only 10. In the agriculture,\nthe government started a successful program of collectivization. From the\nearly 1950s, more and more new factories were built. This rapid and forced\nindustrialization followed the standard Stalinist pattern in an effort to\nencourage a more self-sufficient economy. Most economic activity was conducted\nby state-owned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms. In 1968, Stalinist\nself-sufficiency was replaced by the \"New Economic Mechanism\", which reopened\nHungary to foreign trade, gave limited freedom to the workings of the market,\nand allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services\nsector.\n\nIn this era great social progress was made, for example the population between\n20 and 24 years old with less than 8 years of education decreased from 71.2%\nin 1949 to 4.9% in 1984, the annual consumption of meat and fish increased\nfrom 35 kilograms in 1950 to 78 in 1984, the percentage of homes with\nelectricity increased from 46.6% in 1949 to 99% in 1984, in the same period\nthe percentage of homes with running water increased from 17.1% to 76.6%, the\nnumber of cars per 1,000 people increased from 3 in 1960 to 122 in 1984, in\nthe case of televisions from 10 to 276, in the case of washing machines from\n45 to 317, in the case of refrigerators from 4 to 328, infant mortality (per\n1,000 live births) fell from 91 in 1949 to 20.4 in 1984.\n\nPer capita national income grew by 343% from 1950 to 1983 (4.6% per year),\nreal wages by 136% and real incomes by 251% over the same period,meanwhile\nreal value of per capita social benefits rose by 432% from 1960 to 1980. From\n1949 to 1984, Hungary's GDP grew as fast as that of countries like Spain.\n\nAlso poverty was greatly reduced,although from 1962 to 1982 the price index\nrose by 96%, people with less than 800 forints were 55% in 1962 and after 20\nyears only 6.4% of those with less than 1800 forints,In 1987, inequality was\nminimal, with a Gini coefficient of 0.21, and poverty was the same, with a 1%\npoverty rate (poverty line: $120 PPP per person per month).\n\nAlthough Hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced\neconomies of the former Eastern Bloc even though at the end of the 80s state\nemployment represented 94% of the total,both agriculture and industry began to\nsuffer from a lack of investment in the 1970s, and Hungary's net foreign debt\nrose significantly—from $1 billion in 1973 to $15 billion in 1993—due largely\nto consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises. In the face of\neconomic stagnation, Hungary opted to liberalize further by passing a joint\nventure law, instating an income tax, and joining the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and the World Bank. By 1988, Hungary had developed a two-tier\nbanking system, and had enacted significant corporate legislation that paved\nthe way for the ambitious market-oriented reforms of the post-communist years.",

    "text": "ING headquarters in Budapest\n\nAfter the fall of communism, the former Eastern Bloc had to transition from a\none-party, centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multi-party\npolitical system. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Eastern Bloc\ncountries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods, and\nsubsidizing from the Soviet Union. Hungary, for example, \"lost nearly 70% of\nits export markets in Eastern and Central Europe.\" The loss of external\nmarkets in Hungary left \"800,000 unemployed people because all the\nunprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed.\" Another form of\nSoviet subsidizing that greatly affected Hungary after the fall of communism\nwas the loss of social welfare programs. Because of the lack of subsidies and\na need to reduce expenditures, many social programs in Hungary had to be cut\nin an attempt to lower spending. As a result, many people in Hungary suffered\nincredible hardships during the transition to a market economy. Following\nprivatization and tax reductions on Hungarian businesses, unemployment\nsuddenly rose to 12% in 1991 (it was 1.7% in 1990 ), gradually decreasing\nuntil 2001. Economic growth, after a fall in 1991 to −11.9%, gradually grew\nuntil the end of the 1990s at an average annual rate of 4.2%. With the\nstabilization of the new market economy Hungary experienced growth in foreign\ninvestment, with a \"cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than\n$60 billion since 1989.\"\n\nThe Antall government of 1990–94 began market reforms with price and trade\nliberation measures, a revamped tax system, and a nascent market-based banking\nsystem. By 1994, however, the costs of government overspending and hesitant\nprivatization had become clearly visible. Cuts in consumer subsidies led to\nincreases in the price of food, medicine, transportation services, and energy.\nReduced exports to the former Soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output\ncontributed to a sharp decline in GDP. Unemployment rose rapidly to about 12%\nin 1993. The external debt burden, one of the highest in Europe, reached 250%\nof annual export earnings, while the budget and current account deficits\napproached 10% of GDP. The devaluation of the currency (in order to support\nexports), without effective stabilization measures, such as indexation of\nwages, provoked an extremely high inflation rate, that in 1991 reached 35% and\nslightly decreased until 1994, growing again in 1995. In March 1995, the\ngovernment of Prime Minister Gyula Horn implemented an austerity program,\ncoupled with aggressive privatization of state-owned enterprises and an\nexport-promoting exchange raw regime, to reduce indebtedness, cut the current\naccount deficit, and shrink public spending. By the end of 1997 the\nconsolidated public sector deficit decreased to 4.6% of GDP—with public sector\nspending falling from 62% of GDP to below 50%—the current account deficit was\nreduced to 2% of GDP, and government debt was paid down to 94% of annual\nexport earnings.[_citation needed_]\n\nMegyeri Bridge\n\nThe Government of Hungary no longer requires IMF financial assistance and has\nrepaid all of its debt to the fund. Consequently, Hungary enjoys favorable\nborrowing terms. Hungary's sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries\ninvestment-grade ratings from all major credit-rating agencies, although\nrecently the country was downgraded by Moody's, S&P and remains on negative\noutlook at Fitch. In 1995 Hungary's currency, the Forint (HUF), became\nconvertible for all current account transactions, and subsequent to OECD\nmembership in 1996, for almost all capital account transactions as well. Since\n1995, Hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies (in which\nthe U.S. dollar is 30%), and the central rate against the basket is devalued\nat a preannounced rate, originally set at 0.8% per month, the Forint is now an\nentirely free-floating currency. The government privatization program ended on\nschedule in 1998: 80% of GDP is now produced by the private sector, and\nforeign owners control 70% of financial institutions, 66% of industry, 90% of\ntelecommunications, and 50% of the trading sector.[_citation needed_]\n\nKőröshegy Viaduct\n\nAfter Hungary's GDP declined about 18% from 1990 to 1993 and grew only 1%–1.5%\nup to 1996, strong export performance propelled GDP growth to 4.4% in 1997,\nwith other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving. These successes\nallowed the government to concentrate in 1996 and 1997 on major structural\nreforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system (partly\nmodelled after Chile's pension system with major modifications), reform of\nhigher education, and the creation of a national treasury. Remaining economic\nchallenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation, maintaining stable\nexternal balances, and completing structural reforms of the tax system, health\ncare, and local government financing. Recently, the overriding goal of\nHungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the\nEuropean Union, which it joined in late 2004.\n\nPrior to the change of regime in 1989, 65% of Hungary's trade was with Comecon\ncountries. By the end of 1997, Hungary had shifted much of its trade to the\nWest. Trade with EU countries now comprises 80% of the total. Germany is\nHungary's single most important trading partner. The US has become Hungary's\nsixth-largest export market, while Hungary is ranked as the 72nd largest\nexport market for the U.S. Bilateral trade between the two countries increased\n46% in 1997 to more than $1 billion. The U.S. has extended to Hungary most-\nfavored-nation status, the Generalized System of Preferences, Overseas Private\nInvestment Corporation insurance, and access to the Export-Import\nBank.[_citation needed_]\n\nWith about $18 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) since 1989, Hungary\nhas attracted over one-third of all FDI in central and eastern Europe,\nincluding the former Soviet Union. Of this, about $6 billion came from\nAmerican companies. Foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively\ninexpensive labor, tax incentives, modern infrastructure, and a good\ntelecommunications system.[_citation needed_]\n\nBy 2006 Hungary's economic outlook had deteriorated. Wage growth had kept up\nwith other nations in the region; however, this growth has largely been driven\nby increased government spending. This resulted in the budget deficit\nballooning to over 10% of GDP and inflation rates predicted to exceed 6%.\nNouriel Roubini, an economist in the Clinton administration, said that\n\"Hungary is an accident waiting to happen.\"",

The Danube also\nflows through parts of Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Serbia, and Romania. It is\nnavigable within Hungary for 418 km. The Tisza River is navigable for 444 km\nin the country. Hungary has three major lakes. Lake Balaton, the largest, is\n78 km long and from 3 to 14 km wide, with an area of 592 km2. Lake Balaton is\nCentral Europe's largest lake and a prosperous tourist spot and recreation\narea. Its shallow waters offer summer bathing and during the winter its frozen\nsurface provides facilities for winter sports. Smaller bodies of water include\nLake Velence (26 km2) in Fejér County and Lake Fertő (82 km2 within Hungary).\n\nThe waters of the country are in danger, since more water is going out of the\ncounty than in. In 2022, a severe drought which has impacted all of Europe is\nendangering among others, Lake Velence, Lake Balaton, the Danube and Tisza\nrivers. The flow of the aforementioned rivers have been modified in the late\n19th century, and while it prevented larger floods and helped water transport,\nit has its downsides, such as the inability to support large-scale watering of\ncrops, worsening the drought of 2022.

The graph on the\nright shows that Hungary is close in equality to the world-leader Denmark. The\nhighest 10% of the population gets 22.2% of the incomes. According to the\nbusiness magazine _Napi Gazdaság_ , the owner of the biggest fortune, 300\nbillion HUF, is Sándor Demján. On the other hand, the lowest 10% gets 4% of\nthe incomes. Considering the standard EU indicators (Percentage of the\npopulation living under 60% of the per capita median income), 13% of the\nHungarian population is stricken by poverty. According to the Human\nDevelopment Report, the country's HPI-1 value is 2.2% (3rd among 135\ncountries), and its HDI value is 0.879 (43rd out of 182).\n\nPopulation pyramid of Hungary\n\nThe fertility rate in Hungary, just like in many European countries, is very\nlow: 1.34 children/women (205th in the world) Life expectancy at birth is 73.3\nyears., while the expected number of healthy years is 57.6 for females and\n53.5 for males.

Although the definition of the Roma identity is controversial,\nqualitative studies prove that the Roma employment rate decreased\nsignificantly following the fall of Communism: due to the tremendous layoffs\nof unskilled workers during the transition years, more than one-third of Roma\nwere excluded from the labour market. Therefore, this ethnic conflict is\ninherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country – at\nleast two-thirds of the poorest 300,000 people in Hungary are Romas.\nFurthermore, ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high, 32% of Romas\nexperience discrimination when looking for work. Consequently, new Roma\nentrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment, which\ncreates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and\nunemployment.",

Among the total tax income\nthe ratio of local taxes is solely 5% while the EU average is 30%. Until 2010,\nthe taxation of an individual was progressive, determining the tax rate based\non the individual's income: with earning up to 1,900,000 forints a year, the\ntax was 18%, the tax on incomes above this limit was 36% since 1 July 2009.\n\nBased on the new one-rate tax regime introduced January 2011, the overall tax\nrate for all income-earnings bands has been 16%. According to the income-tax\nreturns of 2008, 14,6% of taxpayers was charged for 64,5% of the total tax\nburdens. Before the new corporate income tax regime, the corporate tax was\nfixed at 16% of the positive rateable value, with an additional tax called\nsolidarity tax of 4%, the measure of which is calculated based on the result\nbefore tax of the company (the solidarity tax has been in use since September,\n2006). The actual rateable value might be different is the two cases. From\nJanuary 2011, under the new corporate income tax regime the tax rate was\ndivided into two parts (i) corporations having income before tax below 500\nmillion HUF (appr. USD 2.5 million) was lowered to 10% and (ii) 16% remained\nfor all other companies until 2013. After this, the unified corporate income\ntax rate will be 10%, irrespectively from the size of the net income before\ntax.
