    "text": "The **economy of Botswana** is currently one of the world's fastest growing\neconomies, averaging about 5% per annum over the past decade. Growth in\nprivate sector employment averaged about 10% per annum during the first 30\nyears of the country's independence. After a period of stagnation at the turn\nof the 21st century, Botswana's economy registered strong levels of growth,\nwith GDP growth exceeding 6–7% targets. Botswana has been praised by the\nAfrican Development Bank for sustaining one of the world's longest economic\nbooms. Economic growth since the late 1960s has been on par with some of\nAsia's largest economies. The government has consistently maintained budget\nsurpluses and has extensive foreign-exchange reserves.\n\nBotswana's impressive economic record compared to some of its neighbors has\nbeen built on a foundation of diamond mining, prudent fiscal policies, and a\ncautious foreign policy. Botswana's economy is mostly dependent on diamond\nmining. Diamond mining contributes to 50% of the government revenue mainly\nthrough its 50:50 joint venture with De Beers in the Debswana Diamond Company.\nAs of 2020, it is rated as the third least corrupt country in Africa in the\nCorruption Perceptions Index by international corruption watchdog Transparency\nInternational. It has the fourth highest gross national income per capita in\npurchasing power in Africa and above the world average.\n\nTrade unions represent a minority of workers in the Botswana economy. In\ngeneral they are loosely organised \"in-house\" unions, although the Botswana\nFederation of Trade Unions (BFTU) is consolidating its role as the sole\nnational trade union centre in the country.\n\nAlthough Botswana's economy is considered a model for countries in the region,\nits overreliance on mining and its high rate of HIV/AIDS infection (one in\nevery three adults is seropositive) and unemployment may threaten its future\nsuccess. Botswana has become the first high-burden country to be certified for\nachieving an important milestone on the path to eliminating mother-to-child\ntransmission of HIV by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

    "text": "The Jwaneng diamond mine is the second biggest in the world today.\n\nSince early 1980s, the country has been one of the world's largest producers\nof gem diamonds. Eight large diamond mines have opened since Botswana's\nindependence. De Beers prospectors discovered diamonds in northern Botswana in\nthe early 1970s. The first mine began production at Orapa in 1972, followed by\na smaller mine at Letlhakane. What has become the single-richest diamond mine\nin the world opened in Jwaneng in 1982. The mine was discovered when termites\nlooking for water brought grains of diamond to the surface. Botswana produced\na total of 24 million carats of diamonds from Debswana in 2022, and is the\nhighest producer of diamonds by value in the world as of 2023. The Orapa 2000\nExpansion of the existing Orapa mine was opened in 2000. According to\nDebswana, the Orapa 2000 Expansion project increase the Orapa's mine annual\noutput from 6 million carats to 12 million carats and raised total production\nto 26 million carats. In 2003, Debswana opened the Damtshaa diamond mine about\n220 kilometers (140 mi) west of the city of Francistown. The mine was placed\ninto care and maintenance in December 2015 due to weak global demand but was\nscheduled to reopen in January 2018. In 2008, Australia's Kimberley Diamond\nCompany opened a mine in Lerala, Botswana's fifth mine and the first not\noperated by Debswana. However, Kimberley shut down the mine in May 2017,\nciting weak market conditions.\n\nMost of Botswana's electricity is imported from South Africa's Eskom. Debswana\noperates the nearby Morupule Colliery to supply coal to it. Botswana exported\n$3.12k worth of electricity from 2021 to 2022, all going to Zimbabwe. In early\n2008, the entire southern African region was hit hard by massive shortages of\npower, since the region works to share its power resources through the\nSouthern African Power Pool, with most of its capacity coming from South\nAfrica. Botswana has in turn put in place plans to become a net exporter of\npower to the regional pool, through governmental expansion of the Morupule\npower station, as well as encouraging private investment in the form of a 4\ngigawatt power station by the Canadian greenfield company CIC Energy. In 2012,\nCIC Energy was acquired by India's Jindal Steel and Power. Jindal Africa\ncurrently aims to operate three surface mines in the coalfields of Mmamabula,\nas well as a power plant. According to the company, \"the mine’s development\nwill meet the demands of 600MW power stations and export region coal markets,\nwith the potential to employ more than 2,000 people.\"\n\nBotswana also produces soda ash through Botash, a joint venture between the\ngovernment and South Africa's Chlor-Alkali Holdings (CAH) Group. Botash has\nbeen operating in the Sua Pan in northeastern Botswana since April 1991.",

    "text": "I-Towers, Gaborone Central Business District\n\nBotswana seeks to diversify its economy away from minerals, the earnings from\nwhich have levelled off.\n\nExternal investment in Botswana has grown fitfully. In the early 1990s, two\nAmerican companies, Owens Corning and H.J. Heinz, made major investments in\nproduction facilities in Botswana. In 1997, the St. Paul Group purchased\nBotswana Insurance, one of the country's leading short-term insurance\nproviders. An American Business Council (ABC), with over 30 member companies,\nwas inaugurated in 1995. Hyundai operated a car assembly plant in Botswana\nfrom 1994 to 2000.\n\nTourist resort at Kasane\n\nBotswana seeks to further diversify its economy away from minerals, which\naccount for a quarter of GDP, down from nearly half of GDP in the early 1990s.\nForeign investment and management are welcomed in Botswana and, as a result,\nthe financial and services sectors have increased at an exponential rate in\nthe 2000s to replace mining as the leading industry. Botswana abolished\nforeign exchange controls in 1999, has a low corporate tax rate (15%), no\nprohibitions on foreign ownership of companies, and as of January 2024 it is\nroughly 4%\n\nThe government considers private-sector participation as being critical to the\nsuccess of the country's _Tenth National Development Plan_ (2009–2016) and\nenhancing the role of research and development as being the most effective way\nto nurture entrepreneurship and private-sector growth. The government is\nconsidering additional policies to enhance competitiveness, including a new\nForeign Direct Investment Strategy, Competition Policy, Privatisation Master\nPlan and National Export Development Strategy.\n\nBotswana is known to have vast coal deposits making it possibly one of the\nmost coal-rich countries in the world. Large coal mines, massive coal-fired\npower plants, as well as a coals to liquid plant (through the Fischer–Tropsch\nprocess) to produce synthetic automotive fuel have been planned.\n\nWith its proven record of good economic governance, Botswana was ranked as\nAfrica's third least corrupt country in the Corruption Perceptions Index in\n2020, ahead of many European and Asian countries. The World Economic Forum\nrated Botswana as the third most economically competitive nation in Africa in\n2002. However, Botswana is not a member of the WEF anymore. In 2001 Botswana\nwas once again assigned \"A\" grade credit ratings by Moody's and Standard &\nPoor's. This ranks Botswana as by far the best credit risk in Africa and puts\nit on par with or above many countries in central Europe, East Asia, and Latin\nAmerica. However, as of 2024, Botswana has been ranked BBB+ in S&P's rating,\nwhile being ranked A3 in Moody's grade credit rating.\n\nU.S. investment in Botswana remains at relatively low levels but continues to\ngrow. Major U.S. corporations, such as Coca-Cola and H.J. Heinz, are present\nthrough direct investments, while others, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, are\npresent via franchise. The sovereign credit ratings by Moody's and Standard &\nPoor's clearly indicate that, despite continued challenges such as small\nmarket size, landlocked location, and cumbersome bureaucratic processes,\nBotswana remains one of the best investment opportunities in the developing\nworld.\n\nDue to its history and geography, Botswana has long and deep ties to the\neconomy of South Africa. The Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), presently\ncomprising Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, and South Africa, dates from\n1910. Under this arrangement, South Africa has collected levies from customs,\nsales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on\neach country's portion of imports. The exact formula for sharing revenues and\nthe decision-making authority over duties—held exclusively by the Government\nof South Africa—became increasingly controversial, and the members\nrenegotiated the arrangement in 2001. The new structure has now been formally\nratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in Windhoek, Namibia.\nFollowing South Africa's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nBotswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making\nproducts from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently, the\nSACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana\nis currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with Mercosur and an\nEconomic Partnership Agreement with the European Union as part of SADC.\n\nAerial view over Okavango Delta\n\nGaborone is host to the headquarters of the fourteen-nation Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC), a successor to the Southern African Development\nCoordination Conference (SADCC, established in 1980), which focused its\nefforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid\nSouth Africa. SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in\n1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic\nintegration in Southern Africa. SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1\nSeptember 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff\nbarriers to trade by 2012 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it\nwill give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market.\n\nBotswana has successfully carried an Action Programme on the Elimination of\nChild Labour, which was adopted in the period 2006–2007. Free the Children\ndelisted Botswana as a nation harbouring child-labour facilities in 2008."

    "text": "Botswana has a growing financial sector, and the country's national stock\nmarket, the Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE), based in Gaborone, is given the\nresponsibility to operate and regulate the equities and fixed interest\nsecurities market. Formally established in 1989, the BSE continues to be\npivotal to Botswana's financial system, and in particular the capital market,\nas an avenue on which government, quasi-government and the private sector can\nraise debt and equity capital. Although the BSE has just under 40 companies\nlisted, it plays host to the most pre-eminent companies doing business in\nBotswana. These companies represent a spectrum of industries and commerce,\nfrom Banking and financial services to Wholesaling and Retailing, Tourism and\nInformation Technology.\n\nBotswana's currency, the pula, is fully convertible and is valued against a\nbasket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African Rand. Profits\nand direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana.\nThe Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999. The Central\nBank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export\ncompetitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further\n12% devaluation 1 year later in 2005 and the policy of a \"Crawling peg\" was\nadopted.\n\nThe recently established Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority\n(NBFIRA) is responsible for the oversight of all non-banking financial\nservices entities in the country. As of 2020, about 82% of Botswana's\npopulation had access to formal or informal financial services. Mobile banking\nservices have just started to be offered. In recent years the government and\nCentral Bank have undertaken serious steps to modernize the country's payment\nsystem infrastructure. These efforts included the establishment of a code-line\nclearing system for the exchange of cheques and electronic funds as well as a\nReal Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, including SWIFT connection.\n\nGaborone is host to the headquarters of the 14-nation Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC). A successor to the Southern African Development\nCoordination Conference (SADCC), which focused its efforts on freeing regional\neconomic development from dependence on apartheid in South Africa, SADC\nembraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad\nmandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern\nAfrica. SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls\nfor the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2012\namong the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana\ncompanies free access to the far larger regional market. The Regional Centre\nfor Southern Africa (RCSA), which implements the U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment's (USAID) Initiative for Southern Africa (ISA), is headquartered\nin Gaborone as well."
