    "text": "Cocoa factory (2008)\n\nPre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard\ncurrency earnings. In 1959 it had the highest per capita income of Africa\nwhich it still has, after several decades as one of the poorest countries in\nthe world.\n\nThe discovery of large oil reserves in 1996 and their subsequent exploitation\nhave contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. As of 2004,\nEquatorial Guinea was the third-largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nIts oil production had then risen to 360,000 barrels per day (57,000 m3/d), up\nfrom 220,000 barrels per day (35,000 m3/d) only two years earlier.\n\nForestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence\nfarming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on\ncocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy\nunder successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth.\nHowever, the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue\ninto agriculture.[_citation needed_] A number of aid programs sponsored by the\nWorld Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and\nmismanagement. No longer eligible for concessional financing because of large\noil revenues, the government has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a\n\"shadow\" fiscal management program with the World Bank and IMF. Businesses,\nfor the most part, are owned by government officials and their family members.\nUndeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium,\nand alluvial gold (Mining in Equatorial Guinea). Growth remained strong in\n2005 and 2006, led by oil.[_citation needed_]",

    "text": "Oil and gas exports have increased substantially and will drive the economy\nfor years to come. Real GDP growth reached 23% in 1999, and initial estimates\nsuggested growth of about 15% in 2001, according to IMF 2001 forecast. Per\ncapita income grew from about $1,000 in 1998 to about $2,000 in 2000. The\nenergy export sector is responsible for this rapid growth. Oil production has\nincreased from 81,000 barrels per day (12,900 m3/d) to 210,000 barrels per day\n(33,000 m3/d) between 1998 and early 2001. There is ongoing additional\ndevelopment of existing commercially viable oil and gas deposits as well as\nnew exploration in other offshore concessions.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has other largely unexploited human and natural resources,\nincluding a tropical climate, fertile soils, rich expanses of water, deepwater\nports, and an untapped, if unskilled, source of labor. Following independence\nin 1968, the country suffered under a repressive dictatorship for 11 years,\nwhich devastated the economy. The agricultural sector, which historically was\nknown for cocoa of the highest quality, has never fully recovered. In 1969\nEquatorial Guinea produced 36,161 tons of highly bid cocoa, but production\ndropped to 4,800 tons in 2000. Coffee production also dropped sharply during\nthis period to bounce back to 100,000 metric tons in 2000. Timber is the main\nsource of foreign exchange after oil, accounting for about 12.4% of total\nexport earnings in 1996–99. Timber production increased steadily during the\n1990s; wood exports reached a record 789,000 cubic meters in 1999 as demand in\nAsia (mainly China) gathered pace after the 1998 economic crisis. Most of the\nproduction (mainly Okoume) goes to exports, and only 3% is processed locally.\nEnvironmentalists fear that exploitation at this level is unsustainable and\npoint out to the permanent damage already inflicted on the forestry reserves\non Bioko.\n\nConsumer price inflation has declined from the 38.8% experienced in 1994\nfollowing the CFA franc devaluation, to 7.8% in 1998, and 1.0% in 1999,\naccording to BEAC data. Consumer prices rose about 6% in 2000, according to\ninitial estimates, and there was anecdotal evidence that price inflation was\naccelerating in 2001.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's policies, as defined by law, comprise an open investment\nregime. Qualitative restrictions on imports, non-tariff protection, and many\nimport licensing requirements were lifted when in 1992 the government adopted\na public investment program endorsed by the World Bank. The Government of the\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea has sold some state enterprises. It is\nattempting to create a more favourable investment climate, and its investment\ncode contains numerous incentives for job creation, training, promotion of\nnon-traditional exports, support of development projects and indigenous\ncapital participation, freedom for repatriation of profits, exemption from\ncertain taxes and capital, and other benefits. Trade regulations have been\nfurther liberalized since implementation in 1994 of the ICN turnover tax, in\nconformity with Central African tax and custom reform codes. The reform\nincluded elimination of quota restrictions and reductions in the range and\namounts of tariffs. The CEMAC countries agreed to replace the ICN with a value\nadded tax (VAT) in 1999.\n\nWhile business laws promote a liberalized economy, the business climate\nremains difficult. Application of the laws remains selective. Corruption among\nofficials is widespread, and many business deals are concluded under non-\ntransparent circumstances.\n\nThere is little industry in the country, and the local market for industrial\nproducts is small. The government seeks to expand the role of free enterprise\nand to promote foreign investment but has had little success in creating an\natmosphere conducive to investor interest.\n\nThe Equatorial-Guinea budget has grown enormously in the past 3 years as\nroyalties and taxes on foreign company oil and gas production have provided\nnew resources to a once poor government. The 2001 budget foresaw revenues of\nabout 154 billion CFA francs (154 GCFAF) (about U.S.$200 million), up about\n50% from 2000 levels. Oil revenues account for about two-thirds of government\nrevenue, and VAT and trade taxes are the other large revenue sources.\n\nYear 2001 government expenditures were planned to reach 158 billion CFA\nfrancs, up about 50% from 2000 levels. New investment projects represented\nabout 40% of the budget, and personnel and internal and external debt payments\nrepresented about one-third of planned expenditures.\n\nThe Equatorial-Guinea Government has undertaken a number of reforms since 1991\nto reduce its predominant role in the economy and promote private sector\ndevelopment. Its role is a diminishing one, although many government\ninteractions with the private sector are at times capricious. Beginning in\nearly 1997, the government initiated efforts to attract significant private\nsector involvement through a Corporate Council on Africa visit and numerous\nministerial efforts. In 1998, the government privatized distribution of\npetroleum products. There are now Total and Mobil stations in the country. The\ngovernment has expressed interest in privatizing the outmoded electricity\nutility. A French company operates cellular telephone service in cooperation\nwith a state enterprise. The government is anxious for greater U.S.\ninvestment, and President Obiang visited the U.S. three times between 1999 and\n2001 to encourage greater U.S. corporate interest. Investment in agriculture,\nfishing, livestock, and tourism are among sectors the government would like\ntargeted.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's balance-of-payments situation has improved substantially\nsince the mid-1990s because of new oil and gas production and favorable world\nenergy prices. Exports totaled about francs CFA 915 billion in 2000 (1.25\nG$US), up from CFA 437 billion (700 M$US) in 1999. Crude oil exports accounted\nfor more than 90% of export earnings in 2000. Timber exports, by contrast,\nrepresented only about 5% of export revenues in 2000. Additional oil\nproduction coming on line in 2001, combined with methanol gas exports from the\nnew CMS-Nomeco plant, should increase export earnings substantially.\n\nImports into Equatorial Guinea also are growing very quickly. Imports totaled\nfrancs CFA 380 billion (530 M$US), up from franc CFA 261 million (420 M$US) in\n1999. Imports of equipment used for the oil and gas sector accounted for about\nthree-quarters of imports in 2000. Imports of capital equipment for public\ninvestment projects reached francs CFA 30 billion in 2000, up 40% from 1999\nlevels.\n\nEquatorial Guinea's foreign debt stock was approximately francs CFA 69 billion\n(100 M$US) in 2000, slightly less than the debt stock in 1999, according to\nBEAC data. Equatorial Guinea's debt service ratio fell from 20% of GDP in 1994\nto only 1% in 2000. Foreign exchange reserves were increasing slightly,\nalthough they were relatively low in terms of import coverage. According to\nthe terms of the franc CFA zone, some of these reserves are kept in an account\nwith the French Ministry of Finance.\n\nEquatorial Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s received foreign assistance from\nnumerous bilateral and multilateral donors, including European countries, the\nUnited States, and the World Bank. Many of these aid programs have ceased\naltogether or have diminished. Spain, France, and the European Union continue\nto provide some project assistance, as do China and Cuba. The government also\nhas discussed working with World Bank assistance to develop government\nadministrative capacity.\n\nEquatorial Guinea operated under an IMF-negotiated Enhanced Structural\nAdjustment Facility (ESAF) until 1996. Since then, there have been no formal\nagreements or arrangements. The International monetary Fund held Article IV\nconsultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August\n1999. After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for\nEquatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and\nmore transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy\nsector revenue. IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data.\nIn 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed\nrequirements, maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives.\nHowever, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving\nfiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.[_citation needed_]",

    "text": "Malabo International Airport (_Aeropuerto de Malabo_ in Spanish), en Punta\nEuropa, island of Bioko\n\nInfrastructure is generally old and in poor condition. As of 2002[update],\nsurface transport is extremely limited, with little more than 700 kilometres\nof paved roads. The African Development Bank is helping to improve the paved\nroads from Malabo to Luba and Riaba; the Chinese are undertaking a project to\nlink Mongomo to Bata on the mainland, and the European Union is financing an\ninter-states road network linking Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon and Gabon.\nRoad maintenance is often inadequate.\n\nElectricity is available in Equatorial Guinea's larger towns thanks to three\nsmall overworked hydropower facilities and a number of aged generators. In\n1999, national production was about 13 MWh. In Malabo, the American company,\nCMS-Nomeco, built a 10 megawatt electricity plant financed by the government,\nwhich came in line in mid-2000, and plans to double capacity are advancing.\nThis plant provides improved service to the capital, although there are still\noccasional outages. On the mainland the largest city, Bata, still has regular\nblackouts.\n\nThe port of Malabo\n\nWater is only available in the major towns and is not always reliable because\nof poor maintenance and mismanagement. Some villages and rural areas are\nequipped with generators and water pumps, usually owned by private\nindividuals.\n\nParastatal Getesa, a joint venture with a minority ownership stake held by a\nFrench subsidiary of Orange, provides telephone service in the major cities.\nThe regular system is overextended, but Orange has introduced a popular GSM\nsystem, which is generally reliable in Malabo and Bata.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has two of the deepest Atlantic seaports of the region,\nincluding the main business and commercial port city of Bata. The ports of\nboth Malabo and Bata are severely overextended and require extensive\nrehabilitation and reconditioning. The British company, Incat, has an ongoing\nproject with the government to renovate and expand Luba, the country's third-\nlargest port which is located on Bioko Island. The government hopes Luba will\nbecome a major transportation hub for offshore oil and gas companies operating\nin the Gulf of Guinea. Luba is located some 50 kilometres from Malabo and had\nbeen virtually inactive except for minor fishing activities and occasional use\nto ease congestion in Malabo. A new jetty is also being built at km 5 on the\nway from Malabo to the airport.[_citation needed_] It is a project mainly\nsupposed to service the oil industry, but can also relieve the congested\nMalabo Port due to its closeness. The Oil Jetty at km 5 was supposed to open\nthe end of March 2003. Riaba is the other port of any scale on Bioko but is\nless active. The continental ports of Mbini and Cogo have deteriorated as well\nand are now used primarily for timber activities.[_citation needed_]\n\nThere are both air and sea connections between the two cities of Malabo and\nBata.[_citation needed_] As of 2002, a few aging Soviet-built aircraft\nconstituted the national air fleet. Since then, most Soviet-built aircraft\nhave been replaced by ATR and Boeing.[_citation needed_] The runway at Malabo\n(3,200 m) is equipped with lights and can service aircraft similar to Boeing\n777s and Ilyushin Il-76s. The one at Bata (2,400 m) does not operate at night\nbut can accommodate aircraft as large as Boeing 737s. Their primary users are\nthe national airline (EGA) and a private company (GEASA). Two minor airstrips\n(800 m) are located at Mongomo and Annobon. There are international\nconnections out of Malabo to Madrid and Zürich in Europe and to Cotonou,\nDouala and Libreville in West Africa."

    "text": "After a slow start, Equatorial Guinea has recently (as of 2002) emerged as a\nmajor oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most promising\nhydrocarbon regions in the world. The main oil fields, Zafiro and Alba, both\nlie offshore of Bioko island. In 1999 oil production was about five times its\n1996 level; Zafiro Field, operated by ExxonMobil and Ocean Energy, produced\nabout 100,000 barrels per day (16,000 m3/d), and CMS Nomeco extracted\napproximately 6,700 barrels per day (1,070 m3/d). In 2002, production was\nnearly 200,000 barrels per day.\n\nIn 1995 Mobil (now ExxonMobil) discovered the large Zafiro field, with\nestimated reserves of 400,000,000 barrels (64,000,000 m3). Production began in\n1996. The company announced a 3-year U.S.$1bn rapid-development program to\nboost output to 130,000 barrels per day (21,000 m3/d) by early 2001. Progress\nwas delayed due to a contractual dispute with the government and by\nunexpectedly difficult geology. The difference with the government was\neventually resolved.\n\nIn 1998 a more liberal regulatory and profit-sharing arrangement for\nhydrocarbon exploration and production activities was introduced. It revised\nand updated the production-sharing contract, which, until then, had favoured\nWestern operators heavily. As a result, domestic oil receipts rose from 13% to\n20% of oil export revenue. However, the government's share remains relatively\npoor by international standards.\n\nIn 1997 CMS Nomeco moved to expand its operation with a U.S.$300m methanol\nplant. The plant entered production in 2000 and helped boost natural gas\ncondensate output from Alba field.\n\nIn August 1999 the government closed bidding on a new petroleum-licensing\nround for 53 unexplored deepwater blocks and seven shallow-water blocks. The\nresponse was small due to a combination of factors, including falling oil\nprices, restructuring within the oil industry, and uncertainty over an\nundemarcated maritime border with Nigeria (which was not resolved until 2000).\n\nIn late 1999 Triton Energy, a U.S. independent, discovered La Ceiba in block G\nin an entirely new area offshore the mainland of the country. Triton expected\na U.S.$200m development program to enable La Ceiba and associated fields to\nproduce 100,000 barrels per day (16,000 m3/d) by late 2001, despite\ndisappointments and technical problems at the beginning of the year.\n\nWith an upturn in oil prices, exploration intensified in 2000. In April 2000\nU.S.-based Vanco Energy signed a production-sharing contract for the offshore\nblock of Corisco Deep. In May 2000, Chevron was granted block L, offshore Río\nMuni, and a further three production-sharing contracts (for blocks J, I, and\nH) were signed with Atlas Petroleum, a Nigerian company.\n\nIn early 2001 the government announced plans to establish a national oil\ncompany, to allow Equatorial Guinea to take a greater stake in the sector and\nto facilitate the more rapid transfer of skills. However, critics fear that\nsuch a company may become a vehicle for opaque accounting and inertia of the\nsort that has hindered development in neighbouring countries including Angola,\nCameroon, and Nigeria.\n\nSince 2001 the government has created GEPetrol, a national oil company; and\nSonagas, a national natural-gas company. The company EG LNG has been created\nto construct and operate the Bioko Island LNG plant and terminal. The plant\nbegan to operate in May 2007 and a second plant is now[_when?_] under\ndevelopment.\n\nEquatorial Guinea became a member of OPEC in May 2017."
