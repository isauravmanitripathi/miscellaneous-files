    "text": "Overview of the economy of Kyrgyzstan\n\nThe **economy of Kyrgyzstan** is primarily driven by trade, light\nmanufacturing, mining, and agriculture. As a landlocked, lower-middle-income\ncountry in Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan possesses abundant natural resources and\nconsiderable potential in sectors such as hydroelectric power, agriculture,\nand tourism.\n\nMining, particularly gold extraction, plays a pivotal role. The Kumtor mine\nstands out as one of the largest gold deposits in the region. Beyond gold,\nKyrgyzstan is rich in critical raw materials essential for modern\ntechnologies. Notably, the country holds significant antimony reserves, a\nmineral vital for electronics and defense industries.\n\nThe services sector, particularly trade and transportation, has grown\nsteadily, driven by strengthening economic ties with China. After the 2022\nsanctions on Russia, several regional supply routes were redirected through\nKyrgyzstan, boosting economic growth. Kyrgyzstan sustained strong annual GDP\ngrowth of 9% in each of the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. These changes\nhighlight Kyrgyzstan’s strategic importance in Central Asia and its emerging\nrole in regional trade and infrastructure networks.\n\nThe government is embarking on several large infrastructure megaprojects,\nnotably the Kambarata-1 Hydropower Plant and the China–Kyrgyzstan–Uzbekistan\nrailway — an integral part of the Belt and Road Initiative — which have the\npotential to significantly reshape the country’s economic landscape.\n\nKyrgyzstan’s long-term growth is supported by favorable demographics, with the\npopulation increasing by 2% annually over the past decade to reach 7.3 million\nin 2025. However, limited domestic employment opportunities continue to drive\nlabor migration, primarily to Russia. On a positive note, the economy’s\nreliance on remittances — currently around 14.6% of GDP — has fallen sharply\nfrom a peak of 35%."

    "text": "Kyrgyzstan’s trade landscape has evolved significantly in recent years, marked\nby substantial growth in exports and a notable shift in trade partnerships. In\n2024, Kyrgyzstan’s total exports reached $3.8 billion, representing a 13%\nincrease compared to 2023. The nation’s principal exports include gold, coal,\ncopper ores, clothing, electronics, and footwear. Gold remains the dominant\nexport commodity, with the Kumtor Gold Mine playing a pivotal role in\nproduction.\n\nZhongda Oil Refinery in Kyrgyzstan\n\nA significant development in Kyrgyzstan’s export profile is the surge in fuel\nexports to Afghanistan. In 2024, Kyrgyzstan exported over 40 million liters of\nrefined petroleum to Afghanistan, a dramatic increase from the 384,000 liters\nexported in 2022. Beyond fuel, Kyrgyzstan’s exports to Afghanistan encompass a\nrange of goods, including agricultural products (such as dried legumes and\nflour), construction materials (like cement and metal structures), and\nmachinery and equipment. In 2024, total exports to Afghanistan amounted to $50\nmillion, underscoring the growing economic ties between the two nations.\n\nKyrgyzstan’s key imports include refined petroleum, industrial machinery and\nequipment, cars and automotive parts, chemical products, fabrics and textiles,\nand a broad range of foodstuffs. In 2024, total imports reached $12.5 billion,\nwith a significant portion of these goods being re-exported.\n\nKyrgyzstan’s current account deficit in 2024 stood at 6% of GDP, a figure\nadjusted to account for actual re-exports within the EAEU that are not\nrecorded in official export data."

    "text": "Kyrgyzstan’s membership in both the World Trade Organization (since 1998) and\nthe Eurasian Economic Union (since 2015) allows it to serve as a strategic\ntransit hub in Eurasian trade. The country operates as a **re-export\nplatform** , particularly for goods from China, Türkiye, South Korea and the\nUAE, which are imported at low WTO tariffs and re-exported to other EAEU\ncountries — primarily Russia and Kazakhstan — without additional duties or\ncustoms controls.\n\nThis arrangement creates a form of tariff arbitrage, as Kyrgyzstan’s lower\nexternal tariff regime enables goods to enter the EAEU more cheaply than\nthrough other member states. The significance of this role has increased since\n2022, as Western sanctions on Russia prompted a surge in parallel imports\nthrough Kyrgyz territory. This has generated robust economic growth and strong\nfiscal outcomes. Given that Kyrgyzstan, like Russia, is part of the Eurasian\nEconomic Union (EAEU) customs free zone, trade statistics do not fully capture\nits exports to other EAEU countries because there is no requirement for\nconventional customs declarations for goods crossing the border. This\ncomplicates the task of directly estimating re-exports through Kyrgyzstan.\n\nFrom 2021-2024, the Kyrgyzstan's goods imports more than doubled, to $12.5\nbillion from $5.2 billion, almost entirely owing to imports of machinery and\ntransport equipment, including passenger cars. By country, China accounts for\nalmost 60% of this upswing, while European countries account for 8%. Most of\nthese additional imports have limited links with the Kyrgyz economy and are in\nall likelihood re-exported to Russia, alongside other EAEU countries. The re-\nexport model supports a range of domestic sectors, including logistics,\nwarehousing, transportation, customs brokerage, and wholesale trade.\n\nIn August 2024, the Kyrgyz government established the _Trading Company of the\nKyrgyz Republic_ to monitor trade flows involving Kyrgyz companies whose goods\ndo not physically enter the country. This strategic move is part of\nKyrgyzstan’s broader efforts to regulate trade flows and financial\ntransactions, especially in the context of increased scrutiny over re-export\nactivities and compliance with international sanctions."

    "text": "Kyrgyzstan demonstrated strong macroeconomic performance between 2022 and\n2024. The country maintained a fiscal surplus for two consecutive years, in\n2023 and 2024, reflecting prudent public financial management and stronger-\nthan-expected revenue collection. Higher budget revenues were driven by taxes\nand customs duties, which increased due to rising imports, higher gold prices,\nand improved tax administration. Government expenditures rose to 34% of GDP in\n2024 (up from 33% in 2023), fueled by increased spending on healthcare,\nsalaries, and pensions.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Kyrgyzstan reported a significant fiscal surplus\nof $528 million, driven by a 84% year-over-year increase in budget revenues.\nThe surplus is expected to contribute to reducing public debt and financing\ninfrastructure projects.\n\nIn recent years, Kyrgyz economy has been affected by inflationary pressures\nstemming from global supply chain disruptions triggered by the Russia-Ukraine\nwar. Nevertheless, inflation remained relatively contained, supported by a\nstable som and prudent monetary policy from the National Bank of the Kyrgyz\nRepublic. It declined from 10.8% in 2023 to 5% in 2024, before edging up to\n6.9% by February 2025. The National Bank has maintained the policy rate at 9%\nsince May 2024.\n\nBanking sector capital adequacy and liquidity ratios remained strong at 22.3%\nand 78.8%, well above requirements.\n\nThe currency strengthened by 2.3% against the US dollar in 2024, while the\nreal effective exchange rate appreciated by 3.6%. Purchases of domestically\nmined gold and the conversion of nonmonetary gold on the National Bank's\nbalance sheet to reserves increased gross reserves by a substantial 57.2% to\n$5.1 billion at the end of 2024, cover for 4.2 months of projected imports, up\nfrom 2.4 months in 2023."

    "text": "Kyrgyzstan’s total public debt stood at $6.6 billion as of 31 December 2024,\nrepresenting 37.6% of GDP for the year, down from 42% in 2023. Total external\npublic debt amounted to $4.5 billion, or 25% of GDP, funded primarily by\nofficial bilateral and multilateral creditors at concessional rates and with\nlong maturities. This significantly limits the potential for nonresident\ncapital flight in an adverse scenario, thereby mitigating external\nvulnerabilities.\n\nKyrgyzstan's largest external creditors are Export–Import Bank of China ($1.65\nbillion or 36% of gross external debt), Asian Development Bank (16%), World\nBank (16%), the IMF (8%), the Eurasian Development Bank (6%). The average\nweighted interest rate on external public debt was 1.57% per annum."

    "text": "Irrigated fields in the Chuy Valley\n\nAgriculture remains a vital part of Kyrgyzstan's economy and a refuge for\nworkers displaced from industry. Subsistence farming has increased in the\nearly 2000s. After sharp reductions in the early 1990s, by the early 2000s\nagricultural production was approaching 1991 levels. Grain production in the\nlower valleys and livestock grazing on upland pastures occupy the largest\nshare of the agricultural workforce. Farmers are shifting to grain and away\nfrom cotton and tobacco. Other important products are dairy products, hay,\nanimal feed, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar beets.\n\nKyrgyzstan is now largely food self-sufficient, especially in dairy (110%),\nvegetables (96%), potatoes (94%), and meat (80%). Grain production (especially\nwheat and maize) is increasing to reduce import dependency, though ~12% of\nwheat is still imported.\n\nKyrgyzstan's major agricultural crop production in 2024:\n\n* **Wheat** : 750,000 tons\n* **Barley** : 650,000 tons\n* **Maize (corn)** : 770,000 tons\n* **Rice** : 50,000 tons\n* **Potato** : 1,200,000 tons\n* **Sugar beet** : 870,000 tons\n* **Fruits and berries** : 426,000 tons\n* **Vegetables** : 1,500,000 tons"

    "text": "Only 4% of Kyrgyzstan is classified as forested. All of that area is state-\nowned, and none is classified as available for wood supply. The main\ncommercial product of the forests is walnuts.\n\nThe Arslanbob walnut forest is the largest natural walnut forest in the world,\nlocated in the Jalal-Abad Region of Kyrgyzstan, on the western slopes of the\nFergana and Chatkal mountain ranges. Covering approximately 11,000 hectares of\ndense walnut groves, the broader forest zone, which includes other tree\nspecies, extends over 600,000 to 700,000 hectares. Each mature tree can yield\n150 to 400 kilograms of walnuts annually. Kyrgyzstan is a **major regional\nexporter of walnuts** , with significant shipments to Russia, Iran, and\nTurkey. In some years, up to 25% of Russia’s walnut imports come from\nKyrgyzstan."

    "text": "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan’s industrial sector\nexperienced a sharp decline due to disrupted supply chains and the loss of\ntraditional Soviet markets. In 2005, industrial output (excluding gold\nproduction) accounted for only about 14% of the country’s GDP, reflecting the\nsector’s prolonged stagnation. However, since the early 2020s, the industrial\nsector has shown signs of recovery and structural transformation.\n\nBy 2023, industry — including manufacturing, energy, and mining — contributed\napproximately 22.6% of GDP. Industrial production grew by 5.6% in 2024, with\nstrong momentum continuing into 2025. This revival has been driven by renewed\ninvestment in mining, energy, and light manufacturing, along with state-\nsupported programs such as the _100 Industrial Enterprises_ initiative.\n\nGrowth has been particularly strong in mining (especially gold and coal),\nelectricity generation, small-scale hydropower, and light industries like\ntextiles and food processing. Automotive assembly and domestic production of\nconstruction materials are also emerging as growth areas.\n\nHousing construction has also seen significant expansion, driven by population\ngrowth, urbanization, and remittance-fueled demand. In 2024, the construction\nsector grew by over 18%, with residential development leading the trend,\nespecially in Bishkek, Chuy, Osh and Jalal Abad provinces. Rising domestic\nproduction of construction materials and increased private investment have\ncontributed to this boom, turning housing construction into one of the key\nengines of non-extractive economic activity."

    "text": "Over 90% of Kyrgyzstan's electricity generation relies on hydropower,\nprimarily from large cascade plants on the Naryn River. However, the country\nhas historically exploited less than 15% of its estimated hydroelectric\npotential of approximately 140 TWh annually. As of 2024, hydropower accounted\nfor around 90% of all electricity production, with small hydroelectric plants\ncontributing approximately 400 GWh alongside 12.8 billion kWh from large hydro\nfacilities.\n\nKyrgyzstan has limited domestic fossil fuel reserves and heavily depends on\nnatural gas imports from Uzbekistan. Thermal (coal- and gas-fired) plants\nsupplied 1.8 billion kWh in 2024, while hydropower produced 12.77 billion kWh;\nthe country imported 3.6 billion kWh to meet rising demand of 18.3 billion\nkWh.\n\nEnergy losses remain high: in peak seasons, up to 45% of electricity may be\nlost or diverted illegally. Per capita consumption remains elevated relative\nto income levels, and while demand is high, a comprehensive national strategy\nfor demand reduction is not yet in place.\n\nThe country's infrastructure is aging: the national grid includes over 45,000\nkm of transmission lines, largely built during Soviet-era expansion, along\nwith approximately 3 GW of installed generation capacity, 80% of which is\nhydropower.\n\nKyrgyzstan is actively expanding both large and small hydropower projects. The\nproposed **Kambar-Ata-1** project — a 1,860 MW dam on the Naryn River— has\nreceived roadmap support from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan and\nsecured at least US $18.6 million in World Bank development funding by\nmid-2024. When operational (expected by 2028), it is projected to generate 5.6\nbillion kWh annually, enabling year-round domestic supply, seasonal export\ncapacity, and support for the CASA-1000 transmission corridor.\n\nSmall hydropower capacity is also scaling up: private plants are expected to\nreach 400–500 MW by 2027–2028, adding roughly 600 million kWh annually. The\ncountry is also beginning to diversify its energy mix with solar and wind: a\n200 MW solar plant near Tokmok is expected by 2025, and additional solar (400\nMW) and wind (100 MW) projects are in development as of 2024.\n\nHydropower remains the backbone of Kyrgyzstan's energy sector, with ongoing\ndiversification and modernization efforts aimed at reducing energy losses,\nenhancing self-sufficiency, and boosting exports to neighboring countries."

From attracting around 450,000 tourists annually in the early 2000s,\nthe country welcomed over 8.6 million visitors in 2024. This rapid growth has\nboosted tourism service exports to nearly $480 million in the first half of\n2024 alone. Visitors primarily come from neighboring Central Asian countries\nlike Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia, but there is a growing number of\ntourists from China, South Korea, Türkiye, and Europe. Despite earlier\nchallenges related to limited investment, the sector is benefiting from\nimproved infrastructure, easier visa regulations, and targeted government\npromotion.\n\nThe financial sector in Kyrgyzstan plays a critical role in supporting\neconomic diversification. Banks and microfinance institutions provide much-\nneeded credit and financial services to small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs) and rural entrepreneurs. Microfinance, in particular, has expanded\nrapidly, increasing financial inclusion and empowering grassroots economic\nactivity."

According to the L2KGZ survey, 50% of\nrespondents identified jobs as the top economic challenge, while real\nhousehold incomes stagnated in the latter half of 2024.\n\nUnited Nations World Food Programme (WFP) reports that approximately 30% of\nKyrgyzstan’s population lives in poverty, with an additional 10% at risk of\nfalling below the poverty line. The WFP highlights vulnerability to both\ninternal and external shocks, including high dependence on food imports,\nreduced remittances due to changing labor migration policies; particularly in\nRussia; and climate-related challenges such as drought and glacier melt. Food\nprices remain around 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels, leaving 36% of the\npopulation unable to afford a nutritious diet, while 72% of households resort\nto coping mechanisms to cover basic needs."
