    "text": "The **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute\nand per capita terms. As of 2023, Kazakhstan attracted more than US$370\nbillion of foreign investments since becoming an independent republic after\nthe dissolution of the former Soviet Union.\n\nIt possesses oil reserves as well as minerals and metals. Almost every known\nelement on the periodic table can be found in Kazakhstan. It also has\nconsiderable agricultural potential, with its vast steppe lands accommodating\nboth livestock and grain production. The mountains in the south are important\nfor apples and walnuts; both species grow wild there. Kazakhstan's industrial\nsector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of demand for\nKazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp\ndecline of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring\nin 1994. In 1995–97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and\nprivatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into\nthe private sector. Kazakhstan was granted \"market economy country\" status by\nthe European Union and the United States, in 2000 and 2002 respectively.\n\nThe December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to\nbuild a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field through Russia to\nthe Black Sea increased prospects for substantially larger oil exports until\nPutin took issue with the lukewarm support he experienced in the wake of the\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.\nKazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth\ndue to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A bright\nspot in 1999 was the recovery of international petroleum prices, which,\ncombined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest,\npulled the economy out of recession.\n\nGDP per capita shrank by 26% in the 1990s. In the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy\ngrew sharply, aided by increased prices on world markets for Kazakhstan's\nleading exports: oil, metals and grain. GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in\n1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by\n10.6%. Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as\nneighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to\npropel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in\ngovernment finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP\nin 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in\neconomic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of\nthe Russo-Ukrainian War. The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014\nand by 22% in 2015.\n\nIn 2023, the International Institute for Management Development compiled its\nWorld Competitiveness Ranking, ranking Kazakhstan 37th out of 64 countries.\nThe ranking analyzes and ranks countries according to how they manage their\ncompetencies to achieve long-term value creation.\n\nCyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia,\nvisited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during\nthe 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about\nKazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report\n2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide. After 2000,\nthe government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New\nPublic Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and\nincreasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.\n\nKazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional\nranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World\nIntellectual Property Organization.\n\nThe main producer of cotton pulp in Kazakhstan is Khlopkoprom. Judging by a\nnumber of transactions, its products have been supplied to gunpowder\nmanufacturers in the Russian Federation since 2022. Most of the factories that\nimported pulp from Kazakhstan for the manufacture of explosives are under US\nand Ukrainian sanctions. According to OCCRP, Vlast, and iStories, a\nsignificant increase in Kazakhstan's exports of cotton pulp and derivatives to\nthe Russian Federation after February 24, 2022, was identified. Exported\ncomponents are key in the manufacture of explosives and gunpowder. There are\ncontracts for the supply of raw materials to the Kazan Gunpowder Plant from\nKazakhstan until 2026, and to the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant (which also\nproduces gunpowder) until 2024."

Kazakhstan's economic freedom score is 69.1, equalling\n\"moderately free\". Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, with\nsignificant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity\noffsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom. Kazakhstan is\nranked 11th among 43 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall\nscore is above the regional and world averages.\n\nAccording to the World Bank’s latest Kazakhstan economic update – Economic\nRecovery During Challenging Times (spring, 2023), the economy is set to\nexperience a moderate growth acceleration, with real GDP forecast to rise by\n3.5 percent in 2023 and 4 percent in 2024 supported largely by the\nhydrocarbons sector as oil production increases. In the 2023 Economic Freedom\nIndex published by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., Kazakhstan\nranks 71st out of 176 countries, falling in the group of \"moderately free\"\ncountries.

    "text": "According to the World Bank, Kazakhstan's economy grew by 5.1% in H1 2023,\ndriven by exports and fiscal stimulus. GDP is projected to grow by 4.5% in\n2023 and subsequent years, aided by new oil production coming on-stream.\n\nKazakhstan's economy recorded an average real GDP growth rate of 3.0% in the\ndecade to 2022, above the 2.5% average for Eastern Europe. In 2022, real GDP\ngrowth was 3.3%. The official estimate for Kazakhstan's GDP was $512 billion\nat the end of 2022 in purchasing power parity terms.\n\nThe country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014. The country\nexperienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil\nprices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with\nIBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will\nallocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy\nand reaching the sustainable development.\n\nThe World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of\nan upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170 billion.\n\nAnother 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.\n\nForeign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's\nagricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products\nsector.\n\nIn 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low\noil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National\nEconomy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%.\nSectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction\n(6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).\n\nThe GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between\n2013 and 2017.\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing\nBusiness 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28\nto 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed\nKazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th\nplace), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy,\nwhich accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.\n\nThe biggest growth in 2020 occurred in the automotive industry (+53.6%),\npharmaceuticals (+39.7%), processed metal products (+19.5%), mechanical\nengineering (+16.5%), as well as in light industry (+16.4%). The industries in\nthe service sector that demonstrated growth included construction (+10.7%) and\ninformation and communications (+8.2%).\n\nThe World Bank reported that Kazakhstan's economy recorded a gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) growth of 3.2% in 2022. This was a part of the trend where the\neconomy was projected to grow by 3.9% in 2023, driven mainly by the\nhydrocarbons sector and increased oil production."

It exported 28,883,000 tons of oil in 2000, up 38.8%\nfrom 20,813,000 tons in 1999. Production in 2001 has been growing at roughly\n20%, on target to meet the government's forecast of 40,100,000 tons of oil\n(800,000 barrels per day). In 2000, production reached 11.5 km3 of natural\ngas, up from 8.2 km3 in 1999.\n\nKazakhstan has the potential to be a world-class oil exporter in the medium\nterm. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakhstan is the TengizChevroil\njoint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by\nKazMunaiGas of Kazakhstan, and 5% by LukArco of Russia. The Karachaganak\nnatural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip,\nChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. The Agip-led Offshore Kazakhstan Consortium has\ndiscovered potentially huge Kashagan oil field in the northern Caspian.\nKazakhstan's economic future is linked to oil and gas development. GDP growth\nwill depend on the price of oil, as well as the ability to develop new\ndeposits.\n\nJanuary 2022 began with thousands of people returning to the streets of\nKazakhstan to protest against the surging gas prices, recording four straight\ndays of demonstrations, which is claimed to be the biggest protests to have\ntaken place in the oil-rich country in decades. Protesters invaded into\ngovernment buildings and took over police vehicles despite a strict emergency\nled by the state being in place."

Unfortunately, the industry experienced a\ndecline despite high hopes, with sales dwindling to only 47,000 in 2016.\n\nIn 2020, the Kazakh economy observed the biggest growth in its automotive\nindustry, which saw a 53.6% growth, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ongoing state support for the domestic auto industry, primarily through\nrecycling fees, is a contentious issue. For 20 years, the industry has largely\noperated as a mere assembly hub, importing spare parts from abroad and\nperforming basic assembly tasks, such as fitting wheels—hardly advancing\ntowards establishing a truly Kazakh brand in the automotive sector. This\nsituation has fostered public dissent, notably from groups like #Нетутильсбору\n[no recycling fee], who argue that such policies unfairly prioritize industry\nsupport over the needs of regular citizens. This has contributed to an\nincrease in the average age of vehicles across Kazakhstan, as newer,\naffordable options remain inaccessible for many. The group's primary demands\ninclude the abolition of these recycling fees and a redirection of support\ntowards more pressing public needs, challenging the continued governmental\nsupport that, they argue, effectively \"mummifies\" an unproductive industry."

Among the key points were\nindustrialization, diversification, a move toward green energy, simplification\nof tax codes, and a focus on transparency and fairness in governance.\n\nParticular focus will be given to sectors like heavy engineering, uranium\nenrichment, and automotive components, he noted. Tokayev proposed that in\norder to support the manufacturing industry, foreign and domestic investors\nshould be exempted from paying taxes and other mandatory payments for the\nfirst three years.\n\nOn fiscal matters, the President called for a coordination of financial and\nmonetary policies, with the aim of achieving stable economic growth of 6-7\npercent. He also emphasized the need to attract foreign banks to boost\ncompetition and solve the problem of insufficient corporate lending.\n\nTokayev further accentuated the need to support small and medium enterprises\nand accelerate privatization. Changes in legislation will be initiated to\nencourage consolidation among small businesses, and efforts will be\nintensified to demonopolize key markets.\n\nIn his address, the President also focused on Kazakhstan’s commitment to\nsustainability and environmental protection. Tokayev highlighted plans to\nincrease renewable energy capacity and develop hydrogen generation. The\nPresident proposed to hold a national referendum on the construction of a\nnuclear power plant.\n\nThe Kazakh leader also indicated a vision for Kazakhstan to become an IT-\nfocused country. He directed the government to increase the export of IT\nservices to one billion dollars by 2026. This will be facilitated by\npartnerships with major foreign IT companies.\n\nIn the realm of transportation, President Tokayev outlined plans to establish\nKazakhstan as a major transit hub in Eurasia, focusing on key routes like the\nTrans-Caspian and the international North-South Corridor. He noted that\nKazakhstan should eventually become a full-fledged transport and logistics\npower.

    "text": "Kazakhstan is the largest recipient of total and annual foreign direct\ninvestment of all CIS countries. The OECD has recognized the strides the\ngovernment has made in opening the country to international investment and in\nimproving the policy framework for investment as part of their efforts to\ndiversify the economy. In 2017 Kazakhstan was invited by OECD to become\nAdherent to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational\nEnterprises.\n\nAs of 30 September 2014, total foreign investment in Kazakhstan reached\nUS$211.5 billion. Of that total, net foreign Direct Investment constituted\nUS$129.3 billion, with portfolio and other investments comprising the\nremaining US$82.2 billion.\n\nThe FDI growth in Kazakhstan was largely driven by increased investment in\nmining, transport, financial services, telecommunication, and energy that\ncompensated for decreasing investment inflows in construction, metallurgy, and\ntrade. The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov, has stated that\nKazakhstan aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDIs) worth around US$25\nbillion in 2023, adding that 46 projects involving international financial\ninvestments were implemented in the country during 2022 in renewable energy,\nmetallurgy, agriculture, mining industry, and engineering. Kazakhstan's top-10\nFDI donors in 2022 included the Netherlands, the Unitesd States, Switzerland,\nBelgium, Russia, South Korea, China, France, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.\n\nKazakhstan established the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC),\nmodelled on the Dubai International Financial Center, in 2018. The AIFC offers\nforeign investors an alternative jurisdiction for operations, with tax\nholidays, flexible labor rules, a Common Law-based legal system, and\nflexibility to carry out transactions in any currency. The Kazakh government\nrecommends that foreign investors use the AIFC for contracts with Kazakh\nbusinesses.\n\nOver the past five years, the major foreign investors in Kazakhstan have been\nthe Netherlands ($33.8 billion of investment), the United States ($19.4\nbillion), Switzerland ($12.5 billion), China ($ 6.2 billion) and France ($ 4.7\nbillion). Notably, almost 60% of the investment projects are related to non-\nextractive sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, trade, as well as\nfinancial and insurance services. Agriculture is one of Kazakhstan's most\nimportant sectors where the country seeks to attract foreign investments to\nboost the competitiveness of this sector of economy. To that end, in 2017\nKazAgro negotiated with the European Investment Bank (EIB) a €200 million loan\nfor a period of 15 years.\n\n13 Kazakhstan's regions out of 14 saw investment growth in 2020, despite the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. High growth of investment was in the construction sector,\nspecifically in Turkestan region and Zhambyl region as well as Shymkent city.\nThe gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in Kazakhstan reached $28\nbillion in 2022, a record-high in the past ten years. FDI inflow went up by\n17.7 percent since 2021 when it reached $23.8 billion. In 2012, this figure\nstood at $28.9 billion. The Atyrau Region received most of the investment –\n$8.3 billion (a 48.3 percent increase), followed by Almaty city with $7.6\nbillion (10.9 percent), Astana – $2.2 billion (107.2 percent), the East\nKazakhstan Region – $2.2 billion (3.1 percent), and the Aktobe Region – $1.2\nbillion (11.2 percent down).\n\nOne of the main areas for investment is renewable energy, as Kazakhstan has\none of the largest solar and wind potentials in the region. Moreover, it has\nabundant reserves, amounting to 90% of Central Asia's total, of critical raw\nmaterials, which are essential for the deployment of technologies like wind\nturbines (with rare earth magnets), batteries (lithium and cobalt) and\nsemiconductors (polysilicon). In November 2022, the EU had already recognised\nKazakhstan's value for the green transition by signing a strategic partnership\nfor the supply of critical raw materials, as well as green hydrogen."
