After the\nwar, the central government regained its ability to control key port and\ngovernment facilities. As a result, GDP per capita expanded 353% in the 1990s.\nEconomic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and\nresilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances,\nbanking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the\nmain sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains\nsince the launch of \"Horizon 2000,\" the government's $20 billion\nreconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before\nIsrael's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity.\nReal GDP grew at an average annual rate of less than 3% per year for 1997 and\n1998 and only 1% in 1999. During 1992–98, annual inflation fell from more than\n100% to 5%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $6 billion from\n$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign payments\nsurpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable. Progress\nalso has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial\ninfrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of\nBeirut's central business district; the stock market reopened in January 1996,\nand international banks and insurance companies are returning. The government\nnonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund\nreconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting borrowing.\nReducing the government budget deficit is a major goal of the current\ngovernment. The gap between rich and poor grew in the 1990s, resulting in\npopular dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's\nbenefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding\ninfrastructure to improving living conditions.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability,\nBeirut's reconstruction was almost complete, and increasing numbers of\ntourists poured into the nation's resorts. The economy witnessed growth, with\nbank assets reaching over US$75 billion, Market capitalization was also at an\nall-time high, estimated at $10.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of\n2006. The month-long 2006 war severely damaged Lebanon's economy, especially\nthe tourism sector. Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure\nmainly in the real estate and tourism sectors, resulting in a comparatively\nrobust post war economy. Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon\ninclude Saudi Arabia (with US$1.5 billion pledged), the European Union (with\nabout $1 billion) and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of\nup to $800 million.\n\nGiven the frequent security turmoil it has faced, the Lebanese banking system\nhas adopted a conservative approach, with strict regulations imposed by the\ncentral bank to protect the economy from political instability. These\nregulations have generally left Lebanese banks unscathed by the 2008 financial\ncrisis. Lebanese banks remain, under the current circumstances, high on\nliquidity and reputed for their security. In late 2008, Moody's shifted\nLebanon's sovereign rankings from stable to positive, acknowledging its\nfinancial security. Moreover, with an increase of 51% in the Beirut stock\nmarket, the index provider MSCI ranked Lebanon the world's best performer in\n2008. Lebanon is one of the only seven countries in the world in which the\nvalue of the stock market increased in 2008. The Lebanese economy experienced\ncontinued resilience, growing 8.5 percent in 2008, 7 percent in 2009 and 8.8%\nin 2010. However, Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio remained one of the highest in\nthe world.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has significantly affected Lebanese economic and financial\nsituation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living\nin Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct\nconsequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A\nloss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also\nbeen registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate\nincreased with 170,000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the\nperiod between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and\nlosses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian\nrefugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every\nyear.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund issued a second report on Lebanon in October\n2015, where its expectations of the economic growth rate were lowered to 2%,\ncompared to the 2.5% growth rate of the first report, released in April 2015.\n\nIn October 2019, Lebanon witnessed nationwide protests that erupted over the\ncountry's deteriorating economic conditions. Thousands of demonstrations took\nto the streets of downtown Beirut, calling for the government of Prime\nMinister Saad al-Hariri to quit over \"its utter failure to stop the\ndeterioration of the economic and living conditions in the country\". The\nprotests began after the government announced to charge 20 cents per day for\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) over social media apps, including\nWhatsApp, Facebook, and other applications.\n\nLebanon has a very high level of public debt and large external financing\nneeds. The 2010 public debt exceeded 150.7% of GDP, ranking fourth highest in\nthe world as a percentage of GDP, though down from 154.8% in 2009. At the end\n2008, finance minister Mohamad Chatah stated that the debt was going to reach\n$47 billion in that year and would increase to $49 billion if privatization of\ntwo telecoms companies did not occur. The Daily Star wrote that exorbitant\ndebt levels have \"slowed down the economy and reduced the government's\nspending on essential development projects\".\n\nDuring the early part of 2020, the central bank (BdL) defaulted on $90\nsovereign debt obligations and the government needed recourse to the IMF for a\nshortfall of $50 billion.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the explosion of 2,750 tons ammonium nitrate in a Beirut\nport warehouse caused the destruction of the \"only large grain silo\" in the\ncountry, in addition to more than 200 people killed and several square\nkilometres of pulverised buildings in the downtown core of the city. By 9\nAugust, President of France Emmanuel Macron had counted over €250 million of\nglobal contributions to the relief effort. On 10 August, the government of\nHassan Diab resigned. The day before, IMF director Kristalina Georgieva had\nlaid down four conditions for the co-operation of her organization:\n\n* restoring the financial solvency of the state,\n* cutting losses at state-owned companies,\n* passing a law to regulate capital outflows and\n* setting up a social safety net.\n\nOn 14 August, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs (UNOCHA) launched a $565 million appeal for donors of aid to victims\nof the explosions. The UN effort was to focus on: meals, first aid, shelters,\nand repair of schools. Some of the money that Macron collected would be used\nby the UNOCHA.",

    "text": "According to a World Bank report, Lebanon's economy which was structurally\nstrained before the Syrian shock suffered a real blow as an aftermath of the\nSyrian crisis which brought around 1.5 million Syrian refugees into Lebanon.\nThe GDP growth rate declined by around 1 percent in 2018. In August 2019, the\nUSD parallel exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate;\nthe official exchange rate for the USD had been £L1,507.5 since 1997, while\nthe parallel exchange rate was £L1,600 in the fall of 2019 and would increase\nto around £L4,200 in May 2020. The USD parallel exchange rate is increasing\nbecause of the dollar shortage in Lebanon. In a bid to lower the dollar price,\nthe central bank made an agreement with the licensed exchangers to make the\nofficial rates on offer at £L3,860/3,910. However, despite the central bank's\nefforts, on 23 June 2020, the black market dollar reached a staggering rate of\n£L 6,075 devaluing the Lebanese pound by 75%. This dollar shortage also caused\n785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020\nand caused 25,000 employees to lose their jobs. This economic crisis made\nLebanon's gross domestic product fall to about $44 billion, which was about\n$55 billion the year before. The crisis became worse when the COVID-19\npandemic affected the Lebanese economy. In 2020, the country defaulted for the\nfirst time on $30 billion in bonds and tried to seek help from the IMF but the\nnegotiations never reached fruition.\n\nThe liquidity crisis also lead to a restriction on the withdrawals from US\ndollar bank accounts. Depositors needed to preserve the value of their\nsavings, especially following press reports about possible haircuts and\nrestructuring of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real\nestate. For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate\ndeveloper, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5\nmillion. Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company,\nwhich lead to a rise of 500% in its price between the start of the liquidity\ncrisis and April 2021.\n\nThe already battered economy of Lebanon suffered fresh blow with the port\nblast on 4 August 2020. Economists have claimed that the blasts could result\nin the contraction of Beirut's GDP by around 20–25% for the year. The current\nfigure surpasses IMF's last forecast of 12% crash in GDP because of the\nongoing and increasing economic and political crisis in Lebanon.\n\nIn March 2021, Lebanon approved an emergency assistance package from the World\nBank worth $246 million in order to support struggling families and strengthen\nthe social safety and try to face the economic crisis.\n\nOn March 16, as the Lebanese pound jumped on the black market from £L13,000 to\n£L15,000 against the US dollar, protesters took to the streets, grocery stores\nclosed and bakeries threatened to close.\n\nAfter the meeting of the President Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Saad\nHariri on March 18, the Lebanese pound dropped from £L15,000 against the\ndollar on the black market to £L12,500.\n\nAs of 2023, Lebanon is considered by some to have become a failed state,\nsuffering from chronic poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.\nLebanon’s poverty rate have surged from 20 percent to over 80 percent after\n2019, driven by economic crises worsened by the 2020 Beirut explosion and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These crises have intensified resource shortages and\ndeepened reliance on sectarian patronage systems that have further entrenched\nsocietal divisions and accompanying political and economic stagnation.",

In late 2000, the\ngovernment substantially reduced customs duties, adopted export promotion\nschemes for agriculture, decreased social security fees and restrictions on\ninvestment in real estate by foreigners, and adopted an open-skies policy,\nwith positive effects on trade in 1991. Nonetheless, the relative appreciation\nof the Lebanese currency has undermined competitiveness, with merchandise\nexports falling from 23% of GDP in 1989 to 4% in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, the government turned its focus to fiscal measures, Increasing\ngasoline taxes, reducing expenditures, and approving a value-added-tax that\nbecame effective in February 2002. Slow money growth and dollarization of\ndeposits have hampered the ability of commercial banks to finance the\ngovernment, leaving more of the burden to the central bank. This monetization\nof the fiscal deficit has put enormous pressure on central bank reserves,\nmitigated only slightly with the issuance of new Eurobonds over the past 2\nyears. The central bank has maintained a stable currency by intervening\ndirectly in the market, as well as low inflation, and succeeded in maintaining\ninvestors' confidence in debt. It has done so at a cost, however, as\ninternational reserves declined by $2.4 billion in 2000 and by $1.6 billion in\nthe first half of 2001.\n\nFor 2002, the government has put primary emphasis on privatization, initially\nin the telecom sector and electricity, with continued planning for sales of\nthe state airline, Beirut port, and water utilities. The government has\npledged to apply the proceeds of sales to reducing the public debt and the\nbudget deficit. In addition, it projects that privatization will bring new\nsavings as government payrolls are pared, interest rates decline, and private\nsector growth and foreign investment are stimulated. The government also is\ntackling the daunting task of administrative reform, aiming to bring in\nqualified technocrats to address ambitious economic programs, and reviewing\nfurther savings that can be realized through reforms of the income tax system.\nThe Lebanese Government faces major challenges in order to meet the\nrequirements of a fiscal adjustment program focusing on tax reforms and\nmodernization, expenditure rationalization, privatization, and improved debt\nmanagement.\n\nFaraya in Mount Lebanon Governorate.

More than 160 offices\nrepresenting U.S. businesses currently operate in Lebanon. Since the lifting\nof the passport restriction in 1997 (see below), a number of large U.S.\ncompanies have opened branches or regional offices, including Microsoft,\nAmerican Airlines, Coca-Cola, FedEx, UPS, General Electric, Parsons\nBrinckerhoff, Cisco Systems, Eli Lilly, Computer Associates and Pepsi Cola.\nMexico has also many enterprises run by ethnic Lebanese, such as Carlos Slim's\nTelmex.\n\nSolidere shares are the most actively traded in the Beirut Stock Exchange.

Souaid emphasized the importance of\npreserving the central bank’s independence and safeguarding the rights of\nsmall depositors.\n\nWhile IMF officials welcomed the renewed seriousness of the Lebanese side,\nthey reiterated that progress would depend on effective\nimplementation—something that had hindered past negotiations due to political\ndivisions and legislative inaction. Further discussions were held with IMF\nMiddle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour. In addition, Lebanon sought\nsupport through a proposed $1 billion World Bank loan to assist in post-\nconflict reconstruction and the establishment of a national social safety net.\nAccording to the delegation, the reform proposals were internally driven and\nframed as essential for the country's economic recovery and long-term\nstability, rather than merely a response to external pressures."
