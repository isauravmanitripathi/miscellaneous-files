    "text": "Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has\nundergone a transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market\neconomy, a process which some observers were to believe was slowed in the\n1994–98 period due to the crony capitalism and other fiscal policies of Prime\nMinister Vladimír Mečiar's government. While economic growth and other\nfundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt\nand trade deficits also rose, and privatization was uneven. Real annual GDP\ngrowth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999.\n\nTwo governments of the \"liberal-conservative\" Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda\n(1998–2006) pursued policies of macroeconomic stabilization and market-\noriented structural reforms. Nearly the entire economy has now been\nprivatized, and foreign investment has picked up. Economic growth exceeded\nexpectations in the early 2000s, despite recession in key export markets. In\n2001 policies of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform led to\nspiraling unemployment. Unemployment peaked at 19.2% (Eurostat regional\nindicators) in 2001. Solid domestic demand boosted economic growth to 4.1% in\n2002. Strong export growth, in turn, pushed economic growth to a still-strong\n4.2% in 2003 and 5.4% in 2004, despite a downturn in household consumption.\nMultiple reasons entailed a GDP growth of 6% in 2005. Headline consumer price\ninflation dropped from 26% in 1993 to an average rate of 7.5% in 2004, though\nthis was boosted by hikes in subsidized utilities prices ahead of Slovakia's\naccession to the European Union. In July 2005, the inflation rate dropped to\n2.0% and is projected at less than 3% in 2005 and 2.5% in 2006. In 2006,\nSlovakia reached the highest economic growth (8.9%) among the members of OECD\nand the third highest in the EU (just behind Estonia and Latvia). The country\nhas had difficulties addressing regional imbalances in wealth and employment.\nGDP per capita ranges from 188% of EU average in Bratislava to only 54% in\nEastern Slovakia.\n\nAbout 10% of the Slovak labour force is expatriate in 2014. The country has\none of the highest levels of long-term unemployment in Europe, with 7.1% of\nthe labour force unemployed for more than a year in 2017.\n\n99.9% of Slovak firms are small and medium-sized enterprises and they account\nfor 73.3% of all jobs in the country."

    "text": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovakia has increased dramatically. Cheap\nand skilled labor, a 19% flat tax rate for both businesses and individuals, no\ndividend taxes, a weak labor code, and a favorable geographical location are\nSlovakia's main advantages for foreign investors. FDI inflow grew more than\n600% from 2000 and cumulatively reached an all-time high of, US$17.3 billion\nin 2006, or around $18,000 per capita by the end of 2006. The total inflow of\nFDI in 2006 was $2.54 billion. In October 2005 new investment stimuli\nintroduced – more favorable conditions to IT and research centers, especially\nto be located in the east part of the country (where there is more\nunemployment), to bring more added value and not to be logistically demanding.\n\nOrigin of foreign investment 1996–2005 – the Netherlands 24.3%; Germany 19.4%,\nAustria 14.1%; Italy 7.5%, United States (8th largest investor) 4.0%. Top\ninvestors by companies: Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Neusiedler (Austria), Gaz\nde France (France), Gazprom (Russia), U.S.Steel (U.S.), MOL (Hungary), ENEL\n(Italy), E.ON (Germany).\n\nForeign investment sectors – industry 38.4%; banking and insurance 22.2%;\nwholesale and retail trade 13.1%; production of electricity, gas and water\n10.5%; transport and telecommunications 9.2%.\n\nForeign direct investment _\"on green field\"_\n(US$millions)[_needs update_] | 2003 | 2004 | 2005\n---|---|---|---\nInflows | 756 | 1,261 | 1,908\nOutflows | 22 | 144 | 146\n\nFormer minister (1998-2002) Brigita Schmögnerová explains that: \"There is\nstill a consensus among leaders on social dumping. Since the enlargement of\nthe European Union, foreign companies have been looking for the cheapest\nlabour, but instead of joining forces, governments in the region compete to\noffer the lowest possible level of taxes. When Slovakia joined the European\nUnion in 2004, it became the first OECD country to introduce a full flat tax\nrate of 19% on both corporate profits and income or consumer goods. The lack\nof tax progressivity leads to a sharp increase in inequality. Spending on\nhealth, education or housing is below the EU average."
