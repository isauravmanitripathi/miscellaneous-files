    "text": "| This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( September 2024)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Mongolia** has traditionally been based on agriculture and\nlivestock. Mongolia also has extensive mineral deposits: copper, coal,\nmolybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial\nproduction. Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), disappeared almost overnight in 1990–91, in the time of the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union. Mongolia was driven into deep recession.\n\nEconomic growth picked up in 1997–99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of\nnatural disasters and increases in world prices of copper and cashmere. Public\nrevenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of\nthe 1997 Asian financial crisis. In August and September 1999, the economy\nsuffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products.\nMongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997. The international\ndonor community pledged over $300 million per year in the last Consultative\nGroup Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999. Recently, the Mongolian\neconomy has grown at a fast pace due to an increase in mining and Mongolia\nattained a GDP growth rate of 11.7% in 2013. However, because much of this\ngrowth is export-based, Mongolia is suffering from the global slowdown in\nmining caused by decreased growth in China."

    "text": "The rapid political changes of 1990–91 marked the beginning of Mongolia's\nefforts to develop a market economy, but these efforts have been complicated\nand disrupted by the dissolution and continuing deterioration of the economy\nof the former Soviet Union. Prior to 1991, 80% of Mongolia's trade was with\nthe former Soviet Union, and 15% was with other Council for Mutual Economic\nAssistance (CMEA) countries. Mongolia was heavily dependent upon the former\nSoviet Union for fuel, medicine, and spare parts for its factories and power\nplants.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe former Soviet Union served as the primary market for Mongolian industry.\nIn the 1980s, Mongolia's industrial sector became increasingly important. By\n1989, it accounted for an estimated 34% of material products, compared to 18%\nfrom agriculture. However, minerals, animals, and animal-derived products\nstill constitute a large proportion of the country's exports. Principal\nimports included machinery, petroleum, cloth, and building materials.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the government began to improve links with non-communist\nAsia and the West, and tourism in Mongolia developed. As of 1 January 1991,\nMongolia and the former Soviet Union agreed to conduct bilateral trade in hard\ncurrency at world prices.\n\nDespite its external trade difficulties, Mongolia has continued to press ahead\nwith reform. Privatization of small shops and enterprises has largely been\ncompleted in the 1990s, and most prices have been freed. Privatization of\nlarge state enterprises has begun. Tax reforms also have begun, and the barter\nand official exchange rates were unified in late 1991."

    "text": "Between 1990 and 1993, Mongolia suffered triple-digit inflation, rising\nunemployment, shortages of basic goods, and food rationing. During that\nperiod, economic output contracted by one-third. As market reforms and private\nenterprise took hold, economic growth began again in 1994–95. Unfortunately,\nsince this growth was fueled in part by over-allocation of bank credit,\nespecially to the remaining state-owned enterprises, economic growth was\naccompanied by a severe weakening of the banking sector. GDP grew by about 6%\nin 1995, thanks to largely to a boom in copper prices. Average real economic\ngrowth leveled off to about 3.5% in 1996–99 due to the 1997 Asian financial\ncrisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and worsening commodity prices,\nespecially copper and gold.\n\nMongolia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell from 3.2% in 1999 to 1.3%\nin 2000. The decline can be attributed to the loss of 2.4 million livestock in\nbad weather and natural disasters in 2000. Prospects for development outside\nthe traditional reliance on nomadic, livestock-based agriculture are\nconstrained by Mongolia's landlocked location and lack of basic\ninfrastructure. Since 1990, more than 1,500 foreign companies from 61\ncountries have invested[_when?_] a total of $338.3 million in Mongolia. By\n2003 private companies made up 70% of Mongolian GDP and 80% of exports.\n\nUntil recently, there have been a very few restrictions on foreign investments\nduring most of Mongolia's post-socialist period. Consequently, mining\nindustry's contribution to FDI increased to almost 25% in 1999 from zero in\n1990."

    "text": "Mongolian factory worker with cashmere Market in Mongolia\n\nMongolia's reliance on trade with China meant that the 2008 financial crisis\nhad a major effect, severely stunting the growth of its economy. With the\nsharp decrease in metal prices, especially copper (down 65% from July\n2008-February 2009), exports of its raw materials withered and by 2009 the\nstock market MSE Top-20 registered an all-time low since its dramatic spike in\nmid-2007. Just as the economy started to recover, Mongolia was hit by a Zud\nover the winter period of 2009–2010, causing many livestock to perish and thus\nseverely affecting cashmere production which accounts for a further 7% of the\ncountry's export revenues.\n\nAccording to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund estimates, real\nGDP growth reduced from 8% to 2.7% in 2009, and exports shrunk 26% from $2.5Bn\nto $1.9Bn before a promisingly steady increase up until 2008. Because of this,\nit was projected that between 20,000 and 40,000 fewer Mongolians (0.7% and\n1.4% of the population respectively) will be lifted out of poverty, than would\nhave been the case without the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn late 2009 and the beginning of 2010, however, the market has begun to\nrecover once again. Having identified and learnt from its previous economic\ninstabilities, legislative reform and a tightened fiscal policy promises to\nguide the country onwards and upwards. In February 2010, foreign assets were\nrecorded at USD1,569,449 million. New trade agreements are being formed and\nforeign investors are keeping a close eye on the \"Asian Wolf\".\n\nMining is the principal industrial activity in Mongolia, making up 30% of all\nMongolian industry. Another important industry is the production of cashmere.\nMongolia is the world's second largest producer of cashmere, with the main\ncompany, Gobi Cashmere, accounting for 21% of world cashmere production as of\n2006.\n\nTotal export in 2019 was US$7.6 billion.\n\nThe 2022 economic growth is expected to be one percent and international\ninstitutions anticipate the economy to speed up by at least six percent in\n2023 from expanded commodity exports. A significant commodity export boom is\nexpected starting from 2023 with new coal rail networks Error in Webarchive\ntemplate: Empty url. to China coming online and increased copper production\nfrom Rio Tinto’s underground mine Oyu Tolgoi in southern Mongolia.\n\nIn early 2020s, Mongolia's economy, though experiencing growth spurred by\nnatural resource exports, faces challenges. Over-reliance on mining, rising\ndebt, inflation, and potential fuel supply disruptions from Russia pose risks\nto the country's economic stability despite government efforts in\ninfrastructure and social programs."

    "section_name": "The Wolf Economy",
    "text": "The term was coined and subsequently popularized by Renaissance Capital in\ntheir report \"Mongolia: \"Blue-sky opportunity\". They state that Mongolia is\nset to become the new Asian tiger, or \"Mongolian wolf\" as they prefer to call\nit, and predict \"unstoppable\" economic growth. With the recent developments in\nthe mining industry and foreign interest increasing at an astonishing rate, it\nis claimed that the 'Wolf Economy' looks ready to pounce. The term's\naggressive title mirrors the country's attitude in the capital markets, and\nwith newfound mineral prospects it has the chance to retain its title as one\nof the world's fastest growing economies."

The burning of soft coal coupled with thousands of factories in\nUlaanbaatar and a sharp increase in individual motorization has resulted in\nsevere air pollution. Deforestation, overgrazed pastures, and, less recently,\nefforts to increase grain and hay production by plowing up more virgin land\nhave increased soil erosion from wind and rain."
