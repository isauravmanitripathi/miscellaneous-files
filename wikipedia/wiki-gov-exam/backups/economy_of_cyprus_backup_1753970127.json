    "text": "Cyprus has an open, free-market, service-based economy with some light\nmanufacturing. Internationally, Cyprus promotes its geographical location as a\n\"bridge\" between East and West, along with its educated English-speaking\npopulation, moderate local costs, good airline connections, and\ntelecommunications.\n\nSince gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, Cyprus has had a\nrecord of successful economic performance, reflected in strong growth, full\nemployment conditions and relative stability. The underdeveloped agrarian\neconomy inherited from colonial rule has been transformed into a modern\neconomy, with dynamic services, industrial and agricultural sectors and an\nadvanced physical and social infrastructure. The Cypriots are among the most\nprosperous people in the Mediterranean region, with GDP per capita in 2024\nsurpassing $38,000 in nominal terms and $62,000 on the basis of purchasing\npower parity.\n\nTheir standard of living is reflected in the country's \"very high\" Human\nDevelopment Index, by which it ranks 29th out of 191 countries in the world.\n\nHowever, after more than three decades of unbroken growth, the Cypriot economy\ncontracted in 2009. This reflected the exposure of Cyprus to the Great\nRecession and European debt crisis. Furthermore, Cyprus was dealt a severe\nblow by the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion in July 2011, with the\ncost to the economy estimated at €1–3 billion, or up to 17% of GDP.\n\nThe economic achievements of Cyprus during the preceding decades have been\nsignificant, bearing in mind the severe economic and social dislocation\ncreated by the Turkish invasion of 1974 and the continuing occupation of the\nnorthern part of the island by Turkey. The Turkish invasion inflicted a\nserious blow to the Cyprus economy and in particular to agriculture, tourism,\nmining and Quarrying: 70 percent of the island's wealth-producing resources\nwere lost, the tourist industry lost 65 percent of its hotels and tourist\naccommodation, the industrial sector lost 46 percent, and mining and quarrying\nlost 56 percent of production. The loss of the port of Famagusta, which\nhandled 83 percent of the general cargo, and the closure of Nicosia\nInternational Airport, in the buffer zone, were additional setbacks.\n\nThe success of Cyprus in the economic sphere has been attributed, _inter alia_\n, to the adoption of a market-oriented economic system, the pursuance of sound\nmacroeconomic policies by the government as well as the existence of a dynamic\nand flexible entrepreneurship and a highly educated labor force. Moreover, the\neconomy benefited from the close cooperation between the public and private\nsectors.\n\nIn the past 30 years, the economy has shifted from agriculture to light\nmanufacturing and services. The services sector, including tourism,\ncontributes almost 80% to GDP and employs more than 70% of the labor force.\nIndustry and construction account for approximately one-fifth of GDP and\nlabor, while agriculture is responsible for 2.1% of GDP and 8.5% of the labor\nforce. Potatoes and citrus are the principal export crops. After robust growth\nrates in the 1980s (average annual growth was 6.1%), economic performance in\nthe 1990s was mixed: real GDP growth was 9.7% in 1992, 1.7% in 1993, 6.0% in\n1994, 6.0% in 1995, 1.9% in 1996 and 2.3% in 1997. This pattern underlined the\neconomy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and\npolitical conditions in Cyprus, Western Europe, and the Middle East) and the\nneed to diversify the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and\nespecially in manufacturing are expected to act as a drag on growth until\nstructural changes are effected. Overvaluation of the Cypriot pound prior to\nthe adoption of the euro in 2008 had kept inflation in check.\n\nTrade is vital to the Cypriot economy — the island is not self-sufficient in\nfood and until the recent offshore gas discoveries had few known natural\nresources – and the trade deficit continues to grow. Cyprus must import fuels,\nmost raw materials, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment. More than\n50% of its trade is with the rest of the European Union, especially Greece and\nthe United Kingdom, while the Middle East receives 20% of exports. In 1991,\nCyprus introduced a value-added tax (VAT), which is at 19% as of 13 January\n2014. Cyprus ratified the new world trade agreement (General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade, GATT) in 1995 and began implementing it fully on 1 January\n1996. European Union accession negotiations started on 31 March 1998, and\nconcluded when Cyprus joined the European Union as a full member in 2004.",

    "text": "In 2012, Cyprus became affected by the Eurozone financial and banking crisis.\nIn June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need €1.8 billion of\nforeign aid to support the Cyprus Popular Bank, and this was followed by Fitch\ndown-grading Cyprus's credit rating to junk status. Fitch said Cyprus would\nneed an additional €4 billion to support its banks and the downgrade was\nmainly due to the exposure of Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic\nBank (Cyprus's 3 largest banks) to the Greek financial crisis.\n\nIn June 2012 the Cypriot finance minister, Vassos Shiarly, stated that the\nEuropean Central Bank, European Commission and IMF officials are to carry out\nan in-depth investigation into Cyprus' economy and banking sector to assess\nthe level of funding it requires. The Ministry of Finance rejected the\npossibility that Cyprus would be forced to undergo the sweeping austerity\nmeasures that have caused turbulence in Greece, but admitted that there would\nbe \"some negative repercussion\".\n\nIn November 2012 international lenders negotiating a bailout with the Cypriot\ngovernment have agreed on a key capital ratio for banks and a system for the\nsector's supervision. Both commercial banks and cooperatives will be overseen\nby the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance. They also set a core Tier 1\nratio – a measure of financial strength – of 9% by the end of 2013 for banks,\nwhich could then rise to 10% in 2014.\n\nIn 2014, Harris Georgiades pointed that exiting the Memorandum with the\nEuropean troika required a return to the markets. This he said, required\n\"timely, effective and full implementation of the program.\" The Finance\nMinister stressed the need to implement the Memorandum of understanding\nwithout an additional loan.\n\nIn 2015, Cyprus was praised by the President of the European Commission for\nadopting the austerity measures and not hesitating to follow a tough reform\nprogram.\n\nIn 2016, Moody's Investors Service changed its outlook on the Cypriot banking\nsystem to positive from stable, reflecting the view that the recovery will\nrestore banks to profitability and improve asset quality. The quick economic\nrecovery was driven by tourism, business services and increased consumer\nspending. Creditor confidence was also strengthened, allowing Bank of Cyprus\nto reduce its Emergency Liquidity Assistance to €2.0 billion (from €9.4\nbillion in 2013). Within the same period, Bank of Cyprus chairman Josef\nAckermann urged the European Union to pledge financial support for a permanent\nsolution to the Cyprus dispute."

    "section_name": "Economy of Northern Cyprus",
    "text": "The economy of Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus is about one-fifth the size of\nthe economy of the government-controlled area, while GDP per capita is around\nhalf. Because the _de facto_ administration is recognized only by Turkey, it\nhas had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have\nhesitated to invest there. The economy mainly revolves around the agricultural\nsector and government service, which together employ about half of the work\nforce.\n\nThe tourism sector also contributes substantially into the economy. Moreover,\nthe small economy has seen some downfalls because the Turkish lira is legal\ntender. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey has been known to\nprovide significant financial aid. In both parts of the island, water shortage\nis a growing problem, and several desalination plants are planned.\n\nThe economic disparity between the two communities is pronounced. Although the\neconomy operates on a free-market basis, the lack of private and government\ninvestment, shortages of skilled labor and experienced managers, and inflation\nand the devaluation of the Turkish lira continue to plague the economy."

    "text": "Turkey is by far the main trading partner of Northern Cyprus, supplying 55% of\nimports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the European Court\nof Justice (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of\nimporting produce from Northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and\nphytosanitary certificates granted by the _de facto_ authorities. The ECJ\ndecided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the\ninternationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member\nstates. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot\nexports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot\nexports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996.\nEven so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern\nCyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.\n\nThe most important exports of Northern Cyprus are citrus and dairy products.\nThese are followed by rakı, scrap and clothing.\n\nAssistance from Turkey is the mainstay of the Turkish Cypriot economy. Under\nthe latest economic protocol (signed 3 January 1997), Turkey has undertaken to\nprovide loans totalling $250 million for the purpose of implementing projects\nincluded in the protocol related to public finance, tourism, banking, and\nprivatization. Fluctuation in the Turkish lira, which suffered from\nhyperinflation every year until its replacement by the Turkish new lira in\n2005, exerted downward pressure on the Turkish Cypriot standard of living for\nmany years.\n\nThe _de facto_ authorities have instituted a free market in foreign exchange\nand permit residents to hold foreign-currency denominated bank accounts. This\nencourages transfers from Turkish Cypriots living abroad."

    "section_name": "Happiness",
    "text": "Economic factors such as the GDP and national income strongly correlate with\nthe happiness of a nation's citizens. In a study published in 2005, citizens\nfrom a sample of countries were asked to rate how happy or unhappy they were\nas a whole on a scale of 1 to 7 (Ranking: 1. Completely happy, 2. Very happy,\n3. Fairly happy,4. Neither happy nor unhappy, 5. Fairly unhappy, 6. Very\nunhappy, 7. Completely unhappy.) Cyprus had a score of 5.29. On the question\nof how satisfied citizens were with their main job, Cyprus scored 5.36 on a\nscale of 1 to 7 (Ranking: 1. Completely satisfied, 2. Very satisfied, 3.\nFairly satisfied, 4. Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5. Fairly\ndissatisfied, 6. Very dissatisfied, 7. Completely dissatisfied.) In another\nranking of happiness, Northern Cyprus ranks 58 and Cyprus ranks 61, according\nto the 2018 World Happiness Report. The report rates 156 countries based on\nvariables including income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom,\ntrust, and generosity.\n\nEconomic factors play a significant role in the general life satisfaction of\nCyprus citizens, especially with women who participate in the labor force at a\nlower rate, work in lower ranks, and work in more public and service sector\njobs than the men. Women of different skill-sets and \"differing economic\nobjectives and constraints\" participate in the tourism industry. Women\nparticipate in this industry through jobs like hotel work to serve and/or\nbring pride to their family, not necessarily to satisfy their own selves. In\nthis study, women with income higher than the mean household income reported\nhigher levels of satisfaction with their lives while those with lower income\nreported the opposite. When asked who they compare themselves with (those with\nlower, same, or higher economic status), results showed that those that\ncompared themselves with people of higher economic statuses than them had the\nlowest level of life satisfaction. While the correlation of income and\nhappiness is positive, it is significantly low; there is stronger correlation\nbetween comparison and happiness. This indicates that not only income level\nbut income level in relation to that of others affects their amount of life\nsatisfaction.\n\nClassified as a Mediterranean welfare regime, Cyprus has a weak public Welfare\nsystem. This means there is a strong reliance on the family, instead of the\nstate, for both familial and economic support. Another finding is that being a\nfull-time housewife has a stronger negative effect on happiness for women of\nNorthern Cyprus than being unemployed, showing how the combination of gender\nand the economic factor of participating in the labor force affects life\nsatisfaction. Economic factors also negatively correlate with the happiness\nlevels of those that live in the capital city: citizens living in the capital\nexpress lower levels of happiness. As found in this study, citizens of Cyprus\nthat live in its capital, Nicosia, are significantly less happy than others\nwhether or not socio-economic variables are controlled for. Another finding\nwas that the young people in the capital are unhappier than the rest of\nCyprus; the old are not."
