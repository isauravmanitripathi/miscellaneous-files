Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( March 2022)_  \n---|---  \n  \nIn ancient times, Maldives were renowned for cowries, coir rope, dried tuna\nfish (Maldive fish), ambergris (_maavaharu_) and coco de mer (_tavakkaashi_).\nLocal and foreign trading ships used to load these products in the Maldives\nand bring them abroad.\n\nNowadays, the mixed economy of Maldives is based on the principal activities\nof tourism, fishing and shipping. This results from the Maldives' strategic\ngeographic positioning near crucial sea routes essential for China's energy\nprovisions. Consequently, China has persistently utilized its economic\nresources to enhance its sway over the Maldivian government.\n\n**Tourism** is the largest industry in the Maldives, accounting for 28% of GDP\nand more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. It powered the\ncurrent GDP per capita to expand 265% in the 1980s and a further 115% in the\n1990s. Over 90% of government tax revenue flows in from import duties and\ntourism-related taxes.\n\n**Fishing** is the second leading sector in the Maldives. The economic reform\nprogram by the government in 1989 lifted import quotas and opened some exports\nto the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow\nmore foreign investment.\n\n**Agriculture** and manufacturing play a minor role in the economy,\nconstrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and shortage of\ndomestic labour. Most staple foods are imported.\n\n**Industry** in the Maldives consists mainly of garment production, boat\nbuilding, and handicrafts. It accounts for around 18% of GDP. Maldivian\nauthorities are concerned about the impact of erosion and possible global\nwarming in the low-lying country.\n\nAmong the 1,190 islands in the Maldives, only 198 are inhabited. The\npopulation is scattered throughout the country, and the greatest concentration\nis on the capital island, Malé. Limitations on potable water and arable land,\nplus the added difficulty of congestion are some of the problems faced by\nhouseholds in Malé.\n\nDevelopment of the infrastructure in the Maldives is mainly dependent on the\ntourism industry and its complementary tertiary sectors, transport,\ndistribution, real estate, construction, and government. Taxes on the tourist\nindustry have been plowed into infrastructure and it is used to improve\ntechnology in the agricultural sector.",
