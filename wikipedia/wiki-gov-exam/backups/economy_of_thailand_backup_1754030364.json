    "text": "The **economy of Thailand** is dependent on exports, which accounted for about\n58 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021. Thailand\nitself is a newly industrialized country, with a GDP of 17.922 trillion baht\n(US$514.8 billion) in 2023, the 9th largest economy in Asia. As of 2018,\nThailand has an average inflation of 1.06% and an account surplus of 7.5% of\nthe country's GDP. Its currency, the baht, is ranked as the tenth most\nfrequently used world payment currency in 2017.\n\nThe industrial and service sectors are the main sectors in the Thai gross\ndomestic product, with the former accounting for 39.2 percent of GDP.\nThailand's agricultural sector produces 8.4 percent of GDP—lower than the\ntrade and logistics and communication sectors, which account for 13.4 percent\nand 9.8 percent of GDP respectively. The construction and mining sector adds\n4.3 percent to the country's gross domestic product. Other service sectors\n(including the financial, education, and hotel and restaurant sectors) account\nfor 24.9 percent of the country's GDP. Telecommunications and trade in\nservices are emerging as centers of industrial expansion and economic\ncompetitiveness.\n\nThailand is the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, after Indonesia. Its\nper capita GDP 255,362 baht (US$7,336) in 2023 ranks fourth in Southeast Asian\nper capita GDP, after Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia. In July 2018, Thailand\nheld US$237.5 billion in international reserves, the second-largest in\nSoutheast Asia (after Singapore). Its surplus in the current account balance\nranks tenth of the world, made US$37.898 billion to the country in 2018.\nThailand ranks second in Southeast Asia in external trade volume, after\nSingapore.\n\nThe nation is recognized by the World Bank as \"one of the great development\nsuccess stories\" in social and development indicators. Despite a per capita\ngross national income (GNI) of US$7,090 and ranking 66th in the Human\nDevelopment Index (HDI), the percentage of people below the national poverty\nline decreased from 65.26 percent in 1988 to 8.61 percent in 2016, according\nto the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council's\n(NESDC) new poverty baseline.\n\nThailand is one of the countries with the lowest unemployment rates in the\nworld, reported as one percent for the first quarter of 2014. This is due to a\nlarge proportion of the population working in subsistence agriculture or on\nother vulnerable employment (own-account work and unpaid family work)."

    "text": "Thailand, formerly known as Siam, opened to foreign contact in the pre-\nindustrial era. Despite the scarcity of resources in Siam, coastal ports and\ncities and those at the river mouth were early economic centers which welcomed\nmerchants from Persia, the Arab countries, India, and China. The rise of\nAyutthaya during the 14th century was connected to renewed Chinese commercial\nactivity, and the kingdom became one of the most prosperous trade centers in\nAsia.\n\nWhen the capital of the kingdom moved to Bangkok during the 19th century,\nforeign trade (particularly with China) became the focus of the government.\nChinese merchants came to trade; some settled in the country and received\nofficial positions. A number of Chinese merchants and migrants became high\ndignitaries in the court.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century onward, European merchants were increasingly active.\nThe Bowring Treaty, signed in 1855, guaranteed the privileges of British\ntraders. The Harris Treaty of 1856, which updated the Roberts Treaty of 1833,\nextended the same guarantees to American traders.\n\nThe domestic market developed slowly, with serfdom a possible cause of\ndomestic stagnation. Most of the male population in Siam was in the service of\ncourt officials, while their wives and daughters may have traded on a small\nscale in local markets. Those who were heavily indebted might sell themselves\nas slaves. King Rama V abolished serfdom and slavery in 1901 and 1905,\nrespectively.\n\nFrom the early 20th century to the end of World War II, Siam's economy\ngradually became globalized. Major entrepreneurs were ethnic Chinese who\nbecame Siamese nationals. Exports of agricultural products (especially rice)\nwere very important and Thailand has been among the top rice exporters in the\nworld. The Siamese economy suffered greatly from the Great Depression, a cause\nof the Siamese revolution of 1932.\n\nSignificant investment in education in the 1930s (and again in the 1950s) laid\nthe basis for economic growth, as did a liberal approach to trade and\ninvestment."

    "text": "Postwar domestic and international politics played significant roles in Thai\neconomic development for most of the Cold War era. From 1945 to 1947 (when the\nCold War had not yet begun), the Thai economy suffered because of the Second\nWorld War. During the war, the Thai government (led by Field Marshal Luang\nPhibulsongkram) allied with Japan and declared war against the Allies. After\nthe war, Thailand had to supply 1.5 million tons of rice to Western countries\nwithout charge, a burden on the country's economic recovery. The government\ntried to solve the problem by establishing a rice office to oversee the rice\ntrade. During this period, a multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced amid\nfiscal problems, and the kingdom experienced a shortage of consumer goods.\n\nIn November 1947, a brief democratic period was ended by a military coup and\nthe Thai economy regained its momentum. In his dissertation, Somsak Nilnopkoon\nconsiders the period from 1947 to 1951 one of prosperity. By April 1948,\nPhibulsongkram, the wartime prime minister, returned to his previous office.\nHowever, he was caught in a power struggle between his subordinates. To\npreserve his power, Phibulsongkram began an anti-communist campaign to seek\nsupport from the United States. As a result, from 1950 onward, Thailand\nreceived military and economic aid from the US. The Phibulsongkram government\nestablished many state enterprises, which were seen as economic nationalism.\nThe state (and its bureaucrats) dominated capital allocation in the kingdom.\nAmmar Siamwalla, one of Thailand's most prominent economists, calls it the\nperiod of \"bureaucratic capitalism\"."

    "text": "In 1955, Thailand began to see a change in its economy fueled by domestic and\ninternational politics. The power struggle between the two main factions of\nthe Phibul regime—led by Police General Phao Sriyanond and General (later,\nField Marshal) Sarit Thanarat—increased, causing Sriyanonda to unsuccessfully\nseek support from the US for a coup against Phibulsongkram regime. Luang\nPhibulsongkram attempted to democratize his regime, seeking popular support by\ndeveloping the economy. He again turned to the US, asking for economic rather\nthan military aid. The US responded with unprecedented economic aid to the\nkingdom from 1955 to 1959. The Phibulsongkram government also made important\nchanges to the country's fiscal policies, including scrapping the multiple-\nexchange-rate system in favor of a fixed, unified system which was in use\nuntil 1984. The government also neutralized trade and conducted secret\ndiplomacy with the People's Republic of China, displeasing the United States.\n\nDespite his attempts to maintain power, Luang Phibulsongkram was deposed (with\nField Marshal Phin Choonhavan and Police General Phao Sriyanond) on 16\nSeptember 1957 in a coup led by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat. The Thanarat\nregime (in power from 1957 to 1973) maintained the course set by the\nPhibulsongkram regime with US support after severing all ties with the\nPeople's Republic of China and supporting US operations in Indochina. It\ndeveloped the country's infrastructure and privatized state enterprises\nunrelated to that infrastructure. During this period, a number of economic\ninstitutions were established, including the Bureau of Budget, the NESDC, and\nthe Thailand Board of Investment (BOI). The National Economic and Social\nDevelopment Plan was implemented in 1961. During this period, the market-\noriented Import-Substituting Industrialization (ISI) led to economic expansion\nin the kingdom during the 1960s. According to former President Richard M.\nNixon's 1967 _Foreign Affairs_ article, Thailand entered a period of rapid\ngrowth in 1958 (with an average growth rate of seven percent a year).\n\nFrom the 1970s to 1984, Thailand suffered from many economic problems:\ndecreasing US investment, budget deficits, oil-price spikes, and inflation.\nDomestic politics were also unstable. With the Vietnamese occupation of\nCambodia on 25 December 1978, Thailand became the front-line state in the\nstruggle against communism, surrounded by two communist countries and a\nsocialist Burma under General Ne Win. Successive governments tried to solve\nthe economic problems by promoting exports and tourism, still important for\nthe Thai economy.\n\nOne of the best-known measures to deal with the economic problems of that time\nwas implemented under General Prem Tinsulanonda's government, in power from\n1980 to 1988. Between 1981 and 1984, the government devalued the national\ncurrency, the Thai baht (THB), three times. On 12 May 1981, it was devalued by\n1.07 percent, from THB20.775/US$ to THB21/US$. On 15 July 1981, it was again\ndevalued, this time by 8.7 percent (from THB21/US$ to THB23/US$). The third\ndevaluation, on 5 November 1984, was the most significant: 15 percent, from\nTHB23/US$ to THB27/US$. The government also replaced the country's fixed\nexchange rate (where it was pegged to the US dollar) with a \"multiple currency\nbasket peg system\" in which the US dollar bore 80 percent of the weight.\nCalculated from the IMF's World Economic Outlook Database, in the period\n1980–1984, the Thai economy had an average GDP growth rate of 5.4 percent."

    "text": "Concurrent with the third devaluation of the Thai baht, on 22 September 1985,\nJapan, the US, the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany signed the Plaza\nAccord to depreciate the US dollar in relation to the yen and the Deutsche\nMark. Since the dollar accounted for 80 percent of the Thai currency basket,\nthe baht was depreciated further, making Thailand's exports more competitive\nand the country more attractive to foreign direct investment (FDI) (especially\nfrom Japan, whose currency had appreciated since 1985). In 1988, Prem\nTinsulanonda resigned and was succeeded by Chatichai Choonhavan, the first\ndemocratically elected prime minister of Thailand since 1976. The Cambodian-\nVietnamese War was ending; Vietnam gradually retreated from Cambodia by 1989,\nenhancing Thai economic development.\n\nAfter the 1984 baht devaluation and the 1985 Plaza Accord, although the public\nsector struggled due to fiscal constraints, the private sector grew. The\ncountry's improved foreign trade and an influx of foreign direct investment\n(mainly from Japan) triggered an economic boom from 1987 to 1996. Although\nThailand had previously promoted its exports, during this period the country\nshifted from import-substitution (ISI) to export-oriented industrialization\n(EOI). During this decade the Thai GDP (calculated from the IMF World Economic\nOutlook database) had an average growth rate of 9.5 percent per year, with a\npeak of 13.3 percent in 1988. In the same period, the volume of Thai exports\nof goods and services had an average growth rate of 14.8 percent, with a peak\nof 26.1 percent in 1988.\n\nEconomic problems persisted. From 1987 to 1996, Thailand experienced a current\naccount deficit averaging −5.4 percent of GDP per year, and the deficit\ncontinued to increase. In 1996, the current account deficit accounted for\n−7.887 percent of GDP (US$14.351 billion). A shortage of capital was another\nproblem. The first Chuan Leekpai government, in office from September 1992 to\nMay 1995, tried to solve this problem by granting Bangkok International\nBanking Facility (BIBF) licenses to Thai banks in 1993. This allowed BIBF\nbanks to benefit from Thailand's high-interest rate by borrowing from foreign\nfinancial institutions at low interest and loaning to Thai businesses. By\n1997, foreign debt had risen to US$109,276 billion (65% of which was short-\nterm debt), while Thailand had US$38,700 billion in international reserves.\nMany loans were backed by real estate, creating an economic bubble. By late\n1996, there was a loss of confidence in the country's financial institutions;\nthe government closed 18 trust companies and three commercial banks. The\nfollowing year, 56 financial institutions were closed by the government.\n\nAnother problem was foreign speculation. Aware of Thailand's economic problems\nand its currency basket exchange rate, foreign speculators (including hedge\nfunds) were certain that the government would again devalue the baht, under\npressure on both the spot and forward markets. In the spot market, to force\ndevaluation, speculators took out loans in baht and made loans in dollars. In\nthe forward market, speculators (believing that the baht would soon be\ndevalued) bet against the currency by contracting with dealers who would give\ndollars in return for an agreement to repay a specific amount of baht several\nmonths in the future.\n\nUSD / Thai Baht exchange rate\n\nIn the government, there was a call from Virapong Ramangkul (one of Prime\nMinister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's economic advisers) to devalue the baht, which\nwas supported by former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda. Yongchaiyudh ignored\nthem, relying on the Bank of Thailand (led by Governor Rerngchai Marakanond,\nwho spent as much as US$24,000 billion – about two-thirds of Thailand's\ninternational reserves) to protect the baht. On 2 July 1997, Thailand had\nUS$2,850 billion remaining in international reserves, and could no longer\nprotect the baht. That day Marakanond decided to float the baht, triggering\nthe 1997 Asian Financial Crisis."

    "text": "Countries affected by the 1997 Asian financial crisis\n\nThe Thai economy collapsed as a result of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\nWithin a few months, the value of the baht floated from THB25/US$ (its lowest\npoint) to THB56/US$. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) dropped from a peak\nof 1,753.73 in 1994 to a low of 207.31 in 1998. The country's GDP dropped from\nTHB3.115 trillion at the end of 1996 to THB2.749 trillion at the end of 1998.\nIn dollar terms, it took Thailand as long as 10 years to regain its 1996 GDP.\nThe unemployment rate went up nearly threefold: from 1.5 percent of the labor\nforce in 1996 to 4.4 percent in 1998.\n\nA sharp decrease in the value of the baht abruptly increased foreign debt,\nundermining financial institutions. Many were sold, in part, to foreign\ninvestors while others went bankrupt. Due to low international reserves from\nthe Bank of Thailand's currency-protection measures, the government had to\naccept a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Overall, Thailand\nreceived US$17.2 billion in aid.\n\nThe crisis impacted Thai politics. One direct effect was that Prime Minister\nChavalit Yongchaiyudh resigned under pressure on 6 November 1997, succeeded by\nopposition leader Chuan Leekpai. The second Leekpai government, in office from\nNovember 1997 to February 2001, tried to implement economic reforms based on\nIMF-guided neo-liberal capitalism. It pursued strict fiscal policies (keeping\ninterest rates high and cutting government spending), enacting 11 laws it\ncalled \"bitter medicine\" and critics called \"the 11 nation-selling laws\". The\nThai government and its supporters maintained that with these measures, the\nThai economy improved.\n\nIn 1999, Thailand had a positive GDP growth rate for the first time since the\ncrisis.[_citation needed_] Many critics, however, mistrusted the IMF and\nmaintained that government-spending cuts harmed the recovery. Unlike economic\nproblems in Latin America and Africa, they asserted, the Asian financial\ncrisis was born in the private sector and the IMF measures were inappropriate.\nThe positive growth rate in 1999 was because the country's GDP had gone down\nfor two consecutive years, as much as −10.5 percent in 1998 alone. In terms of\nthe baht, it was not until 2002 (in dollar terms, not until 2006) that\nThailand would regain its 1996 GDP. An additional 1999 loan from the Miyazawa\nPlan made the question of whether (or to what extent) the Leekpai government\nhelped the Thai economy controversial."

    "text": "An indirect effect of the financial crisis on Thai politics was the rise of\nThaksin Shinawatra. In reaction to the government's economic policies, Thaksin\nShinawatra's Thai Rak Thai Party won a landslide victory over Leekpai's\nDemocrat Party in the 2001 general election and took office in February 2001.\nAlthough weak export demand held the GDP growth rate to 2.2 percent in the\nfirst year of his administration, the first Thaksin Shinawatra government\nperformed well from 2002 to 2004 with growth rates of 5.3, 7.1 and 6.3 percent\nrespectively. His policy was later called Thaksinomics. During Thaksin's first\nterm, Thailand's economy regained momentum and the country paid its IMF debt\nby July 2003 (two years ahead of schedule). Despite criticism of Thaksinomics,\nThaksin's party won another landslide victory over the Democrat Party in the\n2005 general election. The official economic data related to Thaksinomics\nreveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to\nUS$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area rose from\nUS$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.\n\nPhuket in 2004. The Indian Ocean tsunami affected the economy\n\nThaksin's second term was less successful. On 26 December 2004, the Indian\nOcean tsunami occurred. In addition to the human toll, it impacted the first-\nquarter Thai GDP in 2005. The Yellow Shirts, a coalition of protesters against\nThaksin, also emerged in 2005. In 2006, Thaksin dissolved the parliament and\ncalled for a general election. The April 2006 general election was boycotted\nby the main opposition parties. Thaksin's party won again, but the election\nwas declared invalid by the Constitutional Court. Another general election,\nscheduled for October 2006, was cancelled. On 19 September a group of soldiers\ncalling themselves the Council for Democratic Reform under the Constitutional\nMonarchy and led by Sonthi Boonyaratglin organized a coup, ousting Thaksin\nwhile he was in New York preparing for a speech at the United Nations General\nAssembly. During the last year of the second Thaksin government, the Thai GDP\ngrew by 5.1 percent. Under his government, Thailand's overall ranking in the\nIMD Global Competitiveness Scoreboard rose from 31st in 2002 to 25th in 2005\nbefore falling to 29th in 2006.\n\nAfter the coup, Thailand's economy again suffered. From the last quarter of\n2006 through 2007, the country was ruled by a military junta led by General\nSurayud Chulanont, who was appointed prime minister in October 2006. The 2006\nGDP growth rate slowed from 6.1, 5.1 and 4.8 percent year-over-year in the\nfirst three-quarters to 4.4 percent (YoY) in Q4. Thailand's ranking on the IMD\nGlobal Competitiveness Scoreboard fell from 26th in 2005 to 29th in 2006 and\n33rd in 2007. Thaksin's plan for massive infrastructure investments was\nunmentioned until 2011, when his younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra entered\noffice. In 2007, the Thai economy grew by 5 percent. On 23 December 2007, the\nmilitary government held a general election. The pro-Thaksin People's Power\nParty, led by Samak Sundaravej, won a landslide victory over Abhisit\nVejjajiva's Democrat Party.\n\nUnder the People's Power Party-led government the country fell into political\nturmoil. This, combined with the 2008 financial crisis cut the 2008 Thai GDP\ngrowth rate to 2.5%. Before the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and the\nYellow Shirts reconvened in March 2008, the GDP grew by 6.5 percent (YoY) in\nthe first quarter of the year. Thailand's ranking on the IMD World\nCompetitiveness Scoreboard rose from 33rd in 2007 to 27th in 2008. The Yellow\nShirts occupied the Government House of Thailand in August 2008, and on 9\nSeptember the Constitutional Court delivered a decision removing Samak\nSundaravej from the prime ministership.\n\nSomchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, succeeded Samak Sundaravej as\nprime minister on 18 September. In the US, the 2008 financial crisis reached\nits peak while the Yellow Shirts were still in Government House, impeding\ngovernment operations. GDP growth dropped from 5.2 percent (YoY) in Q2 2008 to\n3.1 percent (YoY) and −4.1 percent (YoY) in Q3 and Q4. From 25 November to 3\nDecember 2008 the Yellow Shirts, protesting Somchai Wongsawat's prime\nministership, seized the two Bangkok airports, (Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang),\nand damaged Thailand's image and economy. On 2 December the Thai\nConstitutional Court issued a decision dissolving the People's Power Party,\nousting Somchai Wongsawat as prime minister.\n\nA coalition government under Abhisit Vejjajiva was formed in 2008\n\nBy the end of 2008, a coalition government led by Abhisit Vejjajiva's Democrat\nParty was formed: \"[The] legitimacy of the Abhisit government has been\nquestioned since the first day that the Democrat party took the office in 2008\nas it was allegedly formed by the military in a military camp\". The government\nwas under pressure from the 2008 financial crisis and the Red Shirts, who\nrefused to acknowledge Abhisit Vejjajiva's prime ministry and called for new\nelections as soon as possible. However, Abhisit rejected the call until he\ndissolved the parliament for a new election in May 2011. In 2009, his first\nyear in office, Thailand experienced a negative growth rate for the first time\nsince the 1997 Asian financial crisis: a GDP of −2.3 percent.\n\nIn 2010, the country's growth rate increased to 7.8 percent. However, with the\ninstability surrounding the major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand\nsettled at around 4–5 percent from highs of 5–7 percent under the previous\ncivilian administration—political uncertainty was identified as the primary\ncause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that\nthe Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1 percent GDP growth in\n2011, to 5.5 percent in 2012 and then 7.5 percent in 2013, due to the\naccommodating monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of\nfiscal stimulus measures introduced by the incumbent Yingluck Shinawatra\ngovernment.\n\nIn the first two-quarters of 2011, when the political situation was relatively\ncalm, the Thai GDP grew by 3.2 and 2.7 percent (YoY). Under Abhisit's\nadministration, Thailand's ranking fell from 26 in 2009, to 27 in 2010 and\n2011, and the country's infrastructure declined since 2009.\n\nIn the 2011 general election, the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai Party again won a\ndecisive victory over the Democrat Party, and Thaksin's youngest sister,\nYingluck Shinawatra, succeeded Abhisit as prime minister. Elected in July, the\nPheu Thai Party-led government began its administration in late-August, and\nwhen Yingluck entered office, the 2011 Thailand floods threatened the\ncountry—from 25 July 2011 to 16 January 2012, flood waters covered 65 of the\ncountry's 76 provinces. The World Bank assessed the total damage in December\n2011 and reported a cost of THB1.425 trillion (about US$45.7 billion).\n\nThe 2011 GDP growth rate fell to 0.1 percent, with a contraction of 8.9\npercent (YoY) in Q4 alone. The country's overall competitiveness ranking,\naccording to the IMD World Competitiveness Scoreboard, fell from 27 in 2011 to\n30 in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Thailand was recovering from the previous year's severe flood. The\nYingluck government planned to develop the country's infrastructure, ranging\nfrom a long-term water-management system to logistics. The Eurozone crisis\nreportedly harmed Thailand's economic growth in 2012, directly and indirectly\naffecting the country's exports. Thailand's GDP grew by 6.5 percent, with a\nheadline inflation rate of 3.02 percent, and a current account surplus of 0.7\npercent of the country's GDP.\n\nThe Thai baht depreciated during the 2013 Thai protests\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the Thai baht dropped to a three-year low due to the\npolitical unrest during the preceding months. According to _Bloomberg_ , the\nThai currency lost 4.6 percent over November and December, while the main\nstock index also dropped (9.1 percent).\n\nFollowing the Thai military coup in May 2014, Agence France Presse (AFP)\npublished an article claiming that the nation was on the \"verge of recession\".\nPublished on 17 June 2014, the article's main subject is the departure of\nnearly 180,000 Cambodians from Thailand due to fears of an immigration\n\"clampdown\", but concluded with information on the Thai economy's contraction\nof 2.1 percent quarter-on-quarter, from January to the end of March 2014.\n\nSince the cessation of the curfew that was enacted by the military in May\n2014, the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI)'s chairman, Supant\nMongkolsuthree, said that he projects growth of 2.5–3 percent for the Thai\neconomy in 2014, as well as a revitalisation of the Thai tourist industry in\nthe second half of 2014. Furthermore, Supant also cited the Board of\nInvestment's future consideration of a backlog of investment projects,\nestimated at 700 billion baht, as an economically beneficial process that\nwould occur around October 2014. Thailand's flagging economic performance led,\nat the end of 2015, to increased criticism of the National Council for Peace\nand Order's (NCPO) handling of the economy, both at home and in influential\nWestern media. The country's economic growth of 2.8% in the first quarter of\n2019 was recorded to be the slowest since 2014.\n\nThe military government unveiled its newest economic initiative, \"Thailand\n4.0\", in 2016. Thailand 4.0 is the \"...master plan to free Thailand from the\nmiddle-income trap, making it a high-income nation in five years.\"\n\nThe government narrative describes Thailand 1.0 as the agrarian economy of\nThailand decades ago. Thailand 1.0 gave way to Thailand 2.0, when the nation's\neconomy moved on to light industry, textiles, and food processing. Thailand\n3.0 describes the present day, with heavy industry and energy accounting for\nup to 70 percent of the Thai GDP. Thailand 4.0 is described as an economy\ndriven by high-tech industries and innovation that will lead to the production\nof value-added products and services. According to General Prayut Chan-o-cha,\nthe prime minister, Thailand 4.0 is composed of three elements: 1. Make\nThailand a high-income nation, 2. Make Thailand a more inclusive society, and\n3. Focus on sustainable growth and development.\n\nCritics of Thailand 4.0 point out that Thailand lacks the specialists and\nexperts, especially in high-technology, needed to modernise the Thai industry.\n\"...the government will have to allow the import of foreign specialists to\nhelp bring forward Thailand 4.0,\" said Somchai Jitsuchon, research director\nfor inclusive development at the Thailand Development Research Institute\n(TDRI). \"...that won't be easy as local professional associations will oppose\nthe idea as they want to reserve those professional careers for Thais only\".\nHe went on to point out that only 56 percent of Thailand's population has\naccess to the Internet, an obstacle to the creation of a high-tech workforce.\nA major thrust of Thailand 4.0 is encouraging a move to robotic manufacturing.\nBut Thailand's membership in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), makes cheap\nworkers from neighbouring countries even more readily available, which will\nmake it harder to make the economic case to switch to robots. Somchai also\npointed out that the bureaucratic nature of the Thai government will make\nrealisation of Thailand 4.0 difficult. Every action plan calls for results\nfrom several ministries, \"all of which are big, clumsily-run organisations\"\nslow to perform.\n\nIn September 2020, World Bank forecast that Thai economy would contract 8.9%\nby the end of the year due to COVID-19 pandemic. The Thai government cut jet\nfuel tax since February 2020.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn August 2024, the dismissal of Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin\nexacerbated Thailand's economic difficulties, impeding the implementation of\nsignificant financial measures. This political upheaval intensified existing\nissues such as high household debt and economic stagnation, further\nundermining investor confidence and economic stability."

The GDP at\ncurrent prices shows that from 1980 to 2012 the Thai economy has expanded\nnearly sixteen-fold when measured in baht, or nearly eleven-fold when measured\nin dollars. This makes Thailand the 32nd-biggest economy in the world,\naccording to the IMF. With regard to GDP, Thailand has undergone five periods\nof economic growth. From 1980 to 1984, the economy has grown by an average of\n5.4 percent per year. Regional businesses account for 70 percent of GDP, with\nBangkok contributing 30 percent.\n\nAfter the 1984 baht devaluation and the 1985 Plaza Accord, a significant\namount of foreign direct investment (mainly from Japan) raised the average\ngrowth rate per year to 8.8 percent from 1985 to 1996 before slumping to −5.9\npercent per year from 1997 to 1998. From 1999 to 2006, Thailand averaged a\ngrowth rate of 5.0% per year. Since 2007, the country has faced a number of\nchallenges: a military coup in late 2006, political turmoil from 2008 to 2011,\nthe 2008 financial crisis, floods in 2010 and 2011, and the Euro area crisis.\nAs a result, from 2007 to 2012 the average GDP growth rate was 3.25% per year.\n\nThailand suffers by comparison with neighboring countries in terms of GDP per\ncapita. In 2011, China's nominal GDP per capita surpassed Thailand's, giving\nthe latter the lowest nominal GDP per capita of its peers. According to the\nIMF, in 2012 Thailand ranked 92nd in the world in its nominal GDP per capita."

As recently as 1980, agriculture\nsupplied 70 percent of employment. In 2008, agriculture, forestry and fishing\ncontributed 8.4 percent to GDP; in rural areas, farm jobs supply half of\nemployment. Rice is the most important crop in the country and Thailand had\nlong been the world's number one exporter of rice, until recently falling\nbehind both India and Vietnam. It is a major exporter of shrimp. Other crops\ninclude coconuts, corn, rubber, soybeans, sugarcane and tapioca.\n\nThailand is the world's third-largest seafood exporter. Overall fish exports\nwere worth around US$3 billion in 2014, according to the Thai Frozen Foods\nAssociation. Thailand's fishing industry employs more than 300,000 persons.\n\nIn 1985, Thailand designated 25 percent of its land area for forest protection\nand 15 percent for timber production. Forests have been set aside for\nconservation and recreation, and timber forests are available for the forestry\nindustry. Between 1992 and 2001, exports of logs and sawn timber increased\nfrom 50,000 to 2,000,000 cubic meters per year.\n\nThe regional avian-flu outbreak contracted Thailand's agricultural sector in\n2004, and the tsunami of 26 December devastated the Andaman Sea fishing\nindustry. In 2005 and 2006, agricultural GDP was reported to have contracted\nby 10 percent.\n\nThailand is the world's second-largest exporter of gypsum (after Canada),\nalthough government policy limits gypsum exports to support prices. In 2003\nThailand produced more than 40 different minerals, with an annual value of\nabout US$740 million. In September 2003, to encourage foreign investment in\nmining the government relaxed its restrictions on mining by foreign companies\nand reduced mineral royalties owed to the state."

    "text": "Thailand's 2004 energy consumption was estimated at 3.4 quadrillion British\nthermal units, representing about 0.7 percent of total world energy\nconsumption. Thailand is a net importer of oil and natural gas; however, the\ngovernment is promoting ethanol to reduce imports of petroleum and the\ngasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n\nIn 2005 Thailand's daily oil consumption of 838,000 barrels per day (133,200\nm3/d) exceeded its production of 306,000 barrels per day (48,700 m3/d).\nThailand's four oil refineries have a combined capacity of 703,100 barrels per\nday (111,780 m3/d). The government is considering a regional oil-processing\nand transportation hub serving south-central China. In 2004, Thailand's\nnatural-gas consumption of 1,055 billion cubic feet (2.99×1010 m3) exceeded\nits production of 790 billion cubic feet (2.2×1010 m3).\n\nThailand's 2004 estimated coal consumption of 30.4 million short tons exceeded\nits production of 22.1 million. As of January 2007, proven oil reserves\ntotaled 290 million barrels (46,000,000 m3) and proven natural-gas reserves\nwere 14.8 trillion cubic feet (420 km3). In 2003, recoverable coal reserves\ntotalled 1,493 million short tons.\n\nIn 2005, Thailand used about 118 billion kilowatt hours of electricity.\nConsumption rose by 4.7 percent in 2006, to 133 billion kWh. According to the\nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand (the national electricity\nutility), power consumption by residential users is increasing due to more\nfavorable rates for residential customers than for the industry and business\nsectors. Thailand's electric utility and petroleum companies (also state-\ncontrolled) are being restructured."

By 2003, nonperforming assets had been cut in half (to\nabout 30 percent).\n\nDespite a return to profitability, Thailand's banks continue to struggle with\nunrealized losses and inadequate capital. The government is considering\nreforms, including an integrated financial regulatory agency which would\nenable the Bank of Thailand to focus on monetary policy. In addition, the\ngovernment is attempting to strengthen the financial sector through the\nconsolidation of commercial, state- and foreign-owned institutions. The 2004\nFinancial Sector Reform Master Plan provides tax breaks to financial\ninstitutions engaging in mergers and acquisitions. The reform program has been\ndeemed successful by outside experts. In 2007 there were three state-owned\ncommercial banks, five state-owned specialized banks, fifteen Thai commercial\nbanks, and seventeen foreign banks in Thailand.\n\nThe Bank of Thailand sought to stem the flow of foreign funds into the country\nin December 2006, leading to the largest one-day drop in stock prices on the\nStock Exchange of Thailand since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The sell-off\nby foreign investors amounted to more than US$708 million.\n\nIn 2019, the Bank of Thailand kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a\nfourth straight meeting, with the concerns of high household debt and\nfinancial stability risks."

About 49 percent\nwere employed in agriculture, 37 percent in the service sector and 14 percent\nin industry. In 2005 women constituted 48 percent of the labour force, and\nheld an increased share of professional jobs. Thailand's unemployment rate was\n0.9 percent as of 2014, down from two percent in 2004. A World Bank survey\nshowed that 83.5 percent of the Thai workforce is unskilled.\n\nA joint study by the Quality Learning Foundation (QLF), Dhurakij Pundit\nUniversity (DPU), and the World Bank suggests that 12 million Thais may lose\ntheir jobs to automation over the next 20 years, wiping out one-third of the\npositions in the workforce. The World Bank estimates that Thai workers are two\ntimes and five times less productive than Malaysian and Singaporean workers\nrespectively. The report assesses the average output of Thai workers at\nUS$25,000 (879,200 baht) in 2014 compared to Malaysia's US$50,000 and\nUS$122,000 for Singapore. A 2016 report by the International Labor Office\n(ILO) estimates that over 70 percent of Thai workers are in danger of being\ndisplaced by automation. Factories in Thailand are estimated to be adding from\n2,500–4,500 industrial robots per year.\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, 71,000 Thais worked abroad in foreign countries. Taiwan\nemployed the most Thai employees overall with 59,220 persons, followed by\nSouth Korea at 24,228, Israel at 23,479, Singapore at 20,000, and the UAE at\n14,000. Most employees work in metal production, agriculture, textile\nmanufacturing, and electronic part manufacturing fields. As of 2020, Thai\nmigrant labourers overseas generate remittances worth 140 billion baht.\n\nThe number of migrant workers in Thailand is unknown. The official\nnumber—1,339,834 registered migrant workers from Cambodia, Laos, and\nMyanmar—reported by the Office of Foreign Workers Administration under the\nMinistry of Labour, represents only legal migrant workers. Many more are\npresumed to be non-registered or illegal migrants. The Thailand Development\nResearch Institute (TDRI) estimates that there may yet be more illegal migrant\nworkers than legal ones in Thailand."

    "text": "Thai export destinations, 2006.\n\nChina has replaced the United States as Thailand's largest export market while\nthe latter still holds its position as its second-largest supplier (after\nJapan). While Thailand's traditional major markets have been North America,\nJapan, and Europe, economic recovery in Thailand's regional trading partners\nhas helped Thai export growth.\n\nAs of 2022, China is Thailand's largest trading partner with 3.69 trillion\nbaht ($106 billion) worth of trade, accounting for almost 20% of all Thai\nforeign trade. In 2022, China also became the largest foreign investor in\nThailand, totaling 77.4 billion baht, more than Japan and USA.\n\nRecovery from financial crisis depended heavily on increased exports to the\nrest of Asia and the United States. Since 2005 the increase in export of\nautomobiles from Japanese manufacturers (particularly Toyota, Nissan and\nIsuzu) has helped improve the trade balance, with over one million cars\nproduced annually since then. Thailand has joined the ranks of the world's top\nten automobile-exporting nations.\n\nMachinery and parts, vehicles, integrated circuits, chemicals, crude oil,\nfuels, iron and steel are among Thailand's principal imports. The increase in\nimports reflects a need to fuel production of high-tech items and vehicles.\n\nThailand is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Cairns Group\nof agricultural exporters and the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), and has\npursued free-trade agreements. A China-Thailand Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\nbegan in October 2003. This agreement was limited to agricultural products,\nwith a more comprehensive FTA planned to be signed by 2010. Thailand also has\na limited free-trade agreement with India (since 2003) and a comprehensive\nAustralia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement, which began on 1 January 2005.\n\nThailand began free trade negotiations with Japan in February 2004, and an in-\nprinciple agreement was agreed to in September 2005. Negotiations for a US-\nThailand free trade agreement have been underway, with a fifth round of\nmeetings held in November 2005.\n\nSeveral industries are restricted to foreign investment by the 1999 Foreign\nBusiness Act. These industries include media, agriculture, distribution of\nland, professional services, tourism, hotels, and construction. Share\nownership of companies engaged in these activities must be limited to a 49\npercent minority stake. The 1966 US-Thailand Treaty of Amity and Economic\nRelations provides exemption of these restrictions for shareholders with\nUnited States citizenship.\n\nThe Bangkok area is one of the most prosperous parts of Thailand and heavily\ndominates the national economy, with the infertile northeast being the\npoorest. A concern of successive Thai governments, and a focus of the recently\nousted Thaksin government, has been to reduce the regional disparities which\nhave been exacerbated by rapid economic growth in Bangkok and financial\ncrisis.\n\nAlthough little economic investment reaches other parts of the country except\nfor tourist zones, the government has stimulated provincial economic growth in\nthe eastern seaboard and the Chiang Mai area. Despite talk of other regional\ndevelopment, these three regions and other tourist zones still dominate the\nnational economy.\n\nAlthough some US rights holders report good cooperation with Thai enforcement\nauthorities (including the Royal Thai Police and Royal Thai Customs), Thailand\nremained on the priority watch list in 2012. The United States is encouraged\nthat Thailand's government has affirmed its commitment to improving IPR\nprotection and enforcement, but more must be done for Thailand to be removed\nfrom the list.\n\nAlthough the economy has grown moderately since 1999, future performance\ndepends on continued reform of the financial sector, corporate-debt\nrestructuring, attracting foreign investment and increasing exports.\nTelecommunications, roads, electricity generation and ports showed increasing\nstrain during the period of sustained economic growth. Thailand is\nexperiencing a growing shortage of engineers and skilled technical personnel."

Schneider defines the shadow\neconomy as market-based legal production that is intentionally concealed to\navoid taxes, social-security payments, labour standards or administrative\nrules. His definition excludes purely illegal activities such as robbery,\nburglary or drug trafficking. The shadow economy also encompasses widespread\nloan sharking.
