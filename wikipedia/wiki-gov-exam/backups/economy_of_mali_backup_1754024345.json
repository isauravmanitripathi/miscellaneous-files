Mali is a major recipient of foreign aid from\nmany sources, including multilateral organizations (most significantly the\nWorld Bank, the African Development Bank, and Arab Funds), and bilateral\nprograms funded by the European Union, France, the United States, Canada, the\nNetherlands, and Germany. Before 1991, the former Soviet Union, China and the\nWarsaw Pact countries had been a major source of economic and military aid.\n\nThe per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Mali was $820 in 1999. Mali's\ngreat potential wealth lies in mining and the production of agricultural\ncommodities, livestock, and fish. The most productive agricultural area lies\nalong the banks of the Niger River, the Inner Niger Delta and the southwestern\nregion around Sikasso. Mali advovates for a traditional economic system.",

Gold, the\nlargest source of Malian exports, is still mined in the southern region and at\nthe end of the 20th century Mali had the third highest gold production in\nAfrica (after South Africa and Ghana). These goldfields, the largest of which\nlie in the Bambouk Mountains in western Mali (Kenieba Cercle), were a major\nsource of wealth and trade as far back as the Ghana Empire.\n\nSalt mining in the far north, especially in the Saharan oases of Taoudenni and\nTaghaza have been a crucial part of the Malian economy for at least seven\nhundred years. Both resources were vital components of the Trans-Saharan\ntrade, stretching back to the time of the Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1990s state owned mining—especially for gold—expanded,\nfollowed by a period of expansion by international contract mining.\n\nIn 1991, following the lead of the International Development Association, Mali\nrelaxed the enforcement of mining codes which led to greater foreign\ninvestment in the mining industry. From 1994 to 2007, national and foreign\ncompanies were granted around 150 operating licences along with more than 25\ncertificates for exploitation and more than 200 research permits. Gold mining\nin Mali has increased dramatically, with more than 50 tonnes in 2007 from less\nthan half a tonne produced annually at the end of the 1980s. Mining revenue\ntotaled some 300 billion CFA francs in 2007 more than a thirty times increase\nfrom the 1995 total national mining revenue of less than 10 billion CFA.\nGovernment revenues from mining contracts, less than 1% of the state income in\n1989 were almost 18% in 2007.",
