    "text": "Lesotho's early economic history was shaped by its integration into the\nregional economy of Southern Africa, a heavy reliance on labor migration and\nproductivity in agriculture. In the 19th century, Lesotho was a significant\nagricultural exporter, supplying grain and mohair to South African mining\ncamps. However, by the early 20th century, worsening land shortages and\nunfavorable climate conditions shifted Lesotho into a net food importer and a\nlabor reserve for South African mines and farms. Labor migration became a\ncentral economic pillar, with tens of thousands of Basotho men seeking\nemployment in South Africa throughout the 20th century. By 1982, over 100,000\nBasotho were working in South African industries.\n\nLesotho's independence on the 4th of October 1966 marked the beginning of\nincreased international aid flows, with Britain, Sweden, and multilateral\ndonors providing financial assistance. And early aid efforts were largely\ndirected at agriculture, based on the assumption that Lesotho was a purely\nagrarian society. Large-scale rural development projects, including those\nfunded by the World Bank and USAID, repeatedly failed due to, among other\nreasons, poor planning and a lack of local participation.\n\nPolitical instability influenced aid patterns. Following a 1970 coup, British\nand Swedish aid was temporarily suspended but resumed later that year. Lesotho\nalso leveraged its opposition to apartheid to attract more aid, particularly\nafter the 1976 Soweto Uprising and Transkei border conflicts. By 1979,\ndevelopment assistance had risen to $64 million.\n\nUntil the political insecurity in September 1998, Lesotho's economy had grown\nsteadily since 1992. The riots, however, destroyed nearly 80% of commercial\ninfrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns in the country, having a\ndisastrous effect on the country's economy. Nonetheless, the country has\ncompleted several IMF Structural Adjustment Programs, and inflation declined\nsubstantially over the course of the 1990s. Lesotho's trade deficit, however,\nis quite large, with exports representing only a small fraction of imports.\n\nThe global economic crisis hit the Lesotho economy hard through loss of\ntextile exports and jobs in the sector due largely to the economic slowdown in\nthe United States which is a major export destination, reduced diamond mining\nand exports, including weak prices for diamonds; drop in SACU revenues due to\nthe economic slowdown in the South African economy, and reduction in worker\nremittances due to weakening of the South African economy and contraction of\nthe mining sector and related job losses in South Africa. In 2009, GDP growth\nslowed to 0.9 percent.",
