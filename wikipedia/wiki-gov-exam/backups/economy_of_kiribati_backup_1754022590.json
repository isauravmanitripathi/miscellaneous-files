    "text": "The expiration of phosphate deposits in 1979 had a devastating impact on the\neconomy. Receipts from phosphates had accounted for roughly 80% of export\nearnings and 50% of government revenue. Per capita GDP was more than cut in\nhalf between 1979 and 1981. A sovereign wealth fund financed by phosphate\nearnings was established in 1956. In 2008, the Revenue Equalization Reserve\nFund was valued at US$ 400 million. Prudent management of the Reserve Fund\nwill be vital for the long-term welfare of the country.\n\nIn 2009 the RERF was valued at A$570.5 million. The RERF assets declined from\nA$637 million (420 percent of GDP) in 2007 to A$570.5 million (350 percent of\nGDP) in 2009. Due to the 2008 financial crisis, the RERF was reduced due to\nfailed Icelandic banks, as well as withdrawals made by the government of\nKiribati to finance budgetary shortfalls.\n\nIn May 2011 the IMF country report described the impact of the GFC as being\nthat “Kiribati has been affected by the global crisis through a fall in\nremittances and large decline in the value of its wealth and pension funds—the\nRevenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) and the Kiribati Provident Fund. The\nspike in food and fuel prices in 2008 has already taken a toll on economic\nactivity. Vulnerabilities to climate change, including coastline erosion, have\nalso worsened.”\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from\nabroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker\nremittances, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production\nability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and\nmanufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for\nfinancing .[_citation needed_]\n\nFishing fleets from South Korea, Japan, People's Republic of China, Taiwan,\nand the United States pay a licensing fee in order to operate in Kiribati's\nterritorial waters. These licenses produced A$25.4 million in 2007, A$32.2\nmillion in 2008 and A$29.5 million in 2009. The existence of El Niño climatic\nconditions boosted the local catch. Due to its small size and spread-out\nnature, however, Kiribati also loses untold millions of income per year from\nillegal, unlicensed fishing in its exclusive economic zone.\n\nVisitor arrivals are predominantly business-related with total visitor\narrivals of 3,380 in 2008 and 3,915 in 2009. These visitors provide $5–$10\nmillion in revenue. Tourism attractions include World War II battle sites,\ngame fishing, ecotourism, and Caroline Island, situated just inside the\nInternational Date Line and the first place on earth to celebrate every New\nYear.\n\nMost islanders engage in subsistence activities ranging from fishing to the\ngrowing of food crops like bananas, breadfruit, and papaya. The leading export\nis the coconut product copra, which accounts for about two-thirds of export\nrevenue. Other exports include pet fish, shark fins, and seaweed. Kiribati's\nprincipal trading partner is Australia.\n\nRemittances from Kiribati seamen working on foreign flagged ships provided\nA$11.6 million in 2009.\n\nIn May 2011 the IMF country report assessment of the Economy of Kiribati is\nthat: “After two years of contraction, the economy recovered in the second\nhalf of 2010 and inflation pressure dissipated. It is estimated to have grown\nby 1¾ percent for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra\nproduction, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in\nretail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20 percent compared to 2009, although\nfrom a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices,\ninflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory,\nreflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as\nthe domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth\nin the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled. But it\nstarted to pick up in the second half of 2010 as the recovery gained\ntraction.”",
