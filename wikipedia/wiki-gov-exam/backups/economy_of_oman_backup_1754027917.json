    "text": "The **economy of Oman** is mainly centered around its oil sector, with fishing\nand trading activities located around its coastal regions. When oil was\ndiscovered in 1964, the production and export increased significantly. The\ngovernment has made plans to diversify away from oil under its privatization\nand Omanization policies. This has helped raise Oman's GDP per capita\ncontinuously in the past 50 years. It grew 339% in the 1960s, reaching a peak\ngrowth of 1,370% in the 1970s. Similar to the pricing of all other\ncommodities, the price of oil is subject to significant fluctuations over\ntime, especially those associated with the business cycle. A commodity's price\nwill rise sharply when demand, like that for oil, outpaces supply; meanwhile,\nwhen supply outpaces demand, prices will fall.\n\nIt scaled back to a modest 13% growth in the 1980s and rose again to 34% in\nthe 1990s. Oman joined the Gulf Cooperation Council in 1981 with the aim of\nestablishing a customs union, a common market and a common currency.\n\nPetroleum is responsible for 64% of all export revenue, 45% of government\nincome, and 50% of GDP. Given that it accounts for half of the Sultanate of\nOman's GDP, the petroleum products industry is one of the most significant in\nthe Omani economy.\n\nOman's economy heavily relies on cement, a vital component of the construction\nindustry. Cement plays a crucial role in facilitating urbanization,\ninfrastructure development, and overall economic expansion. The cement\nindustry contributes to Oman's economy by providing employment opportunities,\nboth directly and indirectly. It also generates revenue through taxes and fees\nand contributes to the development of related sectors, such as logistics and\ntransportation.",

    "text": "Traditional souqs like this one at Muttrah are very common in Oman and have\nformed the bulk of the Omani economy in the past.\n\nOman liberalised its markets in an effort to accede to the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) and gained membership in 2000. The Director of the\nSultanate of Oman's delegation to the WTO is Hilda al-Hinai. Further, on 20\nJuly 2006 the U.S. Congress approved the US-Oman Free Trade Agreement. This\ntook effect on 1 January 2009, eliminating tariff barriers on all consumer and\nindustrial products. It also provides strong protections for foreign\nbusinesses investing in Oman.\n\nThe government also undertook some important policy measures during 2018 with\nthe establishment of a commercial arbitration center, the adoption of a new\ncommercial companies' law, and a further streamlining of licensing processes\nthrough Invest Easy in order to improve the business and investment climate\nand promote private sector-led growth in the Sultanate.\n\nOman's economy and revenues from petroleum products have enabled Oman's\ndramatic development over the past 50 years. Notably however, Oman is not a\nmember of OPEC, although it has coordinated with the group in recent years.\n\nPetrochemical tanks in Sohar\n\nOil was first discovered in the interior near Fahud in the western desert in\n1964. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) began production in August 1967. The\nOmani Government owns 60% of PDO, and foreign interests own 40% (Royal Dutch\nShell owns 34%; the remaining 6% is owned by Compagnie Francaise des Petroles\n[Total] and Partex). In 1976, Oman's oil production rose to 366,000 barrels\n(58,000 m³) per day but declined gradually to about 285,000 barrels (45,000\nm³) per day in late 1980 due to the depletion of recoverable reserves. From\n1981 to 1986, Oman compensated for declining oil prices, by increasing\nproduction levels to 600,000 b/d. With the collapse of oil prices in 1986,\nhowever, revenues dropped dramatically. Production was cut back temporarily in\ncoordination with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),\nand production levels again reached 600,000 b/d by mid-1987, which helped\nincrease revenues. By mid-2000, production had climbed to more than 900,000\nb/d where they remain. Natural gas reserves, which increasingly provide the\nfuel for power generation and desalination, stand at 18 trillion ft³ (510\nkm3). The Oman LNG processing plant located in Sur was opened in 2000, with\nproduction capacity of 6.6 million tons/YR, as well as unsubstantial gas\nliquids, including condensates.\n\nOman's 10th five-year plan (2020–2025) is the first implementation plan of\nVision 2040, and will focus its efforts towards achieving economic\ndiversification. The plan for economic diversification aims to move Oman away\nfrom the oil-and-gas-based sources of income, and has earmarked five sectors\nthat have high growth potential and economic returns. These are agriculture\nand fisheries, manufacturing, logistics and transport, energy and mining, and\ntourism.\n\nAccording to the Central Bank of Oman's Annual Report 2018, the Omani crude\noil price averaged at US$69.7 a barrel in 2018 as compared to US$51.3 per\nbarrel during 2017. The recovery in oil prices also contributed to growth in\nnon-oil economic activities, reflecting inter-linkages, although the\ndependency of non-oil activities on oil activities has somewhat weakened in\nthe last few years.\n\nAccording to the World Bank growth is expected to increase over 2020–21,\ndriven in part by a large increase in gas production from the new Khazzan gas\nproject, and infrastructure spending plans in both oil and non-oil sectors.\nNotably, with Khazzan phase-I becoming operational, the natural gas under the\npetroleum sector is also emerging as a significant contributor to the Omani\neconomy, with BP committing to invest US$16 Billion developing the field.\nMeanwhile, the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD) attracted $14.2\nbillion worth of investments in the form of usufruct agreements signed till\nthe end of 2018. With a land area of 2,000 km2 and 70 km of coastline along\nthe Arabian Sea, the Duqm Special Economic Zone is the largest in the Middle\nEast and North Africa region and ranks among the largest in the world. Duqm is\nan integrated economic development composed of zones: a sea port, industrial\narea, new town, fishing harbor, tourist zone, a logistics center and an\neducation and training zone, all of which are supported by a multimodal\ntransport system that connects it with nearby regions.\n\nOn the fiscal front, government expenditure also increased noticeably in 2018\ndue to higher spending on oil & gas production, defence, subsidies and\nelevated interest payments. The government debt also increased to RO 14,492 in\n2018 – with the debt to GDP ratio expected increased to 58 percent by 2020,\nleading to constraints on the ability of fiscal spending to support growth and\nraising sustainability concerns.",

    "text": "The Omanisation programme has been in operation since 1999, working toward\nreplacing expatriates with trained Omani personnel. The goal of this\ninitiative is to provide jobs for the rapidly growing Omani population. The\nstate has allotted subsidies for companies to hire local employees not only to\ngradually reduce reliance on foreign workers but also to overcome an\noverwhelming employment preference on the part of Omanis for government jobs.\n\nBy the end of 1999, the number of Omanis in government services exceeded the\nset target of 72%, and in most departments reached 86% of employees. The\nMinistry has also stipulated fixed Omanisation targets in six areas of the\nprivate sector. Most companies have registered Omanisation plans. Since April\n1998 a 'green card' has been awarded to companies that meet their Omanisation\ntargets and comply with the eligibility criteria for labour relations. The\nnames of these companies are published in the local press and they receive\npreferential treatment in their dealings with the Ministry. Academics working\non various aspects of Omanisation include Ingo Forstenlechner from United Arab\nEmirates University and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.[_citation needed_]\n\nOmanisation, however, in the private sector is not always successful. One of\nthe reasons is that jobs are still filled by expatriates because of the lower\nwages. Studies reveal that an increasing number of the job openings in the\nprivate sector pay the official minimum salary for nationals, which is an\nunattractive employment prospect for the locals. There is also the problem of\nplacing Omani workers in senior positions due to the fact that a significant\nchunk of the workforce is composed of young and inexperienced workers."

    "text": "In order to meet the training and Omanisation requirements of the banking\nsector, the Omani Institute of Bankers was established in 1983 and has since\nplayed a leading role in increasing the number of Omanis working in the\nsector. The Central Bank monitors the progress made by the commercial banks\nwith Omanisation and in July 1995 issued a circular stipulating that by the\nyear 2000, at least 75% of senior and middle management positions should be\nheld by Omanis. In the clerical grades 95% of staff should be Omanised and\n100% in all other grades. At the end of 1999, no less than 98.8% of all\npositions were held by Omanis. Women made up 60% of the total. During 2001 the\npercentage of Omanis employed at senior and middle management levels went up\nfrom 76.7% to 78.8%. There was a slight increase in the clerical grade\npercentage to 98.7%, while the non-clerical grades had already reached 100%\nOmanisation in 1998. The banking sector currently employs 2,113 senior and\nmiddle managers supported by 4,757 other staff.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Ministry has issued a decision regulating tourist guides, who in future\nwill be required to have a license. This Ministerial decision aims at\nencouraging professionalism in the industry as well as providing career\nopportunities for Omanis who will be encouraged to learn foreign languages so\nas to replace foreign tour guides. In January 1996, a major step forward in\nthe training of Omanis in the hotel industry came with the opening of the\nNational Hospitality Institute (NHI). The institute is a public company quoted\non the Omani Stock exchange. In February 1997, the first batch of 55 male and\nfemale trainees, sponsored by the Vocational Training Authority, were awarded\ntheir first level certificates and were given on-the-job training in several\nhotels. In May 1999, the fourth batch of 95 trainees obtained their NVQs,\nbringing the number of Omanis trained by the institute to around 450. Omanis\nnow make up 37% of the 34,549 employees in the hotel and catering business,\nwhich exceeds the Omanisation target of 30% set by the Government. The NHI has\nalso trained catering staff from the Sultan's Armed Forces and has launched a\ntwo-year tour guide course, which includes language training, safe driving,\nfirst aid and a knowledge of local history and geography.[_citation needed_]"
