    "text": "The **economy of Nicaragua** is focused primarily on the agricultural sector.\nNicaragua itself is the least developed country in Central America, and the\nsecond least developed in the Americas by nominal GDP, behind only Haiti. In\nrecent years, under the administrations of Daniel Ortega, the Nicaraguan\neconomy has expanded somewhat, following the Great Recession, when the\ncountry's economy actually contracted by 1.5%, due to decreased export demand\nin the American and Central American markets, lower commodity prices for key\nagricultural exports, and low remittance growth. The economy saw 4.5% growth\nin 2010 thanks to a recovery in export demand and growth in its tourism\nindustry. Nicaragua's economy continues to post growth, with preliminary\nindicators showing the Nicaraguan economy growing an additional 5% in 2011.\nConsumer Price inflation have also curtailed since 2008, when Nicaragua's\ninflation rate hovered at 19.82%. In 2009 and 2010, the country posted lower\ninflation rates, 3.68% and 5.45%, respectively. Remittances are a major source\nof income, equivalent to 15% of the country's GDP, which originate primarily\nfrom Costa Rica, the United States, and European Union member states.\nApproximately one million Nicaraguans contribute to the remittance sector of\nthe economy.\n\nIn early 2004, Nicaragua secured some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction\nunder the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries initiative. In April 2006, the US-Central America Free Trade\nAgreement went into effect, expanding export opportunities for Nicaragua's\nagricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles and apparel account for nearly\n60% of Nicaragua's exports. In October 2007, the IMF approved an additional\npoverty reduction and growth facility program in support of the government's\neconomic plans. Nicaragua relies on international economic assistance to meet\ninternal- and external-debt financing obligations, although foreign donors\ncurtailed this funding in response to widespread allegations of electoral\nfraud in Nicaragua's November 2008 elections.",

    "text": "Unemployment was 7.2% in 2023. Nicaragua suffers from persistent trade and\nbudget deficits and a high debt-service burden, leaving it highly dependent on\nforeign assistance—which represented almost 25% of GDP in 2001.\n\nOne of the key engines of economic growth has been production for export.\nAlthough traditional products such as coffee, meat, and sugar continued to\nlead the list of Nicaraguan exports, the fastest growth is now in\nnontraditional exports: textile and apparel; gold; seafood; and new\nagricultural products such as peanuts, sesame, melons, and onions. In 2007,\nexports topped US$1 billion for the first time in Nicaraguan history.\n\nNicaragua is primarily an agricultural country, but construction, mining,\nfisheries, and general commerce also have been expanding during the last few\nyears. Foreign private capital inflows topped $300 million in 1999 but, due to\neconomic and political uncertainty, fell to less than $100 million in 2001. In\nthe last 12 years, tourism has grown 394%, the rapid growth has led it to\nbecome Nicaragua's second largest source of foreign capital. Less than three\nyears ago, the nation's tourism budget was U.S. $400,000; today, it is over $2\nmillion. Nicaragua's economy has also produced a construction boom, the\nmajority of which is in and around Managua.\n\nNicaragua faces a number of challenges in stimulating rapid economic growth.\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) program is currently being followed, with\nthe aim of attracting investment, creating jobs, and reducing poverty by\nopening the economy to foreign trade. This process was boosted in late 2000\nwhen Nicaragua reached the decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) debt relief initiative. However, HIPC benefits were delayed\nbecause Nicaragua subsequently fell \"off track\" from its IMF program. The\ncountry also has been grappling with a string of bank failures that began in\nAugust 2000. Moreover, Nicaragua continues to lose international reserves due\nto its growing fiscal deficits.\n\nThe country is still a recovering economy and it continues to implement\nfurther reforms, on which aid from the IMF is conditional. In 2005, finance\nministers of the leading eight industrialized nations (G8) agreed to forgive\nsome of Nicaragua's foreign debt, as part of the HIPC program. According to\nthe World Bank Nicaragua's GDP was around $4.9 US billion dollars. Recently,\nin March 2007, Poland and Nicaragua signed an agreement to write off $30.6\nmillion which was borrowed by the Nicaraguan government in the 1980s.\n\nThe U.S. is the country's largest trading partner, providing 25% of\nNicaragua's imports and receiving about 60% of its exports. About 25 wholly or\npartly owned subsidiaries of U.S. companies operate in Nicaragua. The largest\nof those operations are in the energy, communications, manufacturing,\nfisheries, and shrimp farming sectors. Opportunities exist for expanded\nforeign investments in those sectors, as well as in tourism, mining,\nfranchising, and the distribution of imported consumer, manufacturing, and\nagricultural goods. There also are copper mines in northeastern Nicaragua.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2012 was\nestimated at US$20.04 billion, and GDP per capita in PPP at US$3,300, making\nNicaragua the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. The service\nsector is the largest component of GDP at 56.7%, followed by the industrial\nsector at 25.8%(2012). Agriculture represents 17.5% of GDP and it's the\nlargest percentage in a Central American country. Nicaraguan labor force is\nestimated at 2.961 million of which 28% is occupied in agriculture, 19% in the\nindustry sector and 53% in the service sector (2012).",

    "text": "Coffee became Nicaragua's principal crop in the 1870s, a position it still\nheld in 1992 despite the growing importance of other crops. Cotton gained\nimportance in the late 1940s, and in 1992 was the second biggest export\nearner. In the early 20th century, Nicaraguan governments were reluctant to\ngive concessions to the large United States banana companies, and bananas\nnever attained the level of prominence in Nicaragua that they reached in\nNicaragua's Central American neighbors; bananas were grown in the country,\nhowever, and were generally the third largest export earner in the post-World\nWar II period. Beef and animal byproducts, the most important agricultural\nexport for the three centuries before the coffee boom of the late 19th\ncentury, were still important commodities in 1992.\n\nFrom the end of World War II to the early 1960s, the growth and\ndiversification of the agricultural sector drove the nation's economic\nexpansion. From the early 1960s until the increased fighting in 1977 caused by\nthe Sandinista revolution, agriculture remained a robust and significant part\nof the economy, although its growth slowed somewhat in comparison with the\nprevious postwar decades. Statistics for the next fifteen years, however, show\nstagnation and then a drop in agricultural production.\n\nThe agricultural sector declined precipitously in the 1980s. Until the late\n1970s, Nicaragua's agricultural export system generated 40 percent of the\ncountry's GDP, 60 percent of national employment, and 80 percent of foreign\nexchange earnings. Throughout the 1980s, the Contras destroyed or disrupted\ncoffee harvests as well as other key income-generating crops. Private industry\nstopped investing in agriculture because of uncertain returns. Land was taken\nout of production of export crops to expand plantings of basic grain. Many\ncoffee plants succumbed to disease.\n\nIn 1989, the fifth successive year of decline, farm production declined by\nroughly 7 percent in comparison with the previous year. Production of basic\ngrains fell as a result of Hurricane Joan in 1988 and a drought in 1989. By\n1990 agricultural exports had declined to less than half the level of 1978.\nThe only bright spot was the production of nontraditional export crops such as\nsesame, tobacco, and African palm oil.",
