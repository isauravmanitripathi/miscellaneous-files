    "text": "The economy of Germany is a highly developed social market economy. It has the\nlargest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the\nworld, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency\nexchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but it\nis among the world's top 4 since 1960. In 2025, the country accounted for\n23.7% of the Euro area economy according to the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF). Germany is a founding member of the European Union and the eurozone.\n\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally with $1.66 trillion worth of\ngoods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus\nworth $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes\naround 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%. Exports\naccounted for 50.3% of national output. The top 10 exports of Germany are\nvehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical\nequipment, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, basic metals, food products,\nand rubber and plastics. Germany is the largest manufacturing economy in\nEurope, contributing around one third of all manufacturing in Europe, which\nmakes it more resilient to global economic crises. Germany conducts applied\nresearch with practical industrial value and sees itself as a bridge between\nthe latest university insights and industry-specific product and process\nimprovements. It generates a great deal of knowledge in its own laboratories.\nAmong OECD members, Germany has a highly efficient and strong social security\nsystem, which comprises roughly 25% of GDP.\n\nGermany is rich in timber, lignite, potash, and salt. Some minor sources of\nnatural gas are being exploited in the state of Lower Saxony. Until German\nreunification, the German Democratic Republic mined for uranium in the Ore\nMountains (see also: SAG/SDAG Wismut). Energy in Germany is sourced\npredominantly by fossil fuels (30%), with wind power in second place, then\ngas, solar, biomass (wood and biofuels), and hydro. Germany is the first major\nindustrialised nation to commit to the renewable energy transition called\n_Energiewende_. Renewables produced 46% of electricity consumed in Germany (as\nof 2019). Germany has been called \"the world's first major renewable energy\neconomy\". Germany has the world's second-largest gold reserve, with over 3,000\ntonnes of gold. As of 2023, Germany spends around 3.1% of GDP, third among\nmajor economies, on research and development. It is also the world's second-\nlargest high-technology exporter and ranks in the top 10 of countries by stock\nmarket capitalization.\n\nMore than 99 percent of all German companies belong to the German\n\"_Mittelstand_ \", small and medium-sized enterprises, which are mostly family-\nowned. These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their\nsegments, labelled hidden champions. Of the world's 500 largest publicly\nlisted companies measured by revenue, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are\nheadquartered in Germany, as are 26 of Europe's 100 largest. Germany is home\nto many financial centres and economically important cities, such as Berlin,\nHamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart. Four German banks are\namong the biggest in the world. Germany is the world's top location for trade\nfairs; around two thirds of the world's leading trade fairs take place in\nGermany. Some of the largest international trade fairs and congresses are held\nin several German cities such as Hanover, Frankfurt, Cologne, Leipzig, and\nDüsseldorf.",

      "• The development of real GDP per capita in Germany since 1820 demonstrates significant economic growth over nearly two centuries.",
      "• In 1820, Germany's real GDP per capita was relatively low, reflecting the pre-industrial economic conditions of the period.",

    "text": "The Industrial Revolution in Germany got underway approximately a century\nlater than in the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, partly because Germany\nonly became a unified country in 1871.\n\n* Train factory of August Borsig in 1847\n\n* Many companies, such as steam-machine producer J. Kemna, modeled themselves on English industry.\n\n* BASF plant in Ludwigshafen, 1881\n\n* The invention of the automobile.

From 1834, tariff barriers between\nincreasing numbers of the _Kleindeutschland_ German states were\neliminated.[_citation needed_] In 1835 the first German railway linked the\nFranconian cities of Nuremberg and Fürth – it proved so successful that the\ndecade of the 1840s saw \"railway mania\" in all the German states. Between 1845\nand 1870, 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) of rail had been built and in 1850\nGermany was building its own locomotives. Over time, other German states\njoined the customs union and started linking their railroads, which began to\nconnect the corners of Germany. The growth of free trade and a rail system\nacross Germany intensified economic development which opened up new markets\nfor local products, created a pool of middle managers,[_clarification needed_]\nincreased the demand for engineers, architects, and skilled machinists, and\nstimulated investments in coal and iron.\n\nAnother factor that propelled German industry forward was the unification of\nthe monetary system, made possible in part by political unification. The\nDeutsche Mark, a new monetary coinage system backed by gold, was introduced in\n1871. However, this system did not fully come into use as silver coins\nretained their value until 1907.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe victory of Prussia and her allies over Napoleon III of France in the\nFranco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 marked the end of French hegemony in Europe\nand resulted in the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871. The\nestablishment of the empire inherently presented Europe with the reality of a\nnew populous and industrialising polity possessing a considerable, and\nundeniably increasing, economic and diplomatic presence. The influence of\nFrench economic principles produced important institutional reforms in\nGermany, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large\nlanded estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and\nthe introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nonetheless,\npolitical decisions about the economy of the empire were still largely\ncontrolled by a coalition of \"rye and iron\", that is the Prussian Junker\nlandowners of the east and the Ruhr heavy industry of the west.\n\nRegarding politics and society, between 1881 and 1889 Chancellor Otto von\nBismarck promoted laws that provided social insurance and improved working\nconditions. He instituted the world's first welfare state. Germany was the\nfirst to introduce social insurance programmes including universal healthcare,\ncompulsory education, sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability\ninsurance, and a retirement pension. Moreover, the government's universal\neducation policy bore fruit with Germany achieving[_when?_] the highest\nliteracy rate in the world – 99% – education levels that provided the nation\nwith more people good at handling numbers, more engineers, chemists,\nopticians, skilled workers for its factories, skilled managers, knowledgeable\nfarmers, and skilled military personnel.\n\nBy 1900, Germany surpassed Britain in steel production and became the largest\nproducer behind only the United States. The German economic miracle was also\nintensified by unprecedented population growth from 35 million in 1850 to 67\nmillion in 1913. From 1895 to 1907, the number of workers engaged in machine\nbuilding doubled from half a million to well over a million. Only 40 percent\nof Germans lived in rural areas by 1910, a drop from 67% at the birth of the\nEmpire. Industry accounted for 60 percent of the gross national product in\n1913. The German chemical industry became the most advanced in the world, and\nby 1914 the country was producing half the world's electrical equipment.\n\nThe rapid advance to industrial maturity led to a drastic shift in Germany's\neconomic situation – from a rural economy into a major exporter of finished\ngoods. The ratio of the finished product to total exports jumped from 38% in\n1872 to 63% in 1912. By 1913 Germany had come to dominate all the European\nmarkets. By 1914 Germany had become one of the biggest exporters in the world.",

    "text": "As of 2013[update], Germany is the third-largest exporter and third-largest\nimporter in the world, producing the largest trade surplus as a national\neconomy.\n\nThe German economy practically stagnated in the beginning of the 2000s. The\nworst growth figures were achieved in 2002 (+1.4%), in 2003 (+1.0%), and in\n2005 (+1.4%). Unemployment was also chronically high. Due to these problems,\ntogether with Germany's aging population, the welfare system came under\nconsiderable strain. This led the government to push through a wide-ranging\nprogramme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market\nreforms known as Hartz I - IV.\n\nIn the later part of the first decade of 2000, the world economy experienced\nhigh growth, from which Germany as a leading exporter also profited. Some\ncredit the Hartz reforms with achieving high growth and declining unemployment\nbut others contend that they resulted in a massive decrease in standards of\nliving and that its effects are limited and temporary.\n\nThe nominal GDP of Germany contracted in the second and third quarters of\n2008, putting the country in a technical recession following a global and\nEuropean recession cycle. German industrial output dropped to 3.6% in\nSeptember vis-à-vis August. In January 2009 the German government under Angela\nMerkel approved a €50 billion ($70 billion) economic stimulus plan to protect\nseveral sectors from a downturn and a subsequent rise in unemployment rates.\nGermany exited the recession in the second and third quarters of 2009, mostly\ndue to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - primarily from outside\nthe eurozone - and relatively steady consumer demand.\n\nGermany is a founding member of the EU, the G8, and the G20, and was the\nworld's largest exporter from 2003 to 2008. In 2011 it remained the third\nlargest exporter and third largest importer. Most of the country's exports are\nin engineering, especially machinery, automobiles, chemical goods, and metals.\nGermany is a leading producer of wind turbines and solar-power technology.\nAnnual trade fairs and congresses are held in cities throughout Germany. 2011\nwas a record-breaking year for the German economy. German companies exported\ngoods worth over €1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), the highest figure in history.\nThe number of people in work has risen to 41.6 million, the highest recorded\nfigure.\n\nThrough 2012, Germany's economy continued to be stronger relative to local\nneighbouring nations. In 2023, Germany experienced economic difficulties as a\nresult of the closure of Russian natural gas resources due to international\nsanctions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany imported 55% of\nits gas from Russia at the time when Russia started the invasion in 2022. Amid\na global energy crisis, Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to weaken dependence\non Russian energy imports by halting certification of Nord Stream 2, while\nalso committing to his long-term predecessor Angela Merkel's policy of phasing\nout nuclear energy.\n\nAs of December 2023, Germany is the third largest economy in nominal terms in\nthe world after the United States and China, and the largest economy in\nEurope. It is the third largest export nation in the world.\n\nIn April 2024, a report by the German Economic Institute revealed that despite\nattempts to expand into other markets, the German economy remains heavily\nreliant on China for various products and raw materials.\n\nDuring 2024, the German economy experienced its second consecutive year of\ncontraction. Europe's largest economy declined by 0.2% over the year,\nfollowing a 0.3% contraction in 2023. Germany's trade surplus with the United\nStates, reported by Reuters to have reached a record €65 billion (£54.7\nbillion) during the first 11 months of 2024, has made the nation a likely\ntarget for potential tariffs from Donald Trump's administration. The economic\nclimate has also been affected by widespread layoffs across major German\ncorporations. Companies such as Siemens, Bosch, Thyssenkrupp, and Deutsche\nBahn, all featured in the Fortune 500, are estimated to have collectively cut\nover 60,000 jobs during the first 10 months of 2024. Bosch, a highly regarded\nmanufacturing firm, announced in November alone plans to reduce its workforce\nby approximately 7,000 employees.",

The stock exchange is located in Frankfurt am Main, the\nlargest Media company (Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA) is headquartered in\nGütersloh; the largest car manufacturers are in Wolfsburg (Volkswagen),\nStuttgart (Mercedes-Benz and Porsche), and Munich (Audi and BMW).\n\nGermany is an advocate of closer European economic and political integration.\nIts commercial policies are increasingly determined by agreements among\nEuropean Union (EU) members and EU single market legislation. Germany\nintroduced the common European currency, the euro on 1 January 1999. Its\nmonetary policy is set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.\n\nThe southern states (\"_Bundesländer_ \"), especially Bayern, Baden-Württemberg,\nand Hessen, are economically stronger than the northern states. One of\nGermany's traditionally strongest (and at the same time oldest) economic\nregions is the Ruhr area in the west, between Duisburg and Dortmund. 27 of the\ncountry's 100 largest companies are located there. In recent years, however,\nthe area, whose economy is based on natural resources and heavy industry, has\nseen a substantial rise in unemployment (2010: 8.7%).\n\nThe economy of Bayern and Baden-Württemberg, the states with the lowest number\nof unemployed people (2018: 2.7%, 3.1%), on the other hand, is based on high-\nvalue products. Important sectors are automobiles, electronics, aerospace, and\nbiomedicine, among others. Baden-Württemberg is an industrial centre\nespecially for the automobile and machine-building industry and the home of\nbrands like Mercedes-Benz (Daimler), Porsche and Bosch.\n\nWith the reunification on 3 October 1990, Germany began the major task of\nreconciling the economic systems of the two former republics. Interventionist\neconomic planning ensured gradual development in eastern Germany up to the\nlevel of former West Germany, but the standard of living and annual income\nremains significantly higher in western German states. The modernisation and\nintegration of the eastern German economy continues to be a long-term process\nscheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east\namounting to roughly $80 billion. The overall unemployment rate has\nconsistently fallen since 2005 and reached a 20-year low in 2012. The country\nin July 2014 began legislating to introduce a federally mandated minimum wage\nwhich would come into effect on 1 January 2015.[_needs update_]\n\nOn 25 May 2023, a declaration of a recession in the German economy was made.\nIt was reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had contracted by 0.3%\nbetween January and March. This contraction was largely due to increased\nprices which discouraged consumer spending. The statistics office in Germany\nreported that household spending had dropped by 1.2% in the first quarter of\nthe year."

Germany is the EU´s second-largest agriculture\ngoods exporter and the fourth-largest worldwide\n\nIn 2010 agriculture, forestry, and mining accounted for only 0.9% of Germany's\ngross domestic product (GDP) and employed only 2.4% of the population, down\nfrom 4% in 1991. Agriculture is extremely productive, and Germany can cover\n90% of its nutritional needs with domestic production. Germany is the third-\nlargest agricultural producer in the European Union after France and Italy.\nGermany's principal agricultural products are potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar\nbeets, fruit, and cabbages.\n\nDespite the country's high level of industrialisation, almost one-third of its\nterritory is covered by forest. The forestry industry provides for about two-\nthirds of domestic consumption of wood and wood products, so Germany is a net\nimporter of these items.\n\nStrip mining lignite at Tagebau Garzweiler near Grevenbroich, Germany\n\nThe German soil is relatively poor in raw materials. Only lignite (brown coal)\nand potash salt (_Kalisalz_) are available in significant quantities. However,\nthe former GDR's Wismut mining company produced a total of 230,400 tonnes of\nuranium between 1947 and 1990 and made East Germany the fourth-largest\nproducer of uranium ore worldwide (largest in USSR's sphere of control) at the\ntime. Oil, natural gas, and other resources are, for the most part, imported\nfrom other countries.\n\nPotash salt is mined in the centre of the country (Niedersachsen, Sachsen-\nAnhalt, and Thüringen). The most important producer is K+S (formerly Kali und\nSalz AG).\n\nGermany's bituminous coal deposits were created more than 300 million years\nago from swamps which extended from the present-day South England, over the\nRuhr area to Poland. Lignite deposits developed similarly, but during a later\nperiod, about 66 million years ago. Because the wood is not yet completely\ntransformed into coal, brown coal contains less energy than bituminous coal.\n\nLignite is extracted in the extreme western and eastern parts of the country,\nmainly in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Sachsen, and Brandenburg. Considerable amounts\nare burned in coal plants near the mining areas, to produce electricity.\nTransporting lignite over far distances is not economically feasible,\ntherefore the plants are located practically next to the extraction sites.\nBituminous coal is mined in Nordrhein-Westfalen and Saarland. Most power\nplants burning bituminous coal operate on imported material, therefore the\nplants are located not only near to the mining sites, but throughout the\ncountry.\n\nIn 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of selenium, the\nworld's 5th largest producer of potash, the world's 5th largest producer of\nboron, the world's 7th largest producer of lime, the world's 13th largest\nproducer of fluorspar, the world's 14th largest producer of feldspar, the\nworld's 17th largest producer of graphite, the world's 18th largest producer\nof sulfur, in addition to being the 4th largest world producer of salt."

In the same year, Germany was Europe's\nlargest consumer of electricity, totaling 512.9 terawatt-hours. Government\npolicy promotes energy conservation and the development of renewable energy\nsources, such as solar, wind, biomass, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy.\nAs a result of energy-saving measures, energy efficiency has been improving\nsince the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting\nhalf the country's energy demands from renewable sources by 2050. Renewable\nenergy also plays an increasing role in the labour market: Almost 700,000\npeople are employed in the energy sector. About 50 percent of them work with\nrenewable energies.\n\nThe largest solar power and third-largest wind power capacity in the world is\ninstalled in Germany.\n\nIn 2000, the red-green coalition under Chancellor Schröder and the German\nnuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021.\nThe conservative coalition under Chancellor Merkel reversed this decision in\nJanuary 2010, electing to keep plants open. The nuclear disaster of the\nJapanese nuclear plant Fukushima in March 2011 however, changed the political\nclimate fundamentally: Older nuclear plants have been shut down. Germany is\nseeking to have wind, solar, biogas, and other renewable energy sources play a\nbigger role, as the country looks to completely phase out nuclear power by\n2022 and coal-fired power plants by 2038. Renewable energy yet still plays a\nmore modest role in energy consumption, though German solar and wind power\nindustries play a leading role worldwide. Germany has been called \"the world's\nfirst major renewable energy economy\".\n\nIn 2009, Germany's total energy consumption (not just electricity) came from\nthe following sources: oil 34.6%, natural gas 21.7%, lignite 11.4%, bituminous\ncoal 11.1%, nuclear power 11.0%, hydro and wind power 1.5%, others 9.0%.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy comprised 56%\nof the total electricity fed into Germany's grid in the first half of 2021.\nCoal was the leader out of the conventional energy sources, comprising over\n27% of Germany's electricity. Wind power's contribution to the electric grid\nwas 22%.\n\nThere are 3 major entry points for oil pipelines: in the northeast (the\nDruzhba pipeline, coming from Gdańsk), west (coming from Rotterdam) and\nsoutheast (coming from Nelahozeves). The oil pipelines of Germany do not\nconstitute a proper network, and sometimes only connect two different\nlocations. Major oil refineries are located in or near the following cities:\nSchwedt, Spergau, Vohburg, Burghausen, Karlsruhe, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen,\nLingen, Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, and Heide.\n\nGermany's network of natural gas pipelines, on the other hand, is dense and\nwell-connected. Imported pipeline gas comes mostly from Russia, the\nNetherlands, and the United Kingdom."

This is reflected in its dense and modern transportation networks. The\nextensive motorway (_Autobahn_) network ranks worldwide third largest in its\ntotal length and features a lack of blanket speed limits on the majority of\nroutes.\n\nGermany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains. The\nIntercity Express or _ICE_ is the most advanced service category of the\nDeutsche Bahn and serves major German cities as well as destinations in\nneighbouring countries. The train maximum speed varies between 200 km/h and\n320 km/h (125-200 mph). Connections are offered at either 30-minute, hourly,\nor two-hourly intervals. German railways are heavily subsidised, receiving\n€17.0 billion in 2014.\n\nThe largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, both are\nglobal hubs of Lufthansa. Other major airports are Berlin Brandenburg Airport,\nDüsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne/Bonn, and Stuttgart."

The\nUnited States is Germany’s largest trading partner, and Habeck said Trump’s\ntariffs were going to hit the German economy harder than other nations because\nit is so reliant on exports."

    "text": "As a highly industrial, urbanized economy with a relatively short coastline\ncompared to other major economies, the effects of climate change on Germany\nare more narrowly focused than other major economies. Germany's traditional\nindustrial regions are typically the most vulnerable to climate change. These\nare mostly located in the provinces of North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland,\nRhineland-Palatinate, Thuringia, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and the free\ncities of Bremen and Hamburg.\n\nThe Rhineland is historically a heavily industrial and population-dense area\nwhich includes the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland Palatinate, and\nSaarland. This region is rich in iron and coal deposits and supports one of\nEurope's largest coal industries. In the past, sulfuric acid emissions from\nRhineland coal plants contributed to acid rain, damaging forests in other\nregions like Hesse, Thuringia, and Saxony.\n\nOther significant problems for the Rhineland related to its high level of\nindustrialization include the destruction of infrastructure from extreme\nweather events, loss of water for industrial purposes, and fluctuation of the\nground water level. Since these problems are related to its level of\nindustrialization, cities within other regions are also sensitive to these\nchallenges including Munich and Bremen."
