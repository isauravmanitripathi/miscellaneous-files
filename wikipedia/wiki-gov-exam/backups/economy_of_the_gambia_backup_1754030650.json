    "text": "The **economy of the Gambia** is heavily reliant on agriculture. The Gambia\nhas a mixed economy with a heavy reliance on agriculture, combined with\nrelatively weak centralized economic planning and government regulation.\nBefore 2017 the Gambia had a under Yahya Jammeh liberal, market-based economy\ncharacterised by traditional subsistence agriculture, a historic reliance on\ngroundnuts (peanuts) for export earnings, a re-export trade built up around\nits ocean port, low import duties, minimal administrative procedures, a\nfluctuating exchange rate with no exchange controls, and a significant tourism\nindustry. The Gambia also has no significant mineral or other natural\nresources, and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population\ndepends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing\nactivity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and animal hides.\n\nShort-run economic progress remains highly dependent on foreign aid, and on\nresponsible government economic management as forwarded by International\nMonetary Fund technical help and advice.",

    "text": "Current GDP per capita Archived 2012-05-04 at the Wayback Machine of the\nGambia registered a peak growth of 23.3% in the 1970s. Economic growth slowed\nby 8.30% in the 1980s and a further 5.20% in the 1990s.\n\nRe-export trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic activity, but\nthe 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 made Senegalese goods\nmore competitive and hurt the re-export trade. The Gambia has benefited from a\nrebound in tourism after its decline in response to the military's takeover in\nJuly 1994. Lately, Indian global health expert Dr Edmond Fernandes stated that\nGambia presents a global investment opportunity and dissected various areas of\nbusiness interests."
