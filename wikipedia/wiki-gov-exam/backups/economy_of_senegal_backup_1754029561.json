Small scale\nfishing for local markets is visible all through the country. Here fishermen\nreturn to the beach at Soumbedioun, Dakar. A Rock phosphate surface mine in\nwestern Senegal, near Taïba.\n\nThe **economy of Senegal** is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing\nand agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas,\ndespite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and\nnumerous oil discoveries recently. Senegal's economy gains most of its foreign\nexchange from fish, phosphates, groundnuts, tourism, and services. As one of\nthe dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is\nhighly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall\nand climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.\n\nDakar, the former capital of French West Africa, is also home to banks and\nother institutions which serve all of Francophone West Africa, and is a hub\nfor shipping and transport in the region.\n\nSenegal also has one of the best developed tourist industries in Africa.\nSenegal's economy depends on foreign assistance. It is a member of the World\nTrade Organization.\n\nThe main obstacles to the economic development of the country are its great\ncorruption with inefficient justice, very slow administrative formalities, and\na failing education sector."

    "text": "Since the January 1994 CFA franc devaluation, the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), the World Bank, and other multilateral and creditors have been\nsupporting the Government of Senegal's structural and sectoral adjustment\nprograms. The broad objectives of the program have been to facilitate growth\nand development by reducing the role of government in the economy, improving\npublic sector management, enhancing incentives for the private sector, and\nreducing poverty.\n\nIn January 1994, Senegal undertook a radical economic reform program at the\nbehest of the international donor community. This reform began with a 50%\ndevaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which was linked at a fixed\nrate to the French franc. Government price controls and subsidies have been\nsteadily dismantled as another economic reform.\n\nThis currency devaluation had severe social consequences, because most\nessential goods were imported. Overnight, the price of goods such as milk,\nrice, fertilizer and machinery doubled. As a result, Senegal suffered a large\nexodus, with many of the most educated people and those who could afford it\nchoosing to leave the country.\n\nAfter an economic contraction of 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important\nturnaround, thanks to the reform program, with a growth in GDP averaging over\n5% annually during 1995–2004. Annual inflation had been pushed down to the low\nsingle digits.\n\nAs a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal\nis working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff\nand a more stable monetary policy. Senegal still relies heavily upon outside\ndonor assistance, however. Under the IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries debt\nrelief program, Senegal will benefit from eradication of two-thirds of its\nbilateral, multilateral, and private sector debt, contingent on the completion\nof privatization program proposed by the government and approved by the IMF."
