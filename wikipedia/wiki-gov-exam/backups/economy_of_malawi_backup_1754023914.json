    "text": "Malawi's most important export crop is tobacco, which accounted for a third\n(30%) of export revenue in 2012. In 2000, the country was the tenth-largest\nproducer in the world. The country's heavy reliance on tobacco places a heavy\nburden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community\nincreases pressure to limit tobacco production. Malawi's dependence on tobacco\nis growing, with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues\nbetween 2007 and 2008.\n\nA Malawi tea estate\n\nThe country also relies heavily on tea, sugarcane and coffee, with these three\nplus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi's export revenue. Tea was first\nintroduced in 1878. Most of it is grown in Mulanje and Thyolo. Other crops\ninclude cotton, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats. Tobacco and sugar\nprocessing are notable secondary industries.\n\nTraditionally Malawi has been self-sufficient in its staple food, maize\n(corn), and during the 1980s it exported substantial quantities to its\ndrought-stricken neighbors. Nearly 90% of the population engages in\nsubsistence farming. Smallholder farmers produce a variety of crops, including\nmaize, beans, rice, cassava, tobacco, and groundnuts (peanuts). Financial\nwealth is generally concentrated in the hands of a small elite. Malawi's\nmanufacturing industries are situated around the city of Blantyre.\n\nLake Malawi and Lake Chilwa provide most of the fish for the region. For many\nMalawians, fish is the most important source of proteins. Dried fish is not\nonly consumed locally, but also exported to neighboring countries. Most\nfishing is done on small scale by hand. However, Maldeco Fisheries owns\nseveral commercial fishing boats and operates fish farms in the southern part\nof Lake Malawi.\n\nDried fish on Likoma Island\n\nMalawi has few exploitable mineral resources. A South-African Australian\nconsortium exploits uranium at a mine near Karonga. Coal is being extracted in\nMzimba District. Malawi's economic reliance on the export of agricultural\ncommodities renders it particularly vulnerable to external shocks such as\ndeclining terms of trade and drought. High transport costs, which can comprise\nover 30% of its total import bill, constitute a serious impediment to economic\ndevelopment and trade. Malawi must import all its fuel products. Other\nchallenges include a paucity of skilled labor, difficulty in obtaining\nexpatriate employment permits, bureaucratic red tape, corruption, and\ninadequate and deteriorating road, electricity, water, and telecommunications\ninfrastructure which hinder economic development in Malawi. However, recent\ngovernment initiatives targeting improvements in the road infrastructure,\ntogether with private sector participation in railroad and telecommunications,\nhave begun to render the investment environment more attractive.\n\nRoadside vendor in Blantyre\n\nThe following are Malawi's top 20 agricultural production values and volumes\nfor 2009.

The government faces challenges such as the\nimprovement of Malawi's educational and health facilities — particularly\nimportant because of the rising[_when?_] rates of HIV/AIDS — and environmental\nproblems including deforestation, erosion, and overworked soils.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nFormer President Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi spoke about the country's recent\nunilateral agricultural reforms at the World Economic Forum on Africa at the\nUnited Nations, September 2008."

It has been reported that this\nprogram, championed by the country's president, is radically improving\nMalawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to\nnearby countries.\n\nEconomic grievances though took a downward slide during Mutharika's second\nterm. Economic grievances were a catalyst that resulted in the 2011 economic\nprotests in Malawi in July."
