    "text": "Saudi oil reserves are the second largest in the world (after\nBrazilian–Venezuelan oil reserves), and Saudi Arabia is the world's leading\noil exporter and second-largest oil producer. Proven reserves, according to\nfigures provided by the Saudi government, are estimated to be 260 billion\nbarrels (41 km3), which is about one-quarter of the world oil reserves.\nPetroleum in Saudi Arabia is not only plentiful but also located under\npressure close to the earth's surface, which makes it less expensive and more\nprofitable to extract compared to other places. The petroleum sector accounts\nfor roughly 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of\nGDP. Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and production are largely managed by the\nstate-owned corporation Saudi Aramco.\n\nAnother 40% of the GDP comes from the private sector. An estimated 7.5 (2013)\nmillion foreigners work legally in Saudi Arabia and play a crucial role in\ndeveloping the Saudi economy, for example in the oil and service sectors. The\ngovernment has been encouraging the growth of the private sector for many\nyears to decrease the kingdom's dependence on oil and to increase employment\nopportunities for the swelling Saudi population. In recent decades, the\ngovernment started allowing private sector activity and foreign investor\nparticipation in certain sectors, such as power generation and\ntelecommunications, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. During much\nof the 2000s, high oil prices allowed the government to post budget surpluses\nand boost spending on job training and education, infrastructure development,\nand government salaries.\n\nWith its absolute monarchy, large state sector, and supply of welfare\nbenefits, the Saudi economy has been described asː\n\n> A bewildering (at least to outsiders) combination of a feudal fealty system\n> and a more modern political patronage one. At every level in every sphere of\n> activity, Saudis maneuver through life manipulating individual privileges,\n> favours, obligations, and connections. By the same token, the government\n> bureaucracy is a maze of overlapping or conflicting power centers under the\n> patronage of various royal princes with their own priorities and agendas to\n> pursue and dependents to satisfy.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF\nstaff estimates in 2022–2027).

    "text": "Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, the day the well struck oil in commercial\nquantities, becoming the first in the kingdom to do so\n\nSaudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. In 1933, the Saudi\ngovernment signed an oil concession agreement with the Standard Oil Company of\nCalifornia; five years later, commercial volumes of oil were discovered in the\nkingdom. The development of oil fields continued in Saudi Arabia, managed\nmainly by Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), a company formed by the\npartnership of Texaco and Chevron. In 1951, the first offshore field in the\nMiddle East was established by Aramco at Raʾs Al-Saffāniyyah area. By 1949,\nSaudi oil production reached 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rose rapidly to\n1 million bpd in 1954. Moreover, in 1951, Aramco started operating the Trans-\nArabian Pipeline that moved oil from the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to the\nMediterranean Sea through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, in 1981, this\nline was no longer used after a new line began operations that linked Jubail\non the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea. The new pipe contributed greatly\nto speed up oil transport. In 1960, OPEC was established, with Saudi Arabia as\none of its founding members. During the 1973 oil crisis, the price of oil rose\nfrom $3 per barrel to nearly $12, and the Saudi economy started growing\nrapidly, with GDP increasing from approximately $15 billion in 1973 to almost\n$184 billion by 1981. After gradually purchasing Aramco assets, the Saudi\ngovernment nationalized the company in 1980. In 1988, Saudi Aramco was\nestablished to take over the responsibilities of Aramco.\n\nIn 1980, the price of oil peaked, and demand started decreasing as a result of\nrecessions in industrialized nations and more efficient oil use, which\nproduced surpluses. This created a worldwide oil glut, with the price of oil\ndropping from approximately $36 per barrel in 1980 to approximately $14 by\n1986. Saudi oil production, which had increased to almost 10 million barrels\n(1,600,000 m3) per day during 1980–81, fell 80% to about 2 million barrels per\nday (320,000 m3/d) in 1985. Budgetary deficits developed, and the government\ndrew down its foreign assets. As a result of the oil glut and the pressure\nfrom declines in production, after 1985 Saudi Arabia started enforcing\nproduction quotas more harshly for the OPEC members.\n\nIn June 1993, Saudi Aramco absorbed the state marketing and refining company\n(SAMAREC), becoming the world's largest fully integrated oil company. Most\nSaudi oil is exported by tankers from oil terminals at Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah\nin the Persian Gulf.\n\nA map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013\n\nIn the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil\nrevenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income\nfell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in\n1998. Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the\nkingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed\nto be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010. Increases in oil prices in the early\n2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400\nadjusted for inflation), but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.\n\nHowever, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low\noil prices. Because of a combination of factors—the East Asian economic\ncrises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Niño, and an increase in non-\nOPEC oil production—demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by\nmore than one-third.\n\nSaudi Arabia was a key player in coordinating the successful 1999 campaign of\nOPEC and other oil-producing countries to raise the oil price to its highest\nlevel since the (Persian) Gulf War by managing petroleum supply and\nproduction. That same year, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic\nCouncil to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies to\naccelerate institutional and industrial reforms.\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005 after many\nyears of negotiations.",

    "text": "All the Saudi government's five-year plan since 1970 have called for\ndiversifying the economy beyond oil, but with marginal success.\n\nThe government has sought to allocate its petroleum income to transform its\nrelatively undeveloped, oil-based economy into a modern industrial state,\nwhile maintaining the kingdom's traditional Islamic values and customs.\nAlthough economic planners have not achieved all their goals, the economy has\nprogressed rapidly. Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most\nSaudis. However, significant population growth has strained the government's\nability to finance further improvements in the country's standard of living.\nHeavy dependence on petroleum revenue continues, but industry and agriculture\nnow account for a larger share of economic activity. The mismatch between the\njob skills of Saudi graduates and the needs of the private job market at all\nlevels remains the principal obstacle to economic diversification and\ndevelopment; about 4.6 million non-Saudis are employed in the economy.\n\nSaudi Arabia first began to diversify its economy to reduce dependency on oil\nin the 1970s as part of its first five-year development plan. Basic\npetrochemical industries using petroleum byproducts as feedstock were\ndeveloped. The fishing villages of al-Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on\nthe Red Sea were developed. However, their effect on Saudi Arabia's economic\nfortunes has been small.\n\nSaudi Arabia's first two development plans, covering the 1970s, emphasized\ninfrastructure. The results were impressive—the total length of paved highways\ntripled, power generation increased by a factor of 28, and the capacity of the\nseaports grew by a factor of 10. For the third plan (1980–85), the emphasis\nchanged. Spending on infrastructure declined, shifting instead to education,\nhealth, and social services. The share for diversifying and expanding\nproductive sectors of the economy (primary industry) did not rise as planned,\nbut the two industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu—which were built around the\nuse of the country's oil and gas to produce steel, petrochemicals, fertilizer,\nand refined oil products—were largely completed.\n\nIn the fourth plan (1985–90), the country's basic infrastructure was viewed as\nlargely complete, but education and training remained areas of concern.\nPrivate enterprise was encouraged, and foreign investment in the form of joint\nventures with Saudi public and private companies was welcomed. The private\nsector became more important, rising to 70% of non-oil GDP by 1987. While\nstill concentrated in trade and commerce, private investment increased in\nindustry, agriculture, banking, and construction companies. These private\ninvestments were supported by generous government financing and incentive\nprograms. The objective was for the private sector to have 70% to 90%\nownership in most joint venture enterprises.\n\nThe fifth plan (1990–95) emphasized consolidation of the country's defences;\nimproved and more efficient government social services; regional development;\nand, most importantly, creating greater private-sector employment\nopportunities for Saudis by reducing the number of foreign workers.\n\nThe sixth plan (1996–2000) focused on lowering the cost of government services\nwithout cutting them and sought to expand educational training programs. The\nplan called for reducing the kingdom's dependence on the petroleum sector by\ndiversifying economic activity, particularly in the private sector, with\nspecial emphasis on industry and agriculture. It also continued the effort to\n\"Saudize\" the labour force.\n\nThe seventh plan (2000–2004) focused more on economic diversification and a\ngreater role of the private sector in the Saudi economy. For 2000–04, the\ngovernment aimed at an average GDP growth rate of 3.16% each year, with\nprojected growths of 5.04% for the private sector and 4.01% for the non-oil\nsector. The government also set a target of creating 817,300 new jobs for\nSaudi nationals. By 2007, advertising expenditures had reached new peaks due\nto emphasis on value-added manufacturing.[_failed verification_]\n\nIn 2016, the main investing countries in Saudi Arabia were the US, UAE,\nFrance, Singapore, Kuwait, and Malaysia. They mainly invested in chemical\nindustry, real estate, tourism, fossil fuels, automobiles, and machinery. As\npart of its diversification, Saudi Arabia arranged major refinery contracts\nwith Chinese and other companies.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in\n2005, the overall foreign investment environment in Saudi Arabia improved\nthanks to the kingdom's stable economy, massive oil reserves, high power of\nexpenditure, developed infrastructure, reinforced finance, and banking system.\nSince then, and pursuant to its commitment to the WTO, Saudi Arabia has been\ndeveloping trade-related policies and legislations. Moreover, foreign\ninvestment has been highly encouraged by Saudi Vision 2030 and its economic\ndiversification.\n\nSince 2017, to boost the economy and decrease the country's dependency on oil,\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced multiple changes, such as\nraising the prices of gasoline and electricity, levying new taxes, and\nprioritizing Saudi workers over foreign workers. However, some government\nofficials claimed the policies were causing serious ill effects on the\neconomy. Saudi businessmen reported a decline in sales for 2018, and a few\nblamed the government.\n\nIn 2019, the _Financial Times_ reported that the plans to float state-owned\noil beneficiary Saudi Aramco were stranded between the company's attachment to\nthe oil ministry and the desire to meet international standards. However,\nEnergy Minister Khalid Al Falih has long maintained that Aramco's association\nwith the state is a \"win-win policy\" for both parties.\n\nSaudi Arabia made plans to launch six \"economic cities\" (e.g., King Abdullah\nEconomic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs. At a\ntotal construction cost of $60 billion (2013), they were \"expected to\ncontribute $150bn to the economy\". However, these cities have failed to\nattract either the population or the financial investment that the government\nclaimed they would.\n\nThe privatization program Saudi Vision 2030 is running behind schedule. Oil\nprices have doubled since the government began to consider the program in\n2015. Delay in Aramco's initial public offering further demonstrated a lack of\nurgency to privatize, even though in July 2018, the International Monetary\nFund urged accelerating the process.\n\nAccording to many reports, the Saudi government is interested in granting more\nliberties to the foreign investment system and giving a 100% allowance to\nforeign investors to work in the wholesale and retail sector in certain cases.\nThe Saudi Ministry of Commerce and Investment expected that the kingdom would\nsee an increase in the GDP per capita from US$20,700 to $33,500 by 2020.\nHowever, the GDP per capita by 2020 had stagnated at $US20,000.",
