In 2020, the\ninflation rate was -0.7% and the unemployment rate was 25.9%. While exports\nwere recorded at US$1 billion, with an import value of US$6 billion.\nContributors to the national economy is service sector (47%), wholesale and\nrepair (19%), manufacturing (12%), agriculture (7%), finance and banking (3%),\nconstruction (5%), information technology (5%) and transportation sector (2%).\n\nThis aid is crucial for supporting the Palestinian Authority and funding\npublic services and development projects. Palestinians working abroad send\nmoney back to their families in Palestine. These remittances provide a\nsignificant source of income for many households. Palestinian economy relies\nheavily on donations and international aid from various sources, including\nUNRWA, Qatar, Turkey, the European Union, and non-governmental organizations.\nContribution to the economy also comes from remittances sent by the\nPalestinian diaspora. Gazans experience additional difficulties as they are\nsubjected to a siege, with Israel controlling the movement of people and goods\nin and out of Gaza. Nonetheless, there are limited business opportunities\navailable in Gaza. Contrastingly, the West Bank provides Palestinians with\nmore diverse opportunities. Some individuals own businesses in tourism-driven\nareas such as Bethlehem and Jerusalem, as tourism serves as a significant\nsource of income. Others engage in various types of enterprises in cities like\nRamallah and Hebron, ranging from trading to construction and IT services.\nFurthermore, approximately 100,000 Palestinians find employment in Israeli\ncompanies as low-cost labor, earning significantly less than the average\nIsraeli worker.\n\nWhile trade is restricted due to political factors, Palestine does engage in\nsome export activities. Palestinian products, such as agricultural goods and\ntraditional crafts, are exported to regional and international markets.\nDespite the challenges, tourism plays a role in the Palestinian economy. The\nhistorical and cultural significance of places like Bethlehem and Jerusalem\ndraws tourists. Agriculture remains a crucial sector, with Palestinians\ncultivating crops, producing olive oil, and raising livestock. Some\nPalestinians work in various service industries, including education,\nhealthcare, and technology. Palestine hosts numerous international non-\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and humanitarian agencies, which contribute\nto the local economy and provide employment.",

Real per capita\nGDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip (WBGS) declined 36.1% between 1992 and\n1996 owing to the combined effect of falling aggregate incomes and robust\npopulation growth. The downturn in economic activity was due to Israeli\nclosure policies in response to terrorist attacks in Israel, which disrupted\npreviously established labor and commodity market relationships. The most\nserious effect was the emergence of chronic unemployment. Average unemployment\nrates in the 1980s were generally under 5%; while by the mid-1990s it had\nrisen to over 20%. After 1997, Israel's use of comprehensive closures\ndecreased and new policies were implemented.

    "text": "During the worldwide recession of the 1930s, Palestine, including its Arab\npopulation, suffered severe economic hardships. The global economic downturn\nhad an impact on the region, leading to economic decline and increased\nunemployment. However, by the end of World War II, Palestine had experienced a\nsignificant level of prosperity and was considered one of the most advanced\ncountries in the Middle East in terms of economic development. This prosperity\nwas attributed to several factors. Firstly, during the war, Palestine served\nas a center of British communications, which brought numerous benefits to the\neconomy. The region benefited from contracts in transport, military\nconstruction, and supply, as well as the establishment of a large oil refinery\nin Haifa. These activities created employment opportunities and stimulated\neconomic growth. Additionally, agricultural exports, particularly citrus\nfruit, saw a marked increase during this period. The disruption of supplies\nfrom other parts of the Mediterranean due to the war, especially the actions\nof the Germans, created a higher demand for Palestinian citrus products. This\npresented an opportunity for both Arab and Jewish citrus producers to take\nadvantage of the increased demand and contribute to the economic growth.\nAlthough many contracts awarded by the British Mandatory authorities during\nthis period went to the new Jewish immigrants, Arab Palestinians also\nbenefited from the economic opportunities. Arab Palestinians were able to\nprovide cheaper labor, which made them attractive for employment in various\nsectors. They found employment in the railroads, large military construction\nprojects, and government departments like the police.\n\nDuring the war, Palestine experienced a period of economic prosperity, which\ncoincided with new forms of investment and trade that connected the region and\nits entrepreneurs to the global market. The profits generated during this time\nwere invested in various financial instruments such as shares, government\nbonds, and commodity stocks. After the dispersion of people in 1948, some\nindividuals were able to recover a portion of their wealth through these\ninvestments. The passage suggests that data collected by the Mandatory\ngovernment provides estimates of the wealth held in Palestine during that\nperiod. According to the data, the total ownership of capital in the country\nin 1945 amounted to 281 million Palestinian pounds. Of this total,\napproximately 47 percent (132.6 million pounds) was owned by the Arab\ncommunity. The majority of this wealth (74.8 million pounds) was invested in\nrural landholdings that could not be transferred abroad. However, there were\nother assets, such as investments in foreign stocks and shares, which were in\na form that could be recovered by those who went into exile. These foreign\nliquid assets amounted to just over 39 million pounds. Additionally, Arab\nbanks in Palestine held 7 million pounds in bank deposits, and another 3\nmillion pounds were deposited in the Ottoman Bank or the local branch of\nBarclays Bank, some of which was recovered through international litigation in\nthe early 1950s.\n\nA significant portion of the bank deposits held in Arab banks in Palestine,\namounting to approximately 10 million pounds, was transferred to Jordan. This\ntransfer occurred as a result of the mass displacement of Palestinians during\nthe 1948-1949 Arab-Israeli war, with many seeking refuge in Jordan.\nFurthermore, it mentions that at least 1.5 million pounds in the form of\nbanknotes was brought into the country prior to the abolition of the\nPalestinian currency. This indicates that individuals who left Palestine took\nphysical banknotes with them as they sought refuge or migrated to other\nregions. At least 1.5 million pounds in the form of banknotes was transferred\nto Syria. Smaller amounts being sent to Egypt and Iraq. These transfers\nsuggest that some individuals who left Palestine took physical banknotes with\nthem to these countries.",

    "text": "During the 1970s and subsequent years, a considerable number of Palestinians\nsought employment opportunities in Israel. This labor integration provided\nincome and remittances, which had positive effects on the Palestinian economy.\nPalestinian workers played a significant role in various sectors of the\nIsraeli economy, such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. While\nthere were some economic benefits from labor integration, the overall economic\ndisparities between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories persisted.\nPalestinians faced limited access to resources, markets, and capital, which\nhindered their economic development.\n\nIntegration into the Israeli labor market provided Palestinians with access to\njob opportunities that were not readily available in the occupied territories.\nPalestinians found employment in various sectors, including construction,\nagriculture, manufacturing, and services. This helped alleviate unemployment\nand provided a source of income for Palestinian workers and their families.\nThe General Federation of Trade Unions, representing Palestinian workers, was\nfounded to advocate for their rights and interests.\n\nPalestinian exports peaked in 1981 followed by a decline through the 1990s. In\nthe same time period imports nearly doubled, increasing a trade deficit of 35%\nof GDP in 1981 to a deficit of 45% of GDP in 1996. The first Intifada, a\nPalestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, which took place from 1987 to\n1993, had a profound impact on the Palestinian economy. The Intifada led to\nwidespread disruptions, closures, and restrictions imposed by Israel, which\ngreatly affected economic activities and livelihoods. In 1991, the invasion of\nKuwait and resulting Gulf War affected the Palestinian economy. The Madrid\nConference, held that same year, improved economic collaboration between the\nArab countries and Israel.\n\nThe Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s, led to the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority (PA) and limited self-governance in parts of the West\nBank and Gaza. The PA took on responsibilities in areas such as trade,\ninvestment, and public services. However, the overall impact on the\nPalestinian economy was mixed, as the peace process faced setbacks and the\nIsraeli occupation persisted. In 1994, The Paris Protocol was signed,\noutlining economic relations between Israel and the PA, including provisions\nfor labor movement and employment. Next year, the Israeli government imposed\nrestrictions on the movement of Palestinian workers within Israel due to\nsecurity concerns. The PA assumed control over some economic sectors,\nincluding tourism, trade, and investment by 1995. Until 1999 the Palestinian\neconomy experienced a period of relative growth and stability with increased\ninternational aid and improved economic indicators.\n\nFor 30 years, Israel permitted thousands of Palestinians to enter the country\neach day to work in construction, agriculture and other blue-collar jobs.\nDuring this period, the Palestinian economy was significantly greater than the\nmajority of Arab states. Until the mid-1990s, up to 150,000 people—about a\nfifth of the Palestinian labor force—entered Israel each day. After\nPalestinians unleashed a wave of suicide bombings, the idea of separation from\nthe Palestinians took root in Israel. Israel found itself starved for labor,\nand gradually replaced most of the Palestinians with migrants from Thailand,\nRomania and elsewhere."

    "text": "In 2005, the PNA Ministry of Finance cited the Israeli West Bank barrier,\nwhose construction began in the second half of 2002, as one reason for the\ndepressed Palestinian economic activity. Real GDP growth in the West Bank\ndeclined substantially in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and increased modestly in 2003\nand 2004. The World Bank attributed the modest economic growth since 2003 to\n\"diminished levels of violence, fewer curfews, and more predictable (albeit\nstill intense) closures, as well as adaptation by Palestinian business to the\ncontours of a constrained West Bank economy\". Under a \"disengagement scenario\"\nthe Bank predicted a real growth rate of −0.2% in 2006 and −0.6% in 2007.\n\nIn the wake of Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza, there were\nshortages of bread and basic supplies due to closure of the al Mentar/Karni\nborder-crossing into Israel. Israel's offer to open other crossings was turned\ndown by the Hamas-run Palestinian authority.\n\nFollowing the January 2006 legislative elections, decisively won by Hamas, the\nQuartet (apart from Russia) cut all funds to the Palestinian Authority led by\nprime minister Ismail Haniyah (Hamas). The PA had a monthly cash deficit of\n$60 million-$70 million after it received $50 million – $55 million a month\nfrom Israel in taxes and customs duties collected by Israeli officials at the\nborders. After the elections, the Palestinian stock market fell about 20%, and\nthe PA exhausted its borrowing capacity with local banks. Israel ceased\ntransferring $55 million in tax receipts to the PA. These funds accounted for\na third of the PA's budget and paid the wages of 160,000 Palestinian civil\nservants (among them 60,000 security and police officers). The United States\nand the European Union halted direct aid to the PA, while the US imposed a\nfinancial blockade on PA's banks, impeding the transfer of some of the Arab\nLeague's funds (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Qatar). In May 2006, hundreds of\nPalestinians demonstrated in Gaza and the West Bank demanding payment of their\nwages. Tension between Hamas and Fatah rose as a result of this \"economic\nsqueeze\" on the PA.\n\nIn 2009, the Israeli military removed its checkpoint at the entrance of Jenin\nin a series of reductions in security measures. In September 2012, EU\nactivists stated that the Palestinian economy \"lost access to 40% of the West\nBank, 82% of its groundwater and more than two-thirds of its grazing land\" due\nto the occupation and settlement construction.\n\nThe first planned Palestinian city named Rawabi is under construction north of\nRamallah, with the help of funds from Qatar. In 2013, commercial trade between\nIsrael and the Palestinian territories was valued at US$20 billion annually."

According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the\nagricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally\nemploys 90% of the population. Around 183,000 hectares of land in the\nPalestinian territories are cultivated, of which around half is used for olive\nproduction. Olive products earn more in export income than any other\nagricultural crop.\n\nOver the past 10 years, unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the\nagricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine.\n\nPalestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems, blockades to\nexportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread\nconfiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use,\nconfiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West\nBank. Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between\nIsrael and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine."

The Palestinian IT sector grew from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in\n2010. The industry has seen a 64% increase in foreign business since 2009. The\nmajority of Palestinian IT companies are concerted in the city of Ramallah\nnorth of Jerusalem.\n\nSince 2010, Israeli high-tech companies have begun to employ Palestinian\nengineers. To date, most of them are outsourced workers, but Mellanox, a\ncomputer hardware firm, plans to hire 15–20 Palestinian engineers as regular\nemployees. Joint economic cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians\nofficials has experienced growth over the past years. Starting in 2008, Cisco\nSystems began a concerted effort to jump-start the nascent Palestinian IT\nsector with a holistic ecosystem approach, encompassing venture capital,\nprivate equity, capacity building and direct outsourcing to Palestinian\ncompanies. The company invested $15 million toward that end and drew in other\nmajor international investors and donors, including Microsoft, HP and Google.\nThe Palestinian IT sector has since grown from 0.8% of GDP in 2008 to 5% in\n2010.\n\nIn May 2018, the World Bank published a major report into the Palestinian\ntechnology sector entitled, \"Tech startup ecosystem in West Bank and Gaza.\"\nAccording to the report, as of early 2017, there were 241 active tech start-\nups in Palestinian Territories, which has created a total of 1,247 jobs. The\nreport also recorded 51 active investors in Palestinian tech companies (around\n75 percent angel investors and 25 percent venture capital firms). Among the\nmajor VC firms listed are Sadara Ventures, Ibtikar Fund and Oasis500. Venture\ncapital firms reported having invested just under US$150 million in over 40\nPalestinian tech companies by 2017.

There is essentially no tourist flow to Gaza\nsince 2005 because of the ongoing Israeli military land, air, and sea\nblockade.\n\nIn 2013 Palestinian Authority Tourism minister Rula Ma'ay'a stated that her\ngovernment aims to encourage international visits to Palestine, but the\noccupation is the main factor preventing the tourism sector from becoming a\nmajor income source to Palestinians. There are no visa conditions imposed on\nforeign nationals other than those imposed by the visa policy of Israel.\nAccess to Jerusalem and the West Bank is controlled by the Government of\nIsrael and access to Gaza is controlled by Hamas. Entry to the occupied\nPalestinian territories requires only a valid international passport but entry\nto Israel may be denied for Palestinians or Arabic visitors. In October 2009,\na new project got underway promoting tourism and travel between the two areas.\nNew business efforts and tourist attractions have been initiated in Jenin.\n\nA large number of international brands operates their hotels in the\nPalestinian territories of both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. These\ninclude Intercontinental Jacir Palace, Seven Arches Hotel Intercontinental,\nMarriott Gaza (later Al-Mashtal) and Millennium Palestine Ramallah Hotel. In\n1995, Marriott International proposed to construct a business center-cum-\nluxury hotel in Gaza. The project was later changed to another hotel, in the\nsame city."

    "text": "The presence of oil and gas reserves in Palestine has become a contentious\nissue, with some advocates suggesting that these fossil fuel resources are\ninfluencing Israel's attacks on the region. According to a 2019 U.N. report,\nit is estimated that over 3 billion barrels of oil exist off the coast and\nbeneath the occupied lands of Palestine. Additionally, the Levant Basin in the\nMediterranean is believed to hold around 1.7 billion barrels of oil, with\nanother 1.5 billion barrels estimated to lie beneath the occupied West Bank\narea. However, under Israeli occupation, Palestinians are not allowed to drill\nfor oil and gas or develop their independent energy systems, including solar\nenergy. Meanwhile, Israel has been actively claiming these resources for\nitself, approving licenses for companies to explore for more offshore gas\nfields. The Israeli government is also interested in building a pipeline to\nexport gas to European nations, particularly as Europe seeks alternative\nenergy providers due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nMany advocates argue that foreign interests in extracting these resources from\nPalestinian lands are contributing to the potential genocide faced by\nPalestinians. Throughout history, foreign policy in the Middle East has often\nrevolved around fossil fuels, and this situation seems no different. The\nstruggle between Israelis and Palestinians dates back to colonial times, with\ntensions and conflicts fueled by the desire for community, safety, and control\nof the land. The discovery of oil in the region further complicated the\nsituation, as world powers sought to secure access to this crucial commodity.\nThe intertwined history of oil and the creation of modern Middle Eastern\nstates makes it difficult to separate conflicts in the region from the\ninfluence of oil and gas resources. The presence of billions of barrels of oil\nin Palestine, combined with the geopolitical interests of various actors, adds\nanother layer of complexity to the Israel–Palestine conflict. When it comes to\nthe presence of oil and gas reserves in Palestine, there is an ongoing\nconflict between Israel and Palestine over the ownership and exploitation of\nthese resources. In 1999, a gas field was discovered about 20 miles off the\ncoast of Gaza. However, negotiations between Israel and Palestine to divide\nthese resources were disrupted by the Second Intifada, or Palestinian\nuprisings, which began in 2000.\n\nUnder international law, the oil and gas resources in Palestine should belong\nto the occupied territory and not the occupying power (Israel). However,\nIsrael has been benefiting from the oil and gas reserves beneath Palestinian\nlands and waters. Palestine has been unable to access these resources,\nresulting in a loss of billions of dollars of economic potential. Moreover,\nthere are concerns about the environmental impact of fossil fuel extraction,\nand Palestinian activists are pushing for a focus on renewable energy instead.\nThe international community's complicity in the ongoing Israeli occupation and\nthe conflict in Gaza is seen by some as intricately tied to capitalist\ninterests and the pursuit of profit. The history of colonialism and the\nextraction of oil resources in the Middle East is seen as part of the wider\ncontext of the Israel-Palestine conflict. While some argue that fossil fuels\nhave a marginal role in the conflict, others believe that religious ideology,\ngeopolitical strategies, and access to trading routes play a bigger role.\nOverall, the conflict in Palestine and the pursuit of oil and gas resources\nhave deep historical and geopolitical roots that contribute to the ongoing\ntensions in the region.\n\nPalestine holds massive potential reserves of oil and gas. Over 3 billion\nbarrels (480,000,000 m3) of oil are estimated to exist off the coast and\nbeneath occupied Palestinian lands. The Levant Basin holds around 1.7 billion\nbarrels (270,000,000 m3) of oil, with another 1.5 billion barrels (240,000,000\nm3) barrels beneath the occupied West Bank area. Around 2 billion barrels\n(320,000,000 m3) of oil reserves are believed to exist in shore of the Gaza\nStrip. According to a report by the UNCTAD, around 1,250 billion barrels\n(1.99×1011 m3) of oil reserves are in the occupied Palestinian territory of\nthe West Bank, probably the Meged oil field. As per the Palestinian Authority,\n80% of this oil field falls under the lands owned by Palestinians.\n\nMasadder, a subsidiary of the Palestine Investment Fund is developing the\noilfield in the West Bank. Block-1 field, which spans an area of 432 square\nkilometres (167 sq mi) from northwest Ramallah to Qalqilya in Palestine, has\nsignificant potential for recoverable hydrocarbon resources. It is estimated\nto have a P90 (a level of certainty) of 0.03 billion barrels (4,800,000 m3) of\nrecoverable oil and 6,000,000,000 cubic feet (170,000,000 m3). The estimated\ncost for the development of the field is $390 million, and it will be carried\nout under a production sharing agreement with the Government of Palestine.\nCurrently, an initial pre-exploration work program is underway to prepare for\ndesigning an exploration plan for approval, which will precede the full-\nfledged development of the field.\n\nNatural gas in Palestine is mostly found in Gaza Strip. Gaza Marine is a\nnatural gas field, located around 32 kilometres (20 mi) from the coast of the\nterritory in the Mediterranean shore. It holds gas reserves ranging between 28\nbillion cubic metres (990 billion cubic feet) to 32 billion cubic metres (1.1\ntrillion cubic feet). These estimates far exceed the needs of the Palestinian\nterritories in energy. The gas field was discovered by the British Gas Group\nin 1999. Upon the discovery of the gas field, it was lauded by Yasser Arafat\nas a \"Gift from God\". A regional cooperation between the Palestinian\nAuthority, Israel and Egypt were signed for developing the field and Hamas\nalso gave approval to the Palestinian Authority. However, since the ongoing\nGaza war, this project have been delayed."

According to Hanna Siniora of the\nPalestinian-American Chamber of Commerce, the turning point was 1993.

The main cause is seen\nas the political and physical barriers separating it from the rest of the West\nBank. The ACRI report attributing the problem to \"'the cumulative effects of\nannexation, neglect, rights violations and the completion of the separation\nbarrier.\" Another contributing factor to the economic decline is the housing\nsituation.

Israel blamed\nHamas for taking actions that led to the closure policy. A large part of the\npopulation is dependent on humanitarian assistance, primarily from the UN\nagencies.\n\nAn easing of Israel's closure policy in 2010 resulted in an improvement in\nsome economic indicators, but regular exports from the Gaza Strip were still\nprohibited. According to the Israeli Defense Forces, the economy improved in\n2011, with a drop in unemployment and an increase in GDP. New malls have\nopened, local industry is developing and the economic upswing has led to the\nconstruction of hotels and a rise in the import of cars. Wide-scale\ndevelopment has been made possible by the unhindered movement of goods into\nGaza through the Kerem Shalom Crossing and tunnels between the Gaza Strip and\nEgypt. The current rate of trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom is 250\ntrucks per day. This figure fluctuates depending on the level of interference\nwith goods being brought into Gaza from Egypt through tunnels. The increase in\nbuilding activity has led to a shortage of construction workers. To make up\nfor the deficit, young people are being sent to learn the trade in Turkey."
