    "text": "Bosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has\naccomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. It is an EU candidate country\nand is embarking on a new growth model after a period of slow growth and the\n2008 financial crisis. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small, open economy,\ndominated by services, which accounted for 55% of gross domestic product (GDP)\nin 2016, with a moderately developed industrial and manufacturing sector (23%\nand 12%, respectively), and a limited agricultural base (about 6% of GDP).\n\nThe konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency\nintroduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and\nthe banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however,\nhas been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level\ninstitutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks,\nprimarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A\nsizable current account deficit and a very high unemployment rate remain the\ntwo most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts\nof reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international\ncommunity but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the\nCountry Commercial Guide – an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look\nat Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using\neconomic, political, and market analysis.\n\nAccording to Serbian American economist, Branko Milanović, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina did the best job in the transition from socialism to capitalism\nwhen compared to the other republics of the former Yugoslavia. From 1985 until\n2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina performed the best on the annual average GDP\ngrowth per capita (1.6%), Slovenia (1.4%), Croatia (1%), Serbia without Kosovo\n(0.9%) and North Macedonia (0.5%).\n\nAt the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), Bosnia and\nHerzegovina was an important mineral processing centre and provided the other\nrepublics with basic mineral commodities in exchange for current consumption\ngoods. While large amounts of public capital investments poured in during the\n1970s, productivity levels remained low, often due to the limited capacity of\npublic managers. Under former republican premier Džemal Bijedić, and Yugoslav\npresident Tito, metal-product industries were promoted in the republic,\nresulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products\nplants.\n\nMerging small firms into larger agglomerates was a common practice in the SFRY\nto preserve employment levels. As a result, four large conglomerates emerged\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina over time: Energoinvest (energy sector), Unis\n(automotive and defence industry, which partnered with Volkswagen in the early\n1970s), Šipad (wood processing) and RMK Zenica (steel industry, later acquired\nby ArcelorMittal). Construction and defence were important industries in the\nBosnian economy, despite their low efficiency and, ultimately, excess supply.\nThe defence industry was particularly developed in the southern districts and\naround Mostar, which was also a relevant metallurgical centre (Aluminij\nMostar). Machinery production was concentrated in the north, particularly\naround Banja Luka. The Tuzla district was renowned for its chemical industry.\nThe automotive industry, which developed in the 1950s with the production of\nvehicle components, extended later on to passenger and commercial vehicles,\nwith plants in Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka. Agriculture was not highly\ndeveloped, despite its importance for employment and the presence of the large\nAgrokomerc conglomerate based at the north-west border with Croatia.\n\nTito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic\nsector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a\nhost of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World\nbrand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF.\nBig Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS\nSarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions\nof USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of\nincome in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly\nskilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science\nexperts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas.\nBefore the war, Yugoslav premier Ante Marković, made some preparations for\nprivatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased\ndevelopment in these actions.\n\nThe economy suffered heavily from the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with over\n€200 billion in material damages and GDP (excluding services) reduced by 90%\nbetween 1990 and 1995. Today, most of the above-mentioned companies have been\nprivatised. The economy remains fragile, primarily consumption driven and\nvulnerable to external fluctuations. This was seen with the global economic\ncrisis, which pushed Bosnia and Herzegovina into recession in 2009 and 2012\n(with GDP growth of -3% and -0.8%, respectively) and severe floods in 2014,\nwhich caused damage of approximately 15% of GDP. Since 2015, annual GDP growth\nhas increased to more than 3%. Still, the country registered a current account\ndeficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2017, decreasing from 5.3% in 2015, resulting from a\nreduction in its trade deficit, which nevertheless remains large (17.4% of GDP\nin 2017).\n\nA Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, debt\nnegotiations were held with the London Club in December 1997 and with the\nParis Club in October 1998, and a new currency, the Bosnia and Herzegovina\nconvertible mark, was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark\ngained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its\nreserve holdings. Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the\nBosnian mark to the Euro, inflation has remained low in the entire country.\n\nWith an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996–99 at high percentage\nrates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000–02. The country\nreceives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid\nfrom the international community. Support for East European Democracy (SEED)\nassistance accounts for 20%-25% of economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the\nFederation outpacing the RS.[_clarification needed_] According to World Bank\nestimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35%\nin the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the\nFederation in 1998.\n\nThe movement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in\neconomic reform since peace was re-established. Banking reform lagged, as did\nthe implementation of privatization. Many companies (mainly factories) that\nwere privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries\nand deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons\ndestroyed those factories."

Post-war high percentage of\nunemployment (16.85%) remains high, and the economical progress is very slow.\nComplicated bureaucracy system, complex procedures and often misconducted\naudition and regulation by public officers also make for volatile and insecure\nbusiness environment, which is considered major hindrance to foreign\ninvestment into the country's industrial and manufacturing potential.\n\nThe workforce is comparably cheap, with average net salary being €580, and\naverage gross salary being €891, (as of June 2022[update]) and good skilled,\nespecially in sectors present in pre-war economy. However, with slow but\npersistent know-how obsolescence, workforce exodus, high unemployment and long\naverage time outside labor market for the unemployed, need a foreign-owned\nbusiness investing in industry sectors where the country could be competitive.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is also lacking a good e-governance structure, as well\nas good methods to enforce administrative accountability, both of which are\nconsidered necessary for more conductive business climate. Today[_when?_] it\ntakes between 3–5 weeks to register a company in the country (and in some\nbusiness sectors it can still take months to acquire all required permits,\nmostly due to administrative inefficiency), and many other business related\nadministrative procedures are similarly convoluted and time-consuming.\n\nPolitical corruption is one of the more acute problems in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, and along with size of administration and its inefficiency, the\nbiggest detriment to tax money being spent where it should be spent – on\nservices to the population and the economy.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has been preparing for an era of declining\ninternational assistance. Country's most immediate task remains economic\nrevitalization to create jobs and income. After the 2014 riots, both\nadministrations have shyly started the reform, dealing with some of the many\npressing issues to local economy, but the overall process is still considered\nslow and tenuous by the populace and local as well as foreign economic\nanalysts."
