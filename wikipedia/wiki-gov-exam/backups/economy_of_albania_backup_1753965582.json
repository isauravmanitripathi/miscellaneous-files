The country has some natural resources, and the\neconomy is mainly bolstered by agriculture, food processing, lumber, oil,\ncement, chemicals, mining, basic metals, hydro power, tourism, textile\nindustry, and petroleum extraction. The strongest sectors are energy, mining,\nmetallurgy, agriculture, and tourism. Primary industrial exports are clothing\nand chrome.\n\nTourism has been a notable source of national income, particularly during the\nsummer months. With over 6.4 million tourists visiting Albania in 2019,\ntourism generates revenue in excess of $2.4 billion annually."

    "text": "GDP per capita development of Albania since 1913\n\nFollowing the collapse of the communist regime in 1990, Albania experienced a\nmass exodus of refugees to Italy and Greece. The country attempted to\ntransition to autarky, which eventually succeeded. Attempts at reform began in\nearnest in early 1993 after real GDP fell by more than 50% from its peak in\n1989. The country currently suffers from high organised crime and high\ncorruption rates.\n\nThe democratically elected government that assumed office in April 1992\nlaunched an ambitious economic reform program to halt economic deterioration\nand put the country on the path toward a market economy. Key elements included\nprice and exchange system liberalisation, fiscal consolidation, monetary\nrestraint, and a firm income policy. These were complemented by a\ncomprehensive package of structural reforms including privatisation,\nenterprise, and financial sector reform, and the creation of the legal\nframework for a market economy and private sector activity. Most agriculture,\nstate housing, and small industry were privatised. This trend continued with\nthe privatisation of transport, services, and small and medium-sized\nenterprises.\n\nIn 1995, the government began privatising large state enterprises. After\nreaching a low point in the early 1990s, the economy slowly expanded again,\nreaching its 1989 level by the end of the decade."

Mean wages were $300.83 per month in 2009.\n\nAlbania is a low-income country by Western European standards, with a GDP per\ncapita lower than all countries in the EU. According to Eurostat, Albania's\nGDP per capita (expressed in PPS – Purchasing Power Standards) stood at 35% of\nthe EU average in 2008. The unemployment rate in 2018 was 12.4%.\n\nThe results of Albania's efforts were initially encouraging. Led by the\nagricultural sector, real GDP grew by an estimated 111% in 1993, 89% in 1994,\nand more than 119% in 1995, with most of this growth in the private sector.\nAnnual inflation dropped from 25% in 1991 to zero. The Albanian currency, the\nlek, stabilised. Albania became less dependent on food aid. The speed and\nvigour of private entrepreneurial response to Albania's opening and\nliberalising was better than expected. Beginning in 1995, however, progress\nstalled, with negligible GDP growth in 1996 and a 59% contraction in 1997. A\nweakening of government resolve to maintain stabilisation policies in the\nelection year of 1996 contributed to a renewal of inflationary pressures,\nspurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 0.12%. Inflation approached 0.20%\nin 1996 and 0.50% in 1997. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early\n1997 – which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's\npopulation – triggered severe social unrest which led to more than 1,500\ndeaths, widespread destruction of property, and an 0.08% drop in GDP. The lek\ninitially lost up to half of its value during the 1997 crisis, before\nrebounding to its January 1998 level of 0.00143 to the dollar. The new\ngovernment, installed in July 1997, has taken strong measures to restore\npublic order and to revive economic activity and trade.\n\nAlbania is currently undergoing an intensive macroeconomic restructuring\nregime with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The need for\nreform is profound, encompassing all sectors of the economy. In 2000, the\noldest commercial bank, Banka Kombetare Tregtare/BKT was privatised. In 2004,\nthe largest commercial bank in Albania—then the Savings Bank of Albania—was\nprivatised and sold to Raiffeisen Bank of Austria for US$124 million.\nMacroeconomic growth has averaged around 59% over the last five years and\ninflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent\ncrime, and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the\nlarge gray economy and attracting foreign investment.\n\nThe economy is bolstered by annual remittances from abroad representing about\n15% of GDP, mostly from Albanians residing their weekends in Greece and Italy;\nthis helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector, which\naccounts for over half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is\nlimited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because\nof a lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of\nsmall, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on\nhydropower, and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to\nAlbania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new\nforeign investment. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has\nhelped diversify generation capacity, and plans to improve transmission lines\nbetween Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy\nshortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to\nimprove the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to\nsustained economic growth.\n\nReforms have been taken especially since 2005. In 2009, Albania was the only\ncountry in Europe, together with Poland, San Marino, and Liechtenstein, to\nhave economic growth; Albanian GDP real growth was 3.7%. Year after year, the\ntourism sector has gained a growing share in the country's GDP.\n\nData published as of July 2012 by the National Institute of Statistics,\nINSTAT, show the economy contracted by 0.0002% in the first quarter of the\nyear – a downturn blamed mainly on the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nThe informal sector makes up a portion of the economy, although its share\nremains unclear due to its secretive nature.\n\nAccording to Santander Bank, foreign direct investment in Albania now accounts\nfor 50% of its GDP.\n\nBank profitability in Albania has dropped significantly in the last six months\nof 2023. Most international banking groups reported lower return on assets\n(RoA) and return on equity (RoE) for Albanian operations compared to overall\ngroup operations. In the first half of the year, 100% of banks mentioned equal\nprofitability compared to group level. One-third of Albania's parent banks are\nconsidering deleveraging, but all intend to maintain or increase their level\nof activity through subsidiaries."

Inward FDI\nhas increased significantly in recent years as the government has embarked on\nan ambitious program to improve the business climate through fiscal and\nlegislative reforms. The government is focused on the simplification of\nlicensing requirements and tax codes, and it entered into a new arrangement\nwith the IMF for additional financial and technical support.\"\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's January 24, 2017 report also offered some\npositive reinforcement: \"Economic program remains on track, good progress in\nimplementing structural reforms, Bank of Albania's accommodative monetary\npolicy stance remains appropriate\". The IMF inspectors who visited Tirana\nprovided the following action plan: \"Going forward, the main priorities should\nbe: to continue expanding revenue to strengthen public finances and to ensure\ndebt sustainability, reduce NPLs to strengthen financial stability and support\ncredit recovery and advance structural reforms to improve the business\nclimate. Important progress has been made in these areas, and further efforts\nare needed to cement these gains. In this regard, strengthening tax\nadministration, broadening the tax base, and introducing a value-based\nproperty tax remain important objectives. Improved public financial management\nwill help ensure more efficient public spending and control of arrears. Rapid\nimplementation of the strategy for resolving non-performing loans is needed to\nstrengthen lending to the private sector. Structural reforms to enhance the\nbusiness environment, address infrastructure gaps, and improve labour skills\nwill be crucial to strengthen competitiveness.\""

    "text": "Albania applied for membership in the European Union in 2009. It is expected\nsuch membership would benefit Albania's economy. The country received official\ncandidate status in 2014, but was twice denied full membership. The European\nParliament warned Albanian government leaders in early 2017 that the 2017\nAlbanian parliamentary election must be \"free and fair\" before negotiations\ncould begin to admit the country into the EU. The MEPs also expressed concern\nabout the country's \"selective justice, corruption, the overall length of\njudicial proceedings and political interference in investigations and court\ncases\" but the EU Press Release expressed some optimism: \"It is important for\nAlbania to maintain today's reform momentum and we must be ready to support it\nas much as possible in this process\". In May 2019, European Commissioner\nJohannes Hahn recommended that the EU open membership talks with Albania.\n\nAlbania also needs to continue to improve its infrastructure, particularly\nhighways within its borders and connecting the country to its neighbours. Once\nthere is evidence of significant progress on this front, the country's chances\nof acceptance into the EU should improve. Discussions took place during 2015\nto secure funding to do so.\n\nBy 2016, China became one of the major investors in Albania having purchased\ndrilling rights to the oil fields of Patos-Marinzë and Kuçovë (from a Canadian\ncompany) and Tirana International Airport SHPK. China Everbright and Friedmann\nPacific Asset Management will operate the airport until 2025. As of March\n2016, China was the country's main trading partner, with 7.7% of the country's\ntotal international trade; that is far more than the trade with Greece and\nTurkey.\n\nA 2018 analysis of six key categories indicated that Albania continues to\nexperience infrastructure problems that present challenges to businesses and\nfurther economic opportunities."

Today,\nagriculture in Albania employs 47.8% of the population and about 24.31% of the\nland is used for agricultural purposes. Agriculture contributes to 18.9% of\nthe country's GDP. The main agricultural products in Albania are tobacco,\nfruits including oranges, lemons, figs, grapes, vegetables such as olives,\nwheat, maize, potatoes but also sugar beets, meat, honey, dairy products, and\ntraditional medicine and aromatic plants.\n\nAlbanian wine is characterised by its unique sweetness and indigenous\nvarieties. It has one of Europe's longest histories of viticulture. Albania\nproduced an estimated 17,500 tonnes of wine in 2009. During communism, the\nproduction area expanded to some 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres). Today's\nAlbania region was one of the few places where the vine was naturally grown\nduring the ice age. The oldest found seeds in the region are 40,000 to 60,000\nyears old. Ancient Roman writer Pliny describes Illyrian wine as \"very sweet\nor luscious\" and refers to it as \"taking the third rank among all the wines\".\nAlbanian families are traditionally known to grow grapes in their gardens for\nproducing wine and Rakia.\n\nAlbania produced in 2018:\n\n* 391 thousand tons of maize;\n* 288 thousand tons of tomato;\n* 254 thousand tons of potato;\n* 240 thousand tons of wheat;\n* 239 thousand tons of watermelon;\n* 184 thousand tons of grape;\n* 120 thousand tons of cucumber;\n* 117 thousand tons of olive;\n* 108 thousand tons of apple;\n* 100 thousand tons of onion;\n* 81 thousand tons of bell pepper;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like melon\n(41 thousand tons), plum (41 thousand tons), oat (34 thousand tons), sugar\nbeet (27 thousand tons), fig (24 thousand tons), peach (19 thousand tons) and\npear (13 thousand tons)."

Albania had around 5.1 million\nvisitors in 2017, mostly from neighbouring countries and the European Union.\n\nIn 2011, Albania was recommended as a top travel destination, by Lonely\nPlanet. In 2014, Albania was nominated number 4 global touristic destination\nby _The New York Times_. The number of tourists has increased by 200% for 2014\nas well.\n\nThe Komani Lake is a popular ferry ride in southern Europe. It is similar to\nthe Scandinavian fjord with its mountains.\n\nThe bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic and the\nIonian Sea coast. The latter has pristine beaches and is often called the\nAlbanian Riviera. The Albanian coastline has a considerable length of 360\nkilometres (220 miles), including many lagoons. The coast is known for its\nrich variety of ecosystems, such as sandy beaches, capes, coves, covered bays,\nlagoons, small gravel beaches, and sea caves. Some parts of this seaside are\nvery clean ecologically, which is a rarity in the Mediterranean area.\n\nThe increase in foreign visitors has been dramatic. Albania had only 500,000\nvisitors in 2005, while in 2012 had an estimated 4.2 million – an increase of\n740% in seven years. Several of the country's main cities are situated along\nthe seashores of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. An important gateway to the\nBalkan Peninsula, Albania's ever-growing road network provides a juncture to\nreach its neighbouring countries. Albania is in close proximity to all the\nmajor European capitals with short two- or three-hour flights that are\navailable daily. Albania is also known for its history and traditional\nculture.\n\nA report from the United States Agency for International Development (USAid)\nin October 2015 indicated that the direct contribution of tourism is becoming\na significant part of the country's gross domestic product, a full 4.8% of it\nin 2013. The total contribution to the GDP was about 17% \"including wider\neffects from investment and the supply chain\". This is expected to increase in\nthe future.

Improvements to the road infrastructure, rail,\nurban, and airport transport have all led to a vast improvement in\ntransportation. These upgrades have played a key role in supporting Albania's\neconomy, which in the past decade has come to rely heavily on the construction\nindustry.\n\nAlbania's motorway network has been extensively modernised throughout the\n2000s and part of it is still under construction. There are a total of 3 major\nmotorways in Albania: the A1, A2, and A3. When all corridors are completed,\nAlbania will have an estimated 759 kilometers of highway linking it with all\nits neighbouring countries. The Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza is\nthe main port of entry for air travellers to the country. The airport is named\nafter the Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary Mother Teresa. It has\nseen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the\nearly 1990s. Today, the Airport handles over 5.2 million passengers per year.\nIn April 2021, Kukës Airport became operational in the north, serving first\nflights only to Istanbul and Zurich. In 2022, new destinations were announced,\nincluding Vienna, Basel/Mulhouse, and Memmingen. Furthermore, Albania plans to\nbuild two other airports in the south, which will mainly serve the tourism\nindustry.\n\nThe location of Durrës makes its port the busiest in Albania and among the\nlargest in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas\n\nThe busiest and largest seaport is the Port of Durrës. As of 2014, the port\nranks as one of the largest passenger ports on the Adriatic and Ionian Sea,\nwith an annual passenger volume of approximately 1.5 million. Other seaports\ninclude Vlorë, Sarandë, and Shëngjin. The ports serve an extensive system of\nferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry\nlines to several cities in Croatia, Greece, and Italy.\n\nThe railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company\n_Hekurudha Shqiptare_ (HSH). The railway system was extensively promoted by\nthe totalitarian regime of Enver Hoxha, during which time the use of private\ntransport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime,\nthere has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. Whilst\nsome of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been\nother developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and\nDurrës) that have taken much traffic away from the railways.[_citation\nneeded_]"
