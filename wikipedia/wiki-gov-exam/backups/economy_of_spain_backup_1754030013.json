    "text": "The **economy of Spain** is a highly developed social market economy. It is\nthe world's 12th largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest in Europe (fifth\nexcluding Russia). Spain is a member of the European Union and the eurozone,\nas well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the\nWorld Trade Organization. In 2023, Spain was the 18th-largest exporter in the\nworld. Meanwhile, in 2022, Spain was the 15th-largest importer in the world.\nSpain is listed 27th in the United Nations Human Development Index and 29th in\nGDP per capita by the International Monetary Fund. Some main areas of economic\nactivity are the automotive industry, medical technology, chemicals,\nshipbuilding, tourism and the textile industry. Among OECD members, Spain has\na highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly\n23% of GDP.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, Spain's economy was also in a recession. Compared\nto the EU and US averages, the Spanish economy entered recession later, but\nstayed there longer. The boom of the 2000s was reversed, leaving over a\nquarter of Spain's workforce unemployed by 2012. In aggregate, GDP contracted\nalmost 9% during 2009–2013. In 2012, the government officially requested a\ncredit from the European Stability Mechanism to restructure its banking sector\nin the face of the crisis. The ESM approved assistance and Spain drew €41\nbillion. The ESM programme for Spain ended with the full repayment of the\ncredit drawn 18 months later.\n\nThe economic situation started improving by 2013. By then, Spain managed to\nreverse the record trade deficit which had built up during the boom years. It\nattained a trade surplus in 2013, after three decades of running a deficit. In\n2015, GDP grew by 3.2%: a rate not seen since 2007. In 2014–2015, the economy\nrecovered 85% of the GDP lost during the 2009–2013 recession. This success led\nsome analysts to refer to Spain's recovery as \"the showcase for structural\nreform efforts\". Spain's unemployment fell substantially from 2013 to 2017.\nReal unemployment is much lower, as millions work in the grey market, people\nwho count as unemployed yet perform jobs. Real Spanish GDP may be around 20%\nbigger, as it is assumed the underground economy is annually 190 billion euros\n(US$224 billion). Among high income European countries, only Italy and Greece\nare believed to have larger underground economies. Thus Spain may have higher\npurchasing power as well as a smaller gini coefficient (inequality measure),\nthan shown in official numbers.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic hit the Spanish economy with more intensity than other\ncountries, as foreign tourism accounts for 5% of GDP. In the first quarter of\n2023, it had fully recovered from the downturn, its GDP reaching pre-pandemic\nlevels. In 2023, Spain's economy grew 2.5%, bucking a downturn in the eurozone\nas a whole, and is expected to grow at 3.1% in 2024, and 2.5% in 2025.\n\nAccording to Eurostat data, in 2024 Spain reached 92% of the European Union’s\naverage GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This\nfigure reflects a continued trend of economic convergence that began in the\naftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the course of this progression, Spain\nhas surpassed countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia and South Korea,\nestablishing itself as one of the EU economies that has most significantly\nnarrowed the gap with the European core over the past five years.\n\nEvolution of Spain's nominal GDP since 2000 (in trillions of euros)",

    "text": "Real GDP per capita development Spain\n\nDuring the first decades of the twentieth century, Spain experienced an\naccelerated growth of its industrial labor force and urban population; the\neconomy became less agrarian as the process of urbanization spread after 1910.\nThe largest sector was still agriculture but saw declines, along with fishery,\nrelative to the share of active population engaged in the activity. The\nfastest growing sector at that time was services.\n\nWhen Spain joined the EEC in 1986 its GDP per capita was about 72% of the\naverage of its members.\n\nAt the second half of the 1990s, the conservative government of former prime\nminister Jose María Aznar had worked successfully to gain admission to the\ngroup of countries joining the euro in 1999. By the mid-1990s the economy had\ncommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the\nearly 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the\ngovernment debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate\nbegan to steadily decline. With the government budget in balance and inflation\nunder control Spain was admitted into the eurozone in 1999. By 2007, Spain had\nachieved a GDP per capita of 105% of European Union's average due to its own\neconomic development and the EU enlargements to 28 members, which placed it\nslightly ahead of Italy (103%). Three regions were included in the leading EU\ngroup exceeding 125% of the GDP per capita average level: the Basque Country,\nMadrid, and Navarre. According to calculations by the German newspaper _Die\nWelt_ in 2008, Spain's economy had been on course to overtake countries like\nGermany in per capita income by 2011. in October 2006, Unemployment stood at\n7.6% which compared favorably to many other European countries, and especially\nwith the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%. In the past, Spain's economy\nhad included high inflation and it has always had a large underground economy.\n\nThe turn to growth during the 1997-2007 period produced a real estate bubble\nfed by historically low interest rates, massive rates of foreign investment\n(during that period Spain had become a favorite of other European investment\nbanks) and an immense surge in immigration. At its peak in 2007, construction\nhad expanded to 15% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the country\nand 12% of total employment. During that time Spain capital inflows –including\nshort term speculative investment– financed a large trade deficit.\n\nThe downside of the real estate boom was a corresponding rise in the levels of\nprivate debt, both of households and of businesses; as prospective homeowners\nhad struggled to meet asking prices, the average level of household debt\ntripled in less than a decade. This placed especially great pressure upon\nlower to middle income groups; by 2005 the median ratio of indebtedness to\nincome had grown to 125%, due primarily to expensive boom time mortgages that\nnow often exceed the value of the property.\n\nNoticeable progress continued until early 2008, when the 2008 financial crisis\nburst Spain's property bubble.\n\nA European Commission forecast had predicted Spain would enter the world's\nlate 2000s recession by the end of 2008. At the time, Spain's Economy Minister\nwas quoted saying, \"Spain is facing its deepest recession in half a century\".\nSpain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 16% in 2009.\nThe ESADE business school predicted 20%. By 2017, Spain's GDP per capita had\nfallen back to 95% of the European Union's average.",

Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( June 2024)_\n---|---\n\nLike most economies, Spain's economy had been steadily growing, regardless of\npolitical changes e.g. when the ruling party changed in 2004. It maintained\nrobust growth during the first term of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez\nZapatero, even though problems were becoming evident. According to the\n_Financial Times_ , Spain's rapidly growing trade deficit had reached 10% of\nGDP by summer 2008, the \"loss of competitiveness against its main trading\npartners\" and as a part of the latter, inflation which had been traditionally\nhigher than its European competitors. This was especially affected by house\nprice increases of 150% from 1998 and growing private sector indebtedness\n(115%), chiefly related to the Spanish Real Estate boom and rocketing oil\nprices.\n\nIn April 2008, the Spanish government growth forecast was 2.3%, but this was\nrevised down by the Ministry of Economy to 1.6%. Studies by independent\nforecasters estimated it had actually dropped to 0.8%, below the strong 3%\nplus growth rates during 1997–2007. During Q3 of 2008 the GDP contracted for\nthe first time in 15 years.

However, commentators pointed\nout that Spain's recovery was fragile, that the public debt was growing\nquickly, troubled regional banks may need large bailouts, growth prospects\nwere poor and therefore limiting revenue, and that the central government had\nlimited control over the spending of the regional governments. Under the\nstructure of shared governmental responsibilities that has evolved since 1975,\nmuch responsibility for spending had been given back to the regions.

Labor reform did\nseem to play an important role; one piece of evidence cited was that Spain had\nstarted creating jobs at lower rates of GDP growth than before: in previous\ncycles, employment rose when growth hit 2%, this time the gain came during a\nyear when GDP had expanded by just 1.2%.\n\nGreater than expected GDP growth paved the way for further decline in\nunemployment.

By the end of 2016, Spain had recovered 1.7m of the more than 3.5m\njobs lost over the recession. By Q4 2016 Spanish unemployment had fallen to\n19%, the lowest rate in seven years.

    "text": "Spanish private commercial banks played a central role in Spain's economic\ndevelopment, benefiting from their role as the state's creditor in the 19th\ncentury, from their ability to monetize public debt, and from state-sanctioned\noligopolistic arrangements that lasted from the beginning of the 20th century\nuntil the late 1980s, when European rules forced a liberalization of the\nsector. It has been argued that the favorable treatment received by the main\nSpanish commercial banks and their close relationship to the Bank of Spain\n(_Banco de España_) following the end of the Franco regime allowed for a\npublic-private partnership to restructure the large commercial banks into two\nlarge banks (Santander and BBVA) with the purpose of preparing the private\ninstitutions for international competition and external expansion once the\nEuropean banking market was integrated in 1992 Alongside this financial\nmercantilism benefiting the commercial banking sector, Spanish regulators also\nallowed for the vast expansion of not for profit savings banks sponsored by\nregional governments who became heavily exposed to the housing mortgage and\nreal estate development sectors during the Spanish economic boom of 1999–2007.\n\nPrior to 2010, the Spanish banking system had been credited as one of the most\nsolid of all western banking systems in coping with the ongoing worldwide\nliquidity crisis, thanks to the country's conservative banking rules and\npractices. Banks were required to have high capital provisions and to demand\nvarious guarantees and securities from intending borrowers. This allowed the\nbanks, particularly the geographically and industrially diversified large\nbanks like BBVA and Santander, to weather the real estate deflation better\nthan expected. Indeed, Spain's large commercial banks have been able to\ncapitalize on their strong position to buy up distressed banking assets\nelsewhere in Europe and in the United States.\n\nNevertheless, with the unprecedented crisis of the country's real estate\nsector, smaller local savings banks (\"Cajas\"), had been delaying the\nregistering of bad loans, especially those backed by houses and land, to avoid\ndeclaring losses. In June 2009 the Spanish government set its banking bailout\nand reconstruction fund, the _Fondo de reestructuración ordenada bancaria_\n(FROB), known in English as Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring. In the event,\nState intervention of local savings banks due to default risk was less than\nfeared. On 22 May 2010, the _Banco de España_ took over \"CajaSur\", as part of\na national program to put the country's smaller banks on a firm financial\nbasis. In December 2011, the Spanish central bank, Banco de España (equivalent\nof the US Federal Reserve), forcibly took over \"Caja Mediterraneo\", also known\nas CAM, (a regional savings bank) to prevent its financial collapse.[_circular\nreference_] The international accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,\nestimated an imbalance between CAM's assets and debts of €3,500 million, not\ncounting the industrial corporation. The troubled situation reached its peak\nwith the partial nationalization of Bankia in May 2012. By then it was\nbecoming clear that the mounting real estate losses of the savings banks were\nundermining confidence in the country's government bonds, thus aggravating a\nsovereign debt crisis.\n\nIn early June 2012, Spain requested European funding of €41 billion \"to\nrecapitalize Spanish banks that need it\". It was not a sovereign bailout in\nthat the funds were used only for the restructuring of the banking sector a\nfull-fledged bailout for an economy the size of the Spanish would have reached\nten or twelve times that amount). In return for the credit line extended by\nthe EMS, there were no tax or macroeconomic conditions.\n\nAs of 2017 the cost of restructuring Spain's bankrupt savings banks was\nestimated to be €60.7 billion, of which nearly €41.8 billion was put up by the\nstate through the FROB and the rest by the banking sector. The total cost will\nnot be fully understood until those lenders still controlled by the State\n(Bankia and BMN) are newly privatized. In this regard, by early 2017 the\nSpanish government was considering a merger of both banks before privatizing\nthe combined bank to recoup an estimated 400 million euros of their bailout\ncosts. During the course of this transformation, most regional savings banks\nsuch as the CAM, Catalunya Banc, Banco de Valencia, Novagalicia Banco, Unnim\nBanc or Cajasur have since been absorbed by the bigger, more international,\nSpanish banks, which imposed better management practices.\n\nAs of 2022, Spanish banks have halved their number of branches to about 20,000\nin the decade since the 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis and the subsequent\ninternational bailout in 2012. The remaining banks have reduced retail opening\nhours and pushed online banking. A retired urologist with Parkinson's disease\ngathered more than 600,000 signatures in an online petition \"I'm Old, Not an\nIdiot\" asking banks and other institutions to serve all citizens, and not\ndiscriminate against the oldest and most vulnerable members.",

    "text": "Due to the lack of its own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil\nfuels. Besides, until the 2008 crisis, Spain's recent performance had shown an\ninflationary tendency and an inflationary gap compared to other EMU countries,\naffecting the country's overall productivity. Moreover, when Spain joined the\neurozone, it lost the recourse of resorting to competitive devaluations,\nrisking a permanent and cumulative loss of competitive due to inflation. In a\nscenario of record oil prices by the mid-2000s this meant much added pressure\nto the inflation rate. In June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high\nat 5.00%.\n\nThen, with the dramatic decrease of oil prices in the second half of 2008 plus\nthe manifest bursting of the real estate bubble, concerns quickly shifted over\nto the risk of deflation, as Spain recorded in January 2009 its lowest\ninflation rate in 40 years, followed shortly afterwards, in March 2009 by a\nnegative inflation rate for the first time since the gathering of these\nstatistics started. During the 2009−early 2016 period, apart from temporary\nminor oil shocks, the Spanish economy has generally oscillated between\nslightly negative to near-zero inflation rates. Analysts reckoned that this\nwas not synonymous with deflation, due to the fact that GDP had been growing\nsince 2014, domestic consumption had rebounded as well and, especially,\nbecause core inflation remained slightly positive.\n\nIn 2017, moderate inflation between 1-2%, still below the ECB's target,\nreturned as the impact of cheaper fuel prices faded and economic recovery took\nhold.\n\nThe global hike in prices in 2022 was less severe in Spain than it was for its\npeers, ending the year with the lowest inflation rate in the eurozone, at\n5.5%. Prices continued to evolve moderately in 2023, with a lower-than-\nexpected rate of 3.2% year-on-year announced on May 30.",
