    "text": "Change in per capita GDP of Chile, 1820–2018. Figures are inflation-adjusted\nto 2011 international dollars.\n\nAfter Spanish arrival in the 15th century Chilean economy came to revolve\naround autarchy estates called fundos and around the army that was engaged in\nthe Arauco War. During early colonial times there were gold exports to Peru\nfrom placer deposits which soon depleted. Trade restrictions and monopolies\nestablished by the Spanish crown are credited for having held back economic\ndevelopment for much of the colonial times. As effect of these restrictions\nthe country incorporated very few new crops and animal breeds after initial\nconquest. Other sectors that were held back by restrictions were the wine and\nmining industries. The Bourbon reforms in the 18th century eased many\nmonopolies and trade restrictions.\n\nIn the 1830s Chile consolidated under the ideas of Diego Portales as a stable\nstate open to foreign trade. Foreign investment in Chile grew over the 19th\ncentury. After the War of the Pacific the Chilean treasury grew by 900%. The\nLeague of Nations labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the Great\nDepression because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and\nnitrates, which were in low demand. After the Great Depression Chilean\neconomic policies changed toward import substitution industrialization and the\nProduction Development Corporation was established.\n\nUnder the influence of the Chicago Boys the Pinochet regime made of Chile a\nleading country in establishing neoliberal policies. These policies allowed\nlarge corporations to consolidate their power over the Chilean economy,\nleading to long-term economic growth. The crisis of 1982 caused the\nappointment of Hernán Büchi as minister of finance and a sharp revision of\neconomic policy. Despite a general selling of state property and contrary to\nneoliberal prescriptions, the regime retained the lucrative state owned mining\ncompany Codelco which stands for about 30% of government income.\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, during the early 1990s, Chile's\nreputation as a role model for economic reform was strengthened when the\ndemocratic government of Patricio Aylwin, who took over from the military in\n1990, deepened the economic reform initiated by the military government. The\nAylwin government departed significantly from the neoliberal doctrine of the\nChicago boys, as evidenced by higher government expenditure on social programs\nto tackle poverty and poor quality housing. Growth in real GDP averaged 8%\nfrom 1991 to 1997,[_citation needed_] but fell to half that level in 1998\nbecause of tight monetary policies (implemented to keep the current account\ndeficit in check) and lower exports due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.\nChile's economy has since recovered and has seen growth rates of 5–7% over the\npast several years.[_citation needed_]\n\nAfter a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile began to experience a\nmoderate economic downturn in 1999, brought on by unfavorable global economic\nconditions related to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The economy remained\nsluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving\n4.0% real GDP growth. The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.0%.\nReal GDP growth reached 5.7% in 2005 before falling back to 4.0% in 2006. GDP\nexpanded by 5.1% in 2007.",

The Chilean Government implemented a further\nliberalization of capital markets in 2001, and there is further pending\nlegislation proposing further liberalization. Over the last ten years, people\nwho live in Chile have enjoyed the introduction of new financial tools such as\nhome equity loans, currency futures and options, factoring, leasing, and debit\ncards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an\nincreased use of traditional instruments such as loans and credit cards.\nChile's private pension system, with assets worth roughly $70 billion at the\nend of 2006, has been an important source of investment capital for the\ncapital market. However, by 2009, it was reported that $21 billion had been\nlost from the pension system to the 2008 financial crisis."

    "text": "Chilean (blue) and average Latin American (orange) GDP per capita (1980–2017).\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, Chile's \"sound economic policies\",\nmaintained consistently since the 1980s, \"have contributed to steady economic\ngrowth in Chile and have more than halved poverty rates.\" The 1973–90 military\ngovernment sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic\ngovernments since 1990 have implemented export promotion policies and\ncontinued privatization, though at a slower pace. The government's role in the\neconomy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to\noperate copper giant Codelco and a few other enterprises such as BancoEstado.\n\nUnder the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay\n10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.\n\nAs of 2006, Chile invested 0.6% of its annual GDP in research and development\n(R&D). Even then, two-thirds of that was government spending. Beyond its\ngeneral economic and political stability, the government has also encouraged\nthe use of Chile as an \"investment platform\" for multinational corporations\nplanning to operate in the region.[_specify_] Chile's approach to foreign\ndirect investment is codified in the country's Foreign Investment Law, which\ngives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is\nreported to be simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed\naccess to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and\ncapital.\n\nFaced with the 2008 financial crisis, the government announced a $4 billion\neconomic stimulus plan to spur employment and growth, and despite the 2008\nfinancial crisis, aimed for an expansion of between 2% and 3% of GDP for 2009.\nNonetheless, economic analysts disagreed with government estimates and\npredicted economic growth at a median of 1.5 percent. According to the CIA\nWorld FactBook, the GDP contracted an estimated −1.7% in 2009.\n\nThe Chilean Government has formed a Council on Innovation and Competition,\nwhich is tasked with identifying new sectors and industries to promote. It is\nhoped that this, combined with some tax reforms to encourage domestic and\nforeign investment in research and development, will bring in additional FDI\nto new parts of the economy.\n\nAccording to The Heritage Foundation's _Index of Economic Freedom_ in 2012,\nChile has the strongest private property rights in Latin America, scoring 90\non a scale of 100.\n\nChile's AA− S&P credit rating is the highest in Latin America, while Fitch\nRatings places the country one step below, in A+.\n\nThere are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans,\nissuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American\nDepository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means\ngo to finance domestic Chilean investment. In 2006, the Government of Chile\nran a surplus of $11.3 billion, equal to almost 8% of GDP. The Government of\nChile continues to pay down its foreign debt, with public debt only 3.9% of\nGDP at the end of 2006."

    "text": "One of Chile's fiscal policy central features has been its counter-cyclical\nnature. This has been facilitated by the voluntary application since 2001 of a\nstructural balance policy based on the commitment to an announced goal of a\nmedium-term structural balance as a percentage of GDP. The structural balance\nnets out the effect of the economic cycle (including copper price volatility)\non fiscal revenues and constrains expenditures to a correspondingly consistent\nlevel. In practice, this means that expenditures rise when activity is low and\ndecrease in booms The target was of 1% of GDP between 2001 and 2007, it was\nreduced to 0.5% in 2008 and then to 0% in 2009 in the wake of the 2008\nfinancial crisis. In 2005, key elements of this voluntary policy were\nincorporated into legislation through the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law\n20,128).\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility Law also allowed for the creation of two sovereign\nwealth funds: the Pension Reserve Fund (PRF), to face increased expected old-\nage benefits liabilities, and the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund\n(ESSF), to stabilize fiscal spending by providing funds to finance fiscal\ndeficits and debt amortization. By the end of 2012, they had respective market\nvalues of US$5.883 million and US$14.998 million.\n\nThe main taxes in Chile in terms of revenue collection are the value added tax\n(45.8% of total revenues in 2012) and the income tax (41.8% of total revenues\nin 2012). The value added tax is levied on sales of goods and services\n(including imports) at a rate of 19%, with a few exemptions. The income tax\nrevenue comprises different taxes. While there is a corporate income tax of\n20% over profits from companies (called First Category Tax), the system is\nultimately designed to tax individuals. Therefore, corporate income taxes paid\nconstitute a credit towards two personal income taxes: the Global\nComplementary Tax (in the case of residents) or the Additional Tax (in the\ncase of non-residents). The Global Complementary Tax is payable by those that\nhave different sources of income, while those receiving income solely from\ndependent work are subject to the Second Category Tax. Both taxes are equally\nprogressive in statutory terms, with a top marginal rate of 40%. Income\narising from corporate activity under the Global Complementary Tax only\nbecomes payable when effectively distributed to the individual. There are also\nspecial sales taxes on alcohol and luxury goods, as well as specific taxes on\ntobacco and fuel. Other taxes include the inheritance tax and custom duties.\n\nIn 2012, general government expenditure reached 21.5% of GDP, while revenues\nwere equivalent to 22% of GDP. Gross financial debt amounted to 12.2% of GDP,\nwhile in net terms it was −6.9% of GDP, both well below OECD averages."

Inflation has followed a relatively stable trajectory since the year\n2000, remaining under 10%, despite the temporary surge of some inflationary\npressures in the year 2008. The Chilean peso's rapid appreciation against the\nU.S. dollar in recent years has helped dampen inflation. Most wage settlements\nand loans are indexed, reducing inflation's volatility.\n\nThe CBoC is granted autonomous status by Chile's National Constitution,\nproviding credibility and stability beyond the political cycle. According to\nthe Basic Constitutional Act of the Central Bank of Chile (Law 18,840), its\nmain objectives are to safeguard \"the stability of the currency and the normal\nfunctioning of internal and external payments\". To meet these objectives, the\nCBoC is enabled to use monetary and foreign exchange policy instruments, along\nwith some discretion on financial regulation. In practice, the CBoC monetary\npolicy is guided by an inflation targeting regime, while the foreign exchange\npolicy is led by a floating exchange rate and, although unusual, the bank\nreserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange markets."

Higher\neffective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar\nas a result of a system of import price bands.

During 2006, exports of goods and services totaled US$58\nbillion, an increase of 41%. This figure was somewhat distorted by the\nskyrocketing price of copper. In 2006, copper exports reached a historical\nhigh of US$33.3 billion. Imports totaled US$35 billion, an increase of 17%\ncompared to the previous year. Chile thus recorded a positive trade balance of\nUS$2.3 billion in 2006.\n\nThe main destinations for Chilean exports were the Americas (US$39 billion),\nAsia (US$27.8 billion) and Europe (US$22.2 billion). Seen as shares of Chile's\nexport markets, 42% of exports went to the Americas, 30% to Asia and 24% to\nEurope. Within Chile's diversified network of trade relationships, its most\nimportant partner remained the United States. Total trade with the U.S. was\nUS$14.8 billion in 2006. Since the U.S.–Chile Free Trade Agreement went into\neffect on 1 January 2004, U.S.–Chilean trade has increased by 154%. Internal\nGovernment of Chile figures show that even when factoring out inflation and\nthe recent high price of copper, bilateral trade between the U.S. and Chile\nhas grown over 60% since then.\n\nTotal trade with Europe also grew in 2006, expanding by 42%. The Netherlands\nand Italy were Chile's main European trading partners. Total trade with Asia\nalso grew significantly at nearly 31%. Trade with Korea and Japan grew\nsignificantly, but China remained Chile's most important trading partner in\nAsia. Chile's total trade with China reached U.S. $8.8 billion in 2006,\nrepresenting nearly 66% of the value of its trade relationship with Asia.=\n\nThe growth of exports in 2006 was mainly caused by a strong increase in sales\nto the United States, the Netherlands, and Japan. These three markets alone\naccounted for an additional US$5.5 billion worth of Chilean exports. Chilean\nexports to the United States totaled US$9.3 billion, representing a 37.7%\nincrease compared to 2005 (US$6.7 billion). Exports to the European Union were\nUS$15.4 billion, a 63.7% increase compared to 2005 (US$9.4 billion). Exports\nto Asia increased from US$15.2 billion in 2005 to US$19.7 billion in 2006, a\n29.9% increase.\n\nDuring 2006, Chile imported US$26 billion from the Americas, representing 54%\nof total imports, followed by Asia at 22%, and Europe at 16%. Mercosur members\nwere the main suppliers of imports to Chile at US$9.1 billion, followed by the\nUnited States with US$5.5 billion and the European Union with US$5.2 billion.\nFrom Asia, China was the most important exporter to Chile, with goods valued\nat US$3.6 billion. Year-on-year growth in imports was especially strong from a\nnumber of countries – Ecuador (123.9%), Thailand (72.1%), Korea (52.6%), and\nChina (36.9%).\n\nChile's overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper\nexports. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world's largest copper-producing\ncompany, with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort\nto expand nontraditional exports. The most important non-mineral exports are\nforestry and wood products, fresh fruit and processed food, fishmeal and\nseafood, and wine."

Chile conducted trade negotiations in 2007\nwith Australia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as with China to expand an\nexisting agreement beyond just trade in goods. Chile concluded FTA\nnegotiations with Australia and an expanded agreement with China in 2008. The\nmembers of the P4 (Chile, Singapore, New Zealand, and Brunei) also plan to\nconclude a chapter on finance and investment in 2008.\n\nSuccessive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing\nagreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed free trade agreements (FTA) with\nCanada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade\nagreements with Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.
