    "text": "The **economy of Azerbaijan** is highly dependent on oil and gas exports, in\nparticular since the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. The\ntransition to oil production in the late 1990s led to rapid economic growth\nover the period 1995–2014. Since 2014, GDP growth has slowed down\nsubstantially.\n\nLarge oil reserves are a major contributor to Azerbaijan's economy. Gas and\noil make up two-thirds of Azerbaijan's GDP, making it one of the top ten most\nfossil fuel-dependent economies in the world. Gas and oil make up 90% of\nAzerbaijan's export revenues and 60% of its finances.\n\nAzerbaijan's economy is characterized by corruption and inequality. The\ncountry's oil wealth has significantly strengthened the stability of Ilham\nAliyev's regime and enriched ruling elites in Azerbaijan. The country's oil\nwealth has enabled the state to host lavish international events, as well as\nengage in extensive lobbying efforts abroad.\n\nThe national currency is the Azerbaijani manat. The private sector is weak in\nAzerbaijan, as the economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises. More than\nhalf of the formal labor force works for the government in Azerbaijan."

    "text": "Oil and gas are the most prominent products of Azerbaijan's economy. More than\n$60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil sector by major international\noil companies in AIOC consortium operated by BP. Oil production under the\nfirst of these production sharing agreements (PSAs), with the Azerbaijan\nInternational Operating Company, began in November 1997 and was about 500,000\nbarrels per day in 2006. People visit petroleum spas (or \"oil spas\") to bathe\nin the local crude in Naftalan. A leading caviar producer and exporter in the\npast, Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling\nstocks of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.\n\nAzerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making\nthe transition from a command to a market economy, but its energy resources\nbrighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on\neconomic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being\nreplaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including foreign investment, is\nthe continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\nIn 1992 Azerbaijan became a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization.\nIn 2002, the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.\n\nIn 2010 Azerbaijan entered into the top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU\ncountries with €9.46 billion. In 2011, the amount of foreign investments in\nAzerbaijan was $20 billion, a 61% increase from 2010. According to Minister of\nEconomic Development of Azerbaijan, Shahin Mustafayev, in 2011, \"$15.7 billion\nwas invested in the non-oil sector, while the rest – in the oil sector\".\n\nAzerbaijani exports in 2006\n\nIn 2012, because of its economic performance after the Soviet breakup,\nAzerbaijan was predicted to become \"Tiger of Caucasus\". In 2012, Globalization\nand World Cities Research Network study ranked Baku as a Gamma-level global\ncity.\n\nIn 2015, Turkey and Azerbaijan agreed to boost mutual trade to US$15 billion\nby 2023."

Now that Western oil\ncompanies are able to tap deep-water oilfields untouched by the Soviets\nbecause of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important\nareas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven oil reserves in\nthe Caspian Basin, which Azerbaijan shares with Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and\nTurkmenistan, are comparable in size to the North Sea, although exploration is\nstill in the early stages."

In some lands, it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes,\nsugar beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and\nspirits are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry is\nconcentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga.\n\nSome portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have\nbegun to be produced locally (among them are Coca-Cola by Coca-Cola Bottlers\nLTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating\nAzerbaijan).\n\nA new program which is prepared by the European Union is aimed to supporting\nthe economic diversification of Azerbaijan."

The\nthird large mobile provider is Bakcell, which is registered as a company in an\noffshore tax haven and whose owners are unknown. Ownership of the mobile\nproviders in Azerbaijan enables the ruling Aliyev family to monitor phone\ncalls and internet activity.\n\nInvestigative reporting revealed that Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and\nhis family made more than $1 billion when state shares of mobile operators\nwere transferred to a purportedly \"local partner\" which was in reality owned\nby the Aliyev family's offshore companies.\n\nAzerbaijan has relatively expensive call rates relative to comparable\ncountries. The high prices are possibly due to consolidated control of the\nmobile market and a lack of competition.\n\nThe Azerbaijan government has stated that it wants to create a high-tech\nsector in Azerbaijan."

In recent years, Azerbaijan has also become a\npopular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism. During\nwinter, the Shahdag Winter Complex offers skiing.\n\nThe government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite\ntourist destination a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism\na major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.\nThese activities are regulated by the State Tourism Agency and the Ministry of\nCulture.
