China is the\nworld's second largest economy by nominal GDP and since 2016 has been the\nworld's largest economy when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP). China\naccounted for 19% of the global economy in 2022 in PPP terms, and around 18%\nin nominal terms in 2022. The economy consists of state-owned enterprises\n(SOEs) and mixed-ownership enterprises, as well as a large domestic private\nsector which contribute approximately 60% of the GDP, 80% of urban employment\nand 90% of new jobs; the system also consist of a high degree of openness to\nforeign businesses.\n\nChina is the world's largest manufacturing industrial economy and exporter of\ngoods. China is widely regarded as the \"powerhouse of manufacturing\", \"the\nfactory of the world\" and the world's \"manufacturing superpower\". Its\nproduction exceeds that of the nine next largest manufacturers combined.\nHowever, exports as a percentage of GDP have steadily dropped to just around\n20%, reflecting its decreasing importance to the Chinese economy.\nNevertheless, it remains the largest trading nation in the world and plays a\nprominent role in international trade. Manufacturing has been transitioning\ntoward high-tech industries such as electric vehicles, renewable energy,\ntelecommunications and IT equipment, and services has also grown as a\npercentage of GDP. China is the world's largest high technology exporter. As\nof 2021[update], the country spends around 2.43% of GDP to advance research\nand development across various sectors of the economy. It is also the world's\nfastest-growing consumer market and second-largest importer of goods. China is\nalso the world's largest consumer of numerous commodities, and accounts for\nabout half of global consumption of metals. China is a net importer of\nservices products.\n\nChina has bilateral free trade agreements with many nations and is a member of\nthe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Of the world's 500\nlargest companies, 142 are headquartered in China. It has three of the world's\ntop ten most competitive financial centers and three of the world's ten\nlargest stock exchanges (both by market capitalization and by trade volume).\nChina has the second-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $17.9\ntrillion as of 2021. China was the largest recipient of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) in the world as of 2020, receiving inflows of $163 billion.\nbut more recently, inbound FDI has fallen sharply to negative levels. It has\nthe second largest outbound FDI, at US$136.91 billion for 2019. China's\neconomic growth is slowing down in the 2020s as it deals with a range of\nchallenges from a rapidly aging population, higher youth unemployment and a\nproperty crisis.\n\nWith 791 million workers, the Chinese labor force was the world's largest as\nof 2021, according to _The World Factbook_. As of 2022[update], China was\nsecond in the world in total number of billionaires. and second in\nmillionaires with 6.2 million. China has the largest middle-class in the\nworld, with over 500 million people earning over RMB 120,000 a year. Public\nsocial expenditure in China was around 10% of GDP.",

    "text": "The global contribution to world's GDP by major economies from 1 CE to 2003 CE\naccording to Angus Maddison's estimates. Up until the 18th century, China and\nIndia were the two largest economies by GDP output. GDP per capita in China\nfrom 1000 to 2018\n\nHistorically, China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most\nof the two-millennia _Pax Sinica_ from the 1st until the 19th century. China\naccounted for around one-quarter to one-third of global GDP until the\nmid-1800s. China's share of global GDP was one-third in 1820 as the Industrial\nRevolution was beginning in Great Britain. China's GDP in 1820 was six times\nas large as Britain's, the largest economy in Europe – and almost twenty times\nthe GDP of the nascent United States.\n\nAt the end of the Chinese Civil War, the economy was devastated. As the\ndefeated Nationalists fled to Taiwan, they stripped China of liquid assets\nincluding gold, silver, and the country's dollar reserves. By the time the KMT\nwas defeated, commerce had been destroyed, the national currency rendered\nvalueless, and the economy was based on barter.\n\nThe People's Republic of China's development from one of the poorest countries\nto one of the largest economies was the quickest of any country. From 1949\nuntil the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the economy was state-led with\nmarket activity remaining underground. Economic reforms began under Deng\nXiaoping. China subsequently became the world's fastest-growing major economy,\nwith growth rates averaging 10% over 30 years. Many scholars consider the\nChinese economic model as an example of authoritarian capitalism, state\ncapitalism or party-state capitalism under the general secretaryship of Xi\nJinping.\n\nChina brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in\nhistory—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.\nBetween 1981 and 2019, the percentage of the population living in extreme\npoverty decreased from 88.1% to 0.2%. Its current account surplus increased by\na factor of 53 between 1982 and 2021, from $5.67 billion to $317 billion.\nDuring this time, China also became an industrial powerhouse, moving beyond\ninitial successes in low-wage sectors like clothing and footwear to the\nincreasingly sophisticated production of computers, pharmaceuticals, and\nautomobiles. China's factories generated $3.7 trillion real manufacturing\nvalue added, more than the US, South Korea, Germany and the UK combined.\nChina's manufacturing sector benefits from one of the world's largest domestic\nmarkets, immense manufacturing scale, and highly developed manufacturing\nsupply chains. It also has two (Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing in\nthe 2nd and 3rd spots respectively) of the global top 5 science and technology\nclusters, which is more than any other country.\n\nChina has sustained growth due to export relations, its manufacturing sector,\nand low-wage workers. China's was the only major world economy to experience\nGDP growth in 2020, when its GDP increased by 2.3%. However, it posted one of\nits worst economic performances in decades because of the COVID-19 pandemic in\n2022. In 2023, IMF predicted China to continue being one of the fastest\ngrowing major economies. China's economy is both a contributor to rising\nglobal greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions causing climate change and severely\naffected by its adverse impacts, although its per capita emissions are still\nmuch lower than developed economies such as the United States.",

    "text": "There exists disputes over reliability of official economic data. Foreign and\nsome Chinese sources have claimed that official Chinese government statistics\noverstate China's economic growth. However, several Western academics and\ninstitutions have stated that China's economic growth is higher than indicated\nby official figures. Others, such as the Economist Intelligence Unit, state\nthat while there's evidence China's GDP data is \"smoothed\", they believe that\nChina's nominal and real GDP data are broadly accurate. Still, others state\nthat reported GDP growth is irreconcilable with data coming out of China. In\n2024, the United States Department of Agriculture stopped relying on official\nChinese government data over reliability concerns. According to 2007 documents\nobtained by WikiLeaks, Liaoning Party Secretary and future Premier Li Keqiang\nsaid he is far from confident in the country's GDP estimates, calling them\n\"man-made\" and unreliable and that data releases, especially the GDP numbers,\nshould be used \"for reference only\". In its place, he developed the Li Keqiang\nindex is an alternative measurement of Chinese economic performance that uses\nthree variables he preferred.\n\nChinese provinces and cities have long been suspected of cooking their\nnumbers, with the focus on local government officials, whose performance are\noften assessed based on how well their respective economies have performed.\nLocal governments have come under increased scrutiny over economic data, with\nCCP general secretary Xi Jinping stating that economic data forgery \"not only\nhurt our judgment of the economic situation, but also seriously undermined the\nCommunist Party's ideas and truth-seeking style\".\n\n\"We do not know the true number of China’s real growth figure\", Gao Shanwen,\nchief economist at SDIC Securities and adviser to the government, said at a\nPeterson Institute event on 12 December 2024. He thought that the economy had\ngrown by about 2% annually, compared to the official 5% figure. Gao expected\nthat the economy would grow by 3–4% annually over the next several years \"but\nwe know the official number will always be around 5%\". His words reportedly\ncaused the government to ban Gao from speaking publicly. While he did not lose\nhis job, the Securities Association of China ordered brokerages and investment\nfirms to make sure that their economists \"play a positive role\"; those that do\nnot obey may be fired. In January 2025, Xi aide Cai Qi ordered propaganda\nofficials to block negative economic news.\n\nAccording to a 2019 research paper published by the Brookings Institution\nadjusting the historical GDP time series using value-added tax data, which the\nauthors said are \"highly resistant to fraud and tampering\", China's economic\ngrowth may have been overstated by 1.7 percent each year between 2008 and\n2016, meaning that the government may have been overstating the size of the\nChinese economy by 12–16 percent in 2016.\n\nSeveral Western academics and institutions have supported the claim that\nChina's economy is likely to be underestimated. A paper by the US-based\nNational Bureau of Economic Research claimed that China's economic growth may\nbe higher than what is reported by official statistics. An article by Hunter\nClarka, Maxim Pinkovskiya and Xavier Sala-i-Martin published by the Elsevier\nScience Direct in 2018 employs an innovative method of satellite-recorded\nnighttime lights, which the authors claim to be a best-unbiased predictor of\nthe economic growth in Chinese cities. The results suggest that the Chinese\neconomic growth rate is higher than the official reported data.\n\nSatellite measurements of light pollution are used by some analysts to model\nChinese economic growth and suggest growth rate numbers in Chinese official\ndata are more reliable, though are likely to be smoothed. According to an\narticle by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, China's official statistics\nare of a high quality compared to other developing, middle-income and low-\nincome countries. In 2016, China was at the 83rd percentile of middle and low-\nincome countries, up from the 38th percentile in 2004. A study by the Federal\nReserve Bank of San Francisco found that China's official GDP statistics are\n\"significantly and positively correlated\" with externally verifiable measures\nof economic activity such as import and export data from China's trade\npartners, suggesting that China's economic growth was no slower than the\nofficial figures indicated.\n\nThe Rhodium Group, an independent research think tank, has consistently\nquestioned the accuracy of China's official GDP figures. Their analysis\nsuggests that China's economic growth has been systematically overstated in\nrecent years due to structural issues and \"authority bias\" in official data.\nAccording to Rhodium's estimates, actual GDP growth in 2024 ranged between\n2.4% and 2.8%, significantly lower than the official claim of 4.8%. This\ndiscrepancy is carried beyond, China's GDP has been inflated by approximately\n3 percentage points annually since at least 2022. If these adjustments are\naccurate, the overall size of China's economy could be around 10% smaller than\nreported since their tracking has started, equating to a reduction of\napproximately $1.7 trillion in GDP.\n\nThe Rhodium Group attributes these discrepancies to several factors, including\ncollapsing real estate activity, declining local government investment, and\nweak household consumption. Their research shows that official data fails to\ncapture the severity of these challenges, which presents a misleadingly stable\ngrowth narrative. For instance, in 2024, property sector declines and\nreductions in infrastructure investment were significant, yet the official\nfigures suggested stable contributions from these sectors. Similarly,\ngovernment fiscal spending and household consumption, which Rhodium argues are\ncritical indicators of economic health, were far weaker than reported.\n\nThe study by Daniel H. Rosen and Beibei Bao, published by the Center for\nStrategic and International Studies in 2015, showed that GDP in 2008 was\nactually 13–16 percent bigger than the official data, while 2013 GDP was\naccurately at $10.5 trillion rather than the official figure at $9.5 trillion.\nAccording to a research conducted by Arvind Subramanian, a former economist at\nthe International Money Fund (IMF) and a senior fellow at the Peterson\nInstitute for International Economics, the size of the Chinese economy by\nPurchasing Power Parity in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion rather than an\nofficial estimate at $10.1 trillion by IMF, meaning that China's GDP was\nunderestimated by 47 percent.",

Yet, independent estimates suggest that\nthe true youth unemployment rate may have been significantly higher, with some\nanalysts, including a prominent Chinese professor, suggesting it could have\nreached as high as 46.5%, while others speculated it may have approached or\nexceeded 50%. Reports have also surfaced about the creation of \"fake jobs\" or\npositions that exist on paper but provide no meaningful work or income, aimed\nat artificially lowering the reported unemployment figures. These issues,\ncompounded by a slowing economy, a prolonged property market crisis, and\ninsufficient demand for skilled labor, have led many young Chinese to \"lie\nflat\" or retreat from the workforce altogether.

Most of China's financial institutions are state-owned and\ngoverned. The chief instruments of financial and fiscal control are the\nPeople's Bank of China (PBC) and the Ministry of Finance, both under the\nauthority of the State Council. The People's Bank of China replaced the\nCentral Bank of China in 1950 and gradually took over private banks. It\nfulfills many of the functions of other central and commercial banks. It\nissues the currency, controls circulation, and plays an important role in\ndisbursing budgetary expenditures. Additionally, it administers the accounts,\npayments, and receipts of government organizations and other bodies, which\nenables it to exert thorough supervision over their financial and general\nperformances in consideration of the government's economic plans.

In theory any enterprises or individuals can go to the banks to obtain\nloans outside the state plan, in practice, 75% of state bank loans go to State\nOwned Enterprises. (SOEs) Even though nearly all investment capital was\npreviously provided on a grant basis according to the state plan, policy has\nsince the start of the reform shifted to a loan basis through the various\nstate-directed financial institutions. It is estimated that, as of 2011, 14\ntrillion Yuan in loans was outstanding to local governments. Much of that\ntotal is believed by outside observers to be nonperforming. Increasing amounts\nof funds are made available through the banks for economic and commercial\npurposes. Foreign sources of capital have also increased. China has received\nloans from the World Bank and several United Nations programs, as well as from\ncountries (particularly Japan) and, to a lesser extent, commercial banks. Hong\nKong has been a major conduit of this investment, as well as a source itself.\nOn 23 February 2012, the PBC evinced its inclination to liberalize its capital\nmarkets when it circulated a telling ten-year timetable. Following on the\nheels of this development, Shenzhen banks were able to launch cross-border\nyuan remittances for individuals, a significant shift in the PBC's capital\ncontrol strictures since Chinese nationals had been previously barred from\ntransferring their yuan to overseas account.\n\nChina has four of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers\n(Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Shenzhen), more than any other country.\nChina has three of the world's ten largest stock exchanges (Shanghai, Hong\nKong and Shenzhen), both by market capitalization and by trade volume.

As of 2005,\nthe yuan was generally considered by outside observers to be undervalued by\nabout 30–40%. However, in 2017, the IMF stated that the yuan was correctly\nvalued.\n\nThe renminbi is held in a floating exchange-rate system managed primarily\nagainst the US dollar. On 21 July 2005, China revalued its currency by 2.1%\nagainst the US dollar and, since then has moved to an exchange rate system\nthat references a basket of currencies and has allowed the renminbi to\nfluctuate at a daily rate of up to half a percent.[_citation needed_]\n\nThere is a complex relationship between China's balance of trade, inflation,\nmeasured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency. Despite\nallowing the value of the yuan to \"float\", China's central bank has decisive\nability to control its value with relationship to other currencies. Inflation\nin 2007, reflecting sharply rising prices for meat and fuel, is probably\nrelated to the worldwide rise in commodities used as animal feed or as fuel.\nThus rapid rises in the value of the yuan permitted in December 2007 are\npossibly related to efforts to mitigate inflation by permitting the renminbi\nto be worth more.

A market-based \"representative\"\nexchange rate against the U.S. dollar is one of the requirements for\ndesignation of a currency as one with Special Drawing Rights (SDR) by the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), one of China's goals.

Virtually all arable land is\nused for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is\namong the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans,\npotatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish.\nMajor non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish\nChina with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural\nexports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat\nproducts, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive\ncultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total,\nbut China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United\nStates. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through\nimproved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.\n\nAccording to the government statistics issued in 2005, after a drop in the\nyield of farm crops in 2000, output has been increasing annually.\n\nProduction of wheat from 1961 to 2004 (data from FAO in 2005, y-axis:\nproduction in metric tons)\n\nAccording to the United Nations World Food Programme, in 2022, China fed\neighteen percent of the world's population with only seven percent of the\nworld's arable land.\n\nAnimal husbandry constitutes the second most important component of\nagricultural production. China is the world's leading producer of pigs,\nchickens, and eggs, and it also has sizable herds of sheep and cattle. Since\nthe mid-1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on increasing the livestock\noutput. China has a long tradition of ocean and freshwater fishing and of\naquaculture. Pond raising has always been important and has been increasingly\nemphasized to supplement coastal and inland fisheries threatened by\noverfishing and to provide such valuable export commodities as prawns. China\nis also unmatched in the size and reach of its fishing armada with anywhere\nfrom 200,000 to 800,000 boats, some as far afield as Argentina. Fueled\nprimarily by government subsidies, its growth and activities have largely gone\nunchecked.\n\nTimber transported from a woodlot in the hills of Zhangpu County, Fujian\n\nEnvironmental problems such as floods, drought, and erosion pose serious\nthreats to farming in many parts of the country. The wholesale destruction of\nforests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate,\nand forest resources are still fairly meagre. The principal forests are found\nin the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Yunnan–Guizhou\nPlateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked\nextensively, and much of the country's timber comes from Heilongjiang, Jilin,\nSichuan, and Yunnan.\n\nWestern China, comprising Tibet, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, has little\nagricultural significance except for areas of floriculture and cattle raising.\nRice, China's most important crop, is dominant in the southern provinces and\nmany of the farms here yield two harvests a year. In the north, wheat is of\nthe greatest importance, while in central China wheat and rice vie with each\nother for the top place. Millet and kaoliang (a variety of grain sorghum) are\ngrown mainly in the northeast and some central provinces, which, together with\nsome northern areas, also provide considerable quantities of barley. Most of\nthe soybean crop is derived from the north and the northeast; corn (maize) is\ngrown in the center and the north, while tea comes mainly from the warm and\nhumid hilly areas of the south. Cotton is grown extensively in the central\nprovinces, but it is also found to a lesser extent in the southeast and in the\nnorth. Tobacco comes from the center and parts of the south. Other important\ncrops are potatoes, sugar beets, and oilseeds.\n\nFish ponds near Daye, Hubei\n\nIn the past decade, the government has been encouraging agricultural\nmechanization and land consolidation to raise yields and compensate for the\nloss of rural workers who have migrated to the cities. According to statistics\nby the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the annual growth rate of\nagricultural mechanization in China is 6.4%. By 2014, the integrated\nmechanization rate had risen to nearly 60%, with the rate for wheat surpassing\n90% and that for maize approaching 80%. In addition to standard agricultural\nequipment like tractors, China's agriculture cooperatives have begun using\nhigh-tech equipment, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which are used to\nspray crops with pesticides. Good progress has been made in increasing water\nconservancy, and about half the cultivated land is under irrigation.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms were introduced. First of\nall this began with the shift of farming work to a system of household\nresponsibility and a phasing out of collectivized agriculture. Later this\nexpanded to include a gradual liberalization of price controls; fiscal\ndecentralization; massive privatization of state enterprises, thereby allowing\na wide variety of private enterprises in the services and light manufacturing;\nthe foundation of a diversified banking system (but with large amounts of\nstate control); the development of a stock market; and the opening of the\neconomy to increased foreign trade and foreign investment.",

Since 1980, China's energy production has grown dramatically, as has\nthe proportion allocated to domestic consumption. Some 80 percent of all power\nis generated from fossil fuel at thermal plants, with about 17 percent at\nhydroelectric installations; only about two percent is from nuclear energy,\nmainly from plants located in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Though China has rich\noverall energy potential, most have yet to be developed. In addition, the\ngeographical distribution of energy puts most of these resources relatively\nfar from their major industrial users. The northeast is rich in coal and oil,\nthe central part of north China has abundant coal, and the southwest has\nimmense hydroelectric potential. But the industrialized regions around\nGuangzhou and the Lower Yangtze region around Shanghai have too little energy,\nwhile there is relatively little heavy industry located near major energy\nresource areas other than in the southern part of the northeast.\n\nDue in large part to environmental concerns, China has wanted to shift China's\ncurrent energy mix from a heavy reliance on coal, which accounts for 70–75% of\nChina's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy,\nand nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five\nto ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has\nreduced coal production by over 25%. as of 2023, solar power has become\ncheaper than coal-fired power in China.\n\nSince 1993, China has been a net importer of oil, a large portion of which\ncomes from the Middle East. Imported oil accounts for 20% of the processed\ncrude in China.[_citation needed_] Net imports are expected to rise to 3.5\nmillion barrels (560,000 m3) per day by 2010.[_citation needed_] China is\ninterested in diversifying the sources of its oil imports and has invested in\noil fields around the world. China is developing oil imports from Central Asia\nand has invested in Kazakhstani oil fields. Beijing also plans to increase\nChina's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only 3% of\nChina's total energy consumption and incorporated a natural gas strategy in\nits 10th Five-Year Plan (2001–2005), with the goal of expanding gas use from a\n2% share of total energy production to 4% by 2005 (gas accounts for 25% of\nU.S. energy production).[_citation needed_]\n\nSince the early 2000s, China's clean energy sector has rapidly developed. This\ngrowth has enabled renewable energy to have an important role in China's\ninternational cooperation, including South-South cooperation in which China is\na major source of clean energy technology transfer to other developing\ncountries. As of 2023, China is the world's leading producer of solar panels\nand wind turbines.\n\nThe 11th Five-Year Program (2006–10), announced in 2005 and approved by the\nNational People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy\nconservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and\nincreased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20%\nreduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal\ntowards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy,\nand nuclear power is an important component of China's development program.\nBeijing also intends to continue to improve energy efficiency and promote the\nuse of clean coal technology. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the\nThree Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when\nfully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity\ngenerated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030.\nChina's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of\nits energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.[_citation needed_]\n\nBy 2010, rapidly rising wages and a general increase in the standard of living\nhad put increased energy use on a collision course with the need to reduce\ncarbon emissions in order to control global warming. There were diligent\nefforts to increase energy efficiency and increase use of renewable sources;\nover 1,000 inefficient power plants had been closed, but projections continued\nto show a dramatic rise in carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.\n\nHistorical annual CO2 emissions for the top six countries and confederations\n\nWhile not the largest source of historical cumulative emissions, today China\naccounts for one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. On a per capita\nbasis, China's emissions in 2019 (9 tonnes CO2-equivalent [tCO2e] per year)\nsurpass those of the European Union (7.6 tCO2e) but remain slightly below the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average (10.7\ntCO2e) and well below the United States average (17.6 tCO2e). However, the\ncarbon intensity of China's GDP—the amount of carbon used to generate a unit\nof output—remains relatively high. To avoid the long-term socioeconomic cost\nof environmental pollution in China, it has been suggested by Nicholas Stern\nand Fergus Green of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the\nEnvironment that the economy of China be shifted to more advanced industrial\ndevelopment with low carbon dioxide emissions and better allocation of\nnational resources to innovation and R&D for sustainable economic growth in\norder to reduce the impact of China's heavy industry. This is in accord with\nthe planning goals of the central government. Contrary to the publicized\ngoals, China is building a large number of coal fired power plants and it\ncarbon emissions could further increase.",

    "text": "Coal mining in Inner Mongolia\n\nChina is well endowed with mineral resources, the most important of which is\ncoal. China's mineral resources include large reserves of coal and iron ore,\nplus adequate to abundant supplies of nearly all other industrial minerals.\nAlthough coal deposits are widely scattered (some types of coal is found in\nevery province), most of the total is located in the northern part of the\ncountry. The province of Shanxi, in fact, is thought to contain about half of\nthe total; other important coal-bearing provinces include Heilongjiang,\nLiaoning, Jilin, Hebei, and Shandong. Apart from these northern provinces,\nsignificant quantities of coal are present in Sichuan, and there are some\ndeposits of importance in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou. A large\npart of the country's reserves consists of good bituminous coal, but there are\nalso large deposits of lignite. Anthracite is present in several places\n(especially Liaoning, Guizhou, and Henan), but overall, it is not very\nsignificant.\n\nTo ensure a more even distribution of coal supplies and to reduce the strain\non the less than adequate transportation network, the authorities pressed for\nthe development of a large number of small, locally run mines throughout the\ncountry. This campaign was energetically pursued after the 1960s, with the\nresult that thousands of small pits have been established, and they produce\nmore than half the country's coal. This output, however, is typically\nexpensive and is used for local consumption.

As of 2023, China manufactures\napproximately one fifth of the world's total output of industrial products.\n\nMajor industries include mining and ore processing; iron and steel; aluminium;\ncoal; machinery; armaments; textiles and apparel; petroleum; cement; chemical;\nfertilizers; food processing; automobiles and other transportation equipment\nincluding rail cars and locomotives, ships, and aircraft; consumer products\nincluding footwear, toys, and electronics; telecommunications and information\ntechnology.\n\nSince the founding of the People's Republic, industrial development has been\ngiven considerable attention; as of 2011 46% of China's national output\ncontinued to be devoted to investment; a percentage far higher than any other\nnation. Among the various industrial branches the machine-building and\nmetallurgical industries have received the highest priority. These two areas\nalone now account for about 20–30 percent of the total gross value of\nindustrial output. In these, as in most other areas of industry, however,\ninnovation has generally suffered at the hands of a system that has rewarded\nincreases in gross output rather than improvements in variety, sophistication\nand quality. China, therefore, still imports significant quantities of\nspecialized steels. Overall industrial output has grown at an average rate of\nmore than ten percent per year, having surpassed all other sectors in economic\ngrowth and degree of modernization.\n\nFollowing its 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, China quickly\ndeveloped a reputation as the \"world's factory\" through its manufacturing\nexports. The complexity of its exports increased over time, and as of 2019 it\naccounts for approximately 25% of all high tech goods produced globally.\n\nThe predominant focus of development in the chemical industry is to expand the\noutput of chemical fertilizers, plastics, and synthetic fibers. The growth of\nthis industry has placed China among the world's leading producers of\nnitrogenous fertilizers. In the consumer goods sector the main emphasis is on\ntextiles and clothing, which also form an important part of China's exports.\nTextile manufacturing, a rapidly growing proportion of which consists of\nsynthetics, account for about ten percent of the gross industrial output and\ncontinues to be important, but less so than before.

In response, the country has launched a number\nof initiatives to close the gap, including investing $150 billion into its\ndomestic IC industry, with a \"Made in China 2025\" goal of 70% domestic\nproduction.\n\nChina leads the world in terms of number of new fabs under construction, with\n8 out of 19 worldwide in 2021, and 17 fabs in total are expected to start\nconstruction from 2021 to 2023. Total installed capacity of Chinese-owned\nchipmakers will also increase from 2.96 million wafers per month (wpm) in 2020\nto 3.572 million wpm in 2021."

It is projected to reach\n1.2 billion by 2027, making up one fourth of the world total. According to a\n2021 Pew Research Center survey, there were 23 million Chinese individuals\nwith a per capita daily income of $50 or more, 242 million with a daily income\nbetween $20–50 per day, 493 million between $10–20, 641 million $2–10 per day,\nand 4 million under $2 per day; all the figures are expressed in international\ndollars and 2011 purchasing power parity values. In 2022, the National Bureau\nof Statistics reported that China's average disposable income per capita was\n¥36,883, of which ¥20,590 was from wages and salaries, ¥6,175 was net business\nincome, ¥3,227 was net income from property, and ¥6,892 was net transfer\nincome.\n\nAs of April 2023[update], China was second in the world, after the US, in\ntotal number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 495\nChinese billionaires and 6.2 million millionaires in 2022. According to the\nHurun Global Rich Report In 2020, China had the world's highest number of\nbillionaires, which is more than the US and India combined, and as of March\n2021, the number of billionaires in China reach 1,058 with the combined wealth\nof US$4.5 trillion. According to the 2019 Global Wealth Report by Credit\nSuisse Group, China surpassed the US in the wealth of the top ten percent of\nthe world's population. In other words, as of 2019, a hundred million Chinese\nare in the top ten percent of the wealthiest individuals in the world – those\nwho have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000. According to the list in\n2021, China is home to six of the world's top ten cities (Beijing, Shanghai,\nShenzhen, Hong Kong, Hangzhou and Guangzhou in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and\n9th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more\nthan any other country. As of January 2021, China had 85 female billionaires,\ntwo-thirds of the global total.\n\nThe average income of a rural resident in China is 30% of the average income\nfor an urban resident. The rural population is relatively older as the rural\nyouth migrate to cities for higher earning jobs while the aged stay behind.\nMuch of this rural population works small plots of land in order to survive\nand have little earning power. Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated, in\n2020, that 600 million Chinese live on or under 1,000 yuan per month. At a\nconversion rate of 7 yuan to the dollar, this translates to $143 per month. A\nfamily of 3 at this income level would have a yearly income of $5,150. The\ndifference in income is also a reflection of the difference in retirement\npayments to urban retirees versus rural retirees. Urban workers receive much\nmore a month in retirement benefits on average compared to rural/farm workers\nwho receive a pittance. Despite income inequality in China, the absolute\nincome of nearly all income groups has risen quickly. From 1988 to 2018,\nChina's rural and urban populations had per capita increases in real income\n(i.e., accounting for inflation) of 8–10 times.\n\nChina's economic growth led to a major decrease in world inequality. Since\nChina's Reform and Opening Up, more than 1 billion Chinese people have been\nlifted out of poverty. The majority of global poverty reduction between 1981\nand 2008 occurred in China. As academic Lan Xiaohuan writes, during that\nperiod, \"the number of poor people in the world outside China remained more or\nless unchanged. It can therefore be concluded that achievements in global\npoverty reduction come mainly from China.\"\n\nIn terms of domestic saving, defined as combined saving of households,\nbusinesses, and governments, China is the world's largest saving country as of\n2022."

As of 2022[update], China's largest trading partners\nare ASEAN, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Russia,\nBrazil, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a meaningful segment of China's trade with the Third\nWorld was financed through grants, credits, and other forms of assistance.\nHowever, after Mao Zedong's death in 1976, these efforts were scaled back.\nAfter which, trade with developing countries became negligible, though during\nthat time, Hong Kong and Taiwan both began to emerge as major trading\npartners.\n\nSince economic reforms began in the late 1970s, China sought to decentralize\nits foreign trade system to integrate itself into the international trading\nsystem. In November 1991, China joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n(APEC) group, which promotes free trade and cooperation in the economic,\ntrade, investment, and technology spheres. China served as APEC chair in 2001,\nand Shanghai hosted the annual APEC leaders meeting in October of that year.\n\nChina became a member of the World Trade Organization in 2001.

A spokesman for the Ministry of\nCommerce, Van Jingsun, said that the volume of trade between China and Russia\ncould exceed forty billion dollars in 2007. China's export of machinery and\nelectronic goods to Russia grew 70%, which is 24% of China's total export to\nRussia in the first eleven months of 2005. During the same time, China's\nexport of high-tech products to Russia increased by 58%, and that is 7% of\nChina's total exports to Russia. Also at that time period, border trade\nbetween the two countries reached $5.13 billion, growing 35% and accounting\nfor nearly 20% of the total trade. Most of China's exports to Russia remain\napparel and footwear. Russia is China's eighth largest trade partner and China\nis now Russia's fourth largest trade partner, and China now has over 750\ninvestment projects in Russia, involving $1.05 billion.

To increase exports, China pursued policies such as fostering\nthe rapid development of foreign-invested factories, which assembled imported\ncomponents into consumer goods for export and liberalizing trading rights.\nParticularly since 2000, the product complexity of China's exports have\nincreased. This has been driven both by increasing technical capabilities and\ninfrastructure as well as factors like China's business and legal environment.\nIn its 11th Five-Year Program, adopted in 2005, China placed greater emphasis\non developing a consumer demand-driven economy to sustain economic growth and\naddress imbalances.\n\nChina is a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),\nthe world's largest free-trade area which was signed into agreement in\nNovember 2020. The RCEP, which includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia,\nNew Zealand and the ASEAN nations, represents about a third of the world's\npopulation and 29% of global gross domestic product.

    "text": "From 1992 until at least 2023, China has been either the number one or number\ntwo worldwide destination for foreign direct investment. In 2022, China\nattracted $180 billion. As of the end of June 2020, FDI stock in China reached\nUS$2.947 trillion, and China's outgoing FDI stock stood at US$2.128 trillion.\nThe total foreign financial assets owned by China reached US$7.860 trillion,\nand its foreign financial liabilities US$5.716 trillion, making China the\nsecond largest creditor nation after Japan in the world.\n\nChina's investment climate has changed dramatically with more than two decades\nof reform. In the early 1980s, China restricted foreign investments to export-\noriented operations and required foreign investors to form joint-venture\npartnerships with Chinese firms. The Encouraged Industry Catalogue sets out\nthe degree of foreign involvement allowed in various industry sectors. From\nthe beginning of the reforms legalizing foreign investment, capital inflows\nexpanded every year until 1999. Foreign-invested enterprises account for\n58–60% of China's imports and exports.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the government has allowed foreign investors to\nmanufacture and sell a wide range of goods on the domestic market, eliminated\ntime restrictions on the establishment of joint ventures, provided some\nassurances against nationalization, allowed foreign partners to become chairs\nof joint venture boards, and authorized the establishment of wholly foreign-\nowned enterprises, now the preferred form of FDI. In 1991, China granted more\npreferential tax treatment for Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises and\ncontractual ventures and for foreign companies, which invested in selected\neconomic zones or in projects encouraged by the state.\n\nChina also authorized some foreign banks to open branches in Shanghai and\nallowed foreign investors to purchase special \"B\" shares of stock in selected\ncompanies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Securities Exchanges. These \"B\"\nshares sold to foreigners carried no ownership rights in a company. In 1997,\nChina approved 21,046 foreign investment projects and received over $45\nbillion in foreign direct investment. China revised significantly its laws on\nWholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and China Foreign Equity Joint Ventures in\n2000 and 2001. The Vice Minister of Finance Zhu Guangyao announced, foreign\ninvestors will be allowed to own up to 51% on domestic financial service\ncompanies. Formerly foreign ownership was limited to a 49% stake in these\nfirms.\n\nForeign investment remains a strong element in China's rapid expansion in\nworld trade and has been an important factor in the growth of urban jobs.\nChina's economic leadership on global capital flows emphasizes long-term\ninfrastructure and development finance over short-term flows which, under the\ncurrent order, have imposed large costs on many economies. In 1998, foreign-\ninvested enterprises produced about 40% of China's exports, and foreign\nexchange reserves totaled about $145 billion. Foreign-invested enterprises\ntoday produce about half of China's exports (the majority of China's foreign\ninvestment come from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), and China continues to\nattract large investment inflows. However, the Chinese government's emphasis\non guiding FDI into manufacturing has led to market saturation in some\nindustries, while leaving China's services sectors underdeveloped. From 1993\nto 2001, China was the world's second-largest recipient of foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) after the United States, receiving $39 billion in 1999 and\n$41 billion in 2000. China is now one of the leading FDI recipients in the\nworld, receiving almost $80 billion in 2005 according to World Bank\nstatistics. In 2006, China received $69.47 billion. By 2011, with the U.S.\nseeing a decline in foreign investment following the 2008 financial crisis,\nChina overtook it as the top destination for FDI, receiving over $280 billion\nthat year.\n\nAmid slowing economic conditions and a weakening yuan in 2015, December of\nthat year saw a 5.8% drop in FDI to China. While China's rank as the top\nreceiver of FDI continued through 2014, the slowing of inbound investment in\n2015 combined with a massive rebound in foreign investment to the United\nStates resulted in the U.S. reclaiming its position as the top investment\ndestination. Data from the American Chamber of Commerce in China's _2016 China\nBusiness Climate Survey_ confirms this trend, although it also demonstrates\nthat China remains a top investment destination. This survey of over 500\nmembers found that \"China remains a top three investment priority for six out\nof ten member companies,\" though this is a decline from the 2012 high of eight\nout of ten respondents considering China a top priority.\n\nForeign exchange reserves totaled $155 billion in 1999 and $165 billion in\n2000. Foreign exchange reserves exceeded $800 billion in 2005, more than\ndoubling from 2003. Foreign exchange reserves were $819 billion at the end of\n2005, $1.066 trillion at the end of 2006, $1.9 trillion by June 2008. In\naddition, by the end of September 2008 China replaced Japan for the first time\nas the largest foreign holder of US treasury securities with a total of $585\nbillion, vs Japan $573 billion. China's foreign exchange reserves are the\nlargest in the world.\n\nAs part of its WTO accession, China undertook to eliminate certain trade-\nrelated investment measures and to open up specified sectors that had\npreviously been closed to foreign investment. New laws, regulations, and\nadministrative measures to implement these commitments are being issued. Major\nremaining barriers to foreign investment include opaque and inconsistently\nenforced laws and regulations and the lack of a rules-based legal\ninfrastructure. Warner Bros., for instance, withdrew its cinema business in\nChina as a result of a regulation that requires Chinese investors to own at\nleast a 51 percent stake or play a leading role in a foreign joint venture.\n\nAnother major development in the history of foreign investment in China was\nthe establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in September 2013. The Zone\nis considered a testing ground for a number of economic and social reforms.\nCritically, foreign investment is controlled via a \"negative list\" approach,\nwhere FDI is permitted in all sectors unless explicitly prohibited by the\ninclusion of a given sector on the negative list published by the Shanghai\nMunicipal Government.\n\nOn 15 March 2019, China's National People's Congress adopted the Foreign\nInvestment Law, which comes into effect on 1 January 2020. Foreign investment\nin China comes with a number of ethical risks which pose major challenges\nwhich investors must navigate."

The huge Chinese domestic market help many Chinese companies accumulated financial capital to do M&A. Chinese government also provides long-term, low-interest capital for companies to expand abroad.\n* Low risk. M&A helped Chinese companies avoid risk of failure of organic growth as they got an established company with everything in place.\n* Cheap labor. Some companies may move part of the manufacturing in high labor cost countries to China to reduce the cost and make the product more attractive in price.\n* Trade and policy barrier. Chinese companies in many sectors face quota limitation and high tax, which prevent them from being competitive in foreign markets.\n* Depressed assets. 2008–2010 global economic crisis created liquidity problems for a lot of western companies and reduced their market value. Chinese companies believe it is a great opportunity for them to buy these depressed assets at discount. China's direct foreign investment in non-financial sector growth from US$25 billion in 2007 to US$90 billion in 2013, more than three times.\n* China is growing in investments and influencing power over Europe, and the EU has begun to take notice.\n\nAt the beginning, state-owned enterprises dominate the foreign acquisition and\nmost of the money goes to oil and minerals.

According to market\nconsecutive research by the Monogram Group, a Chicago-based advertising\nagency, in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012, American consumers' willingness to\npurchase Chinese products across all categories except PC remained the same or\nbecame worse during 2007–2012.

During 2003, 49% of the labor force worked\nin agriculture, forestry, and fishing; 22% in mining, manufacturing, energy,\nand construction industries; and 29% in the services sector and other\ncategories. In 2004 some 25 million persons were employed by 743,000 private\nenterprises.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe 2010 census found that China was now half urban and rapidly aging due to\nthe one child policy. This is expected to lead to increased demand for labor\nto take care of an elderly population and a reduced supply of migrant labor\nfrom the countryside.\n\nIn January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy, which was\nin turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021. In July 2021, all\nfamily size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.\n\nIn the decade up to 2014, ten million Chinese emigrated to other countries,\ntaking assets and their technical skills.\n\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the country's only legally\npermissible trade union. Attempts to form trade unions independent of the\nACFTU have been rare and short-lived. One notable example is the Beijing\nWorkers' Autonomous Federation formed during the 1989 Tiananmen Square\nprotests and massacre. Martial Law Command Headquarters issued a public notice\ndeclaring the BWAF an illegal organization and ordering it to disband on the\ngrounds that Federation leaders were among \"the main instigators and\norganizers in the capital of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.\n\nAs of 2024, China has one of the lowest retirement ages among major world\neconomies, with many working women eligible for retirement at 50 and men at\n60."

    "text": "China has the world's longest and most extensively used high-speed rail\nnetwork in the world — the network extends over 45,000 kilometers.\n\nChina's transportation policy, influenced by political, military, and economic\nconcerns, has undergone major changes since 1949.\n\nImmediately after the People's Republic was founded, the primary goal was to\nrepair existing transportation infrastructure in order to meet military\ntransport and logistics needs as well as to strengthen territorial integrity.\nDuring most of the 1950s, new road and rail links were built, while at the\nsame time old ones were improved. During the 1960s much of the improvement of\nregional transportation became the responsibility of the local governments,\nand many small railways were constructed. Emphasis was also placed on\ndeveloping transportation in remote rural, mountainous, and forested areas, in\norder to integrate poorer regions of the country and to help promote economies\nof scale in the agricultural sector.[_citation needed_]\n\nBefore the reform era began in the late 1970s, China's transportation links\nwere mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and access to the inner regions\nwas generally poor. This situation has been improved considerably since then,\nas railways and highways have been built in the remote and frontier regions of\nthe northwest and southwest. At the same time, the development of\ninternational transportation was also pursued, and the scope of ocean shipping\nwas broadened considerably.[_citation needed_]\n\nFreight haulage is mainly provided by rail transport. The rail sector is\nmonopolized by China Railway and there is wide variation in services provided.\nIn late 2007 China became one of the few countries in the world to launch its\nown indigenously developed high-speed train. As rail capacity is struggling to\nmeet demand for the transport of goods and raw materials such as coal, air\nroutes, roads and waterways are rapidly being developed to provide an\nincreasing proportion of China's overall transportation needs.\n\nSome economic experts have argued that the development gap between China and\nother emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can be attributed\nto a large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects:\nwhile China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and\n2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This\nconsiderable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal\nconditions while many South American economies suffered from various\ndevelopment bottlenecks such as poor transportation networks, aging power\ngrids and mediocre schools."

The\nChinese government has placed emphasis through funding, reform, and societal\nstatus on science and technology as a fundamental part of the socio-economic\ndevelopment of the country as well as for national prestige. China has made\nrapid advances in areas such as education, infrastructure, high-tech\nmanufacturing, artificial intelligence, academic publishing, patents and\ncommercial applications. China is now increasingly targeting indigenous\ninnovation and aims to reform remaining weaknesses. Its Thousand Talents Plan\naims to attract innovative Chinese academics living abroad (as well as some\nforeigners) back to China in support of its economic innovation goals.\n\nA 2023 Australian Strategic Policy Institute study of what it deemed as 44\ncritical technologies concluded that China leads the world in 37 of them,\nincluding 5G internet, electric batteries, and hypersonic missiles."
