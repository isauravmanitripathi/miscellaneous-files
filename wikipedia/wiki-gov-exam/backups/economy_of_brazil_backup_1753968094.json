    "text": "The **economy of Brazil** is the largest in Latin America and the Southern\nHemisphere in nominal terms. As of 2024, the Brazilian economy is the third\nlargest in the Americas in nominal terms, and second largest in purchasing\npower parity. It is an upper-middle income developing economy. In 2024,\naccording to International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil had the 10th largest\nnominal gross domestic product in the world, but the 7th largest purchasing\npower parity GDP in the world. In 2024, according to _Forbes_ , Brazil was the\n7th largest country in the world by number of billionaires. Brazil is one of\nthe ten chief industrial states in the world according to International Labour\nOrganization. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil's\nnominal GDP was US$2.331 trillion; the country has a long history of being\namong the largest economies in the world and the GDP per capita was US$11,178\nper inhabitant.\n\nThe country is rich in natural resources. From 2000 to 2012, Brazil was one of\nthe fastest-growing major economies in the world, with an average annual GDP\ngrowth rate of over 5%. Its GDP surpassed that of the United Kingdom in 2012,\ntemporarily making Brazil the world's sixth-largest economy. However, Brazil's\neconomic growth decelerated in 2013 and the country entered a recession in\n2014. The economy started to recover in 2017, with a 1% growth in the first\nquarter, followed by a 0.3% growth in the second quarter compared to the same\nperiod of the previous year. It officially exited the recession.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Brazil was the top country in upward\nevolution of competitiveness in 2009, gaining eight positions among other\ncountries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the\ncompetitiveness gap with India and China among the BRICS economies. Important\nsteps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures\ntaken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the\ncountry's competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for\nprivate-sector development.\n\nBrazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as Mercosur,\nProsur, G8+5, G20, WTO, Paris Club, Cairns Group, and is advanced to be a\npermanent member of the OECD.\n\nFrom a colony focused on primary sector goods (sugar, gold and cotton), Brazil\nmanaged to create a diversified industrial base during the 20th century. The\nsteel industry is a prime example of that, with Brazil being the 9th largest\nsteel producer in 2018, and the 5th largest steel net exporter in 2018. Gerdau\nis the largest producer of long steel in the Americas, and Vale is the largest\nproducer of iron ore in the world. Petrobras, the Brazilian oil and gas\ncompany, is the most valuable company in Latin America.",

    "text": "When the Portuguese explorers arrived in the 16th century, the native tribes\nof current-day Brazil totaled about 2.5 million people and had lived virtually\nunchanged since the Stone Age. From Portugal's colonization of Brazil\n(1500–1822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the\nproduction of primary products for exports.\n\nIn the Portuguese Empire, Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial\nmercantile policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles\n– sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of\nBrazil was heavily dependent on African slave labor until the late 19th\ncentury (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period\nBrazil was also the colony with the largest number of European settlers, most\nof them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see\nDutch Brazil), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish\nand Sephardic Jews.\n\nSubsequently, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic\ngrowth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe, mainly from Portugal\n(including the Azores and Madeira), Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, Ukraine,\nSwitzerland, Austria and Russia. Smaller numbers of immigrants also came from\nthe Netherlands, France, Finland, Iceland and the Scandinavian countries,\nLithuania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, England, Ireland,\nScotland, Croatia, Czech Republic, Malta, North Macedonia and Luxembourg, the\nMiddle East (mainly from Lebanon, Syria and Armenia), Japan, the United States\nand South Africa, until the 1930s. In fact, international mass immigration to\nBrazil during the 19th century had positive effects on the country's human\ncapital development. Immigrants usually exhibited better formal and informal\ntraining than native Brazilians and tended to have more entrepreneurial\nspirit. Their arrival was beneficial for the region, not only because of the\nskills and knowledge they brought to the country themselves, but also because\nof spillover effects of their human capital to the native Brazilian\npopulation. Human capital spillover effects were strongest in regions with the\nhighest numbers of immigrants, and the positive effects are still observable\ntoday, in some regions.\n\nIn 2007, with a population of over 190 million and abundant natural resources,\nBrazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of\nmillions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5 million television\nsets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70 million cubic meters\nof petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane\ngas, and a wide range of hundreds of petrochemicals.\n\nBrazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads, more than 150 gigawatts\nof installed electric power capacity and its real per capita GDP surpassed\nUS$9,800 in 2017. Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the South\nAmerican economy's industrial production. The country's scientific and\ntechnological development is argued to be attractive to foreign direct\ninvestment, in 2019, Brazil occupied the 4th largest destination for foreign\ninvestments, behind only the United States, China and Singapore.\n\nThe agricultural sector, locally called the _agronegócio_ (agro-business), has\nalso been dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil among the most\nhighly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector. The\nagricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which\nallowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to\na downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt\nthe appreciation of the real.\n\nOne of the most important corruption cases in Brazil concerns the company\nOdebrecht. Since the 1980s, Odebrecht has spent several billion dollars in the\nform of bribes to bribe parliamentarians to vote in favour of the group. At\nthe municipal level, Odebrecht's corruption was aimed at \"stimulating\nprivatisations\", particularly in water and sewer management.",

In the total\ngeneration of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of\ninstalled capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority,\nhydroelectric).\n\nAngra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro\n\nIn 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National\nIntegrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the\ncountry. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost\n42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity.\nThe hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed\ncapacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric\ngeneration. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by\nabout 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest.\nThe South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric\nplant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges\nDam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the\nworld. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is\nlocated on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has\nan installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW\neach. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and\nTucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric\npotential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the\ncapacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.\n\nOil platform P-51 of Petrobras.\n\nAs of July 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power\nwas 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind\nproduction capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil,\nspecially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity\nfactors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45%\nin the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of\nthe energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the\ncountry had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW\n(this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current\ndemand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed\nwind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world\n(72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.\n\nNuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity. The nuclear\npower generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear\nS/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by\ntwo reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro\nAlberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It\nconsists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW,\nconnected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW,\nconnected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of\n1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.\n\nAs of October 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of\nphotovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%. Some of the\nmost irradiated Brazilian States are MG (\"Minas Gerais\"), BA (\"Bahia\") and GO\n(Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records. In 2019, solar\npower represented 1,27% of the energy generated in the country. In 2021,\nBrazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13\nGW), and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).\n\nIn 2020, Brazil was also the 2nd largest country in the world in the\nproduction of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels\nand renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.\n\nTotal energy consumption in Terrawatt-hours (TWh)  1970  | 1980  | 1990  | 2000  | 2010  | 2020  | 2023\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n453  | 1,153  | 1,566  | 2,357  | 3,185  | 3,394  | 3,854\nPer capita energy consumption in Kilowatt-hours (KWh)\n4,704  | 9,430  | 10,391  | 13,400  | 16,221  | 15,921  | 17,806\nOil production in Terrawatt-hours (TWh)\n102  | 115  | 397  | 780  | 1,298  | 1,853  | 2,136"

Port of Santos, one of the 40 largest and busiest\nports in the world.\n\nTransport in Brazil is basically carried out using the road mode, the most\ndeveloped in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports\nand airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is\nusually treated in a secondary way.\n\nBrazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved,\nand about 17,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in\nthe country are BR-101 and BR-116. Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River\nand Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing\ntranscontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that\nexisted was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and\nlater to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined\neffort of South American countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as\nBrazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil,\nParaguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).\n\nThere are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second\nlargest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São\nPaulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo,\nis the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to\npractically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international\nairports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto\nAlegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus,\namong others. The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São\nPaulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil),\nSantiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),\nBuenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and\nMinas Gerais (Brazil).\n\nAbout ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as\nPort of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí,\nPort of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. The 15\nbusiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de\nCartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires\n(Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil),\nValparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande\n(Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).\n\nThe Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It\nis basically used for transporting ores.\n\nAmong the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná\n(which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the\nTietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso,\nMato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas General)\nand Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which\nextends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas,\nwhich extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km.\n\nAlmost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon basin is done by this\nwaterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed\nto the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport\nis still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an\neconomic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country.\nIts full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works\nand, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration."

There are several factors that cause this problem, the main\nones being: the excessive collection of taxes on production (due to the\ncountry's economic and legislative model being based on State Capitalism and\nnot on Free-Market Capitalism), the lack or deficiency of infrastructure\n(means of transport such as roads, railways and ports that are insufficient or\nweak for the country's needs, bad logistics and excessive bureaucracy) for\nexport, high production costs (expensive energy, expensive fuel, expensive\nmaintenance of trucks, expensive loan rates and bank financing for production,\nexpensive export rates), the lack of an industrial policy, the lack of focus\non adding value, the lack of aggressiveness in international negotiations, in\naddition to abusive tariff barriers imposed by other countries on the\ncountry's exports. Because of this, Brazil has never been very prominent in\ninternational trade.\n\nDue to its size and potential, it would be able to be among the 10 largest\nexporters in the world, however, its participation in global commercial\ntransactions usually oscillates between 0.5 and 2% only. In 2019, among the\nten products that Brazil exports the most and that generate the most value,\neight come from the agribusiness. Although still modest, the country's exports\nhave evolved, and today they are more diversified than they were in the past.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, 70% of Brazilian exports were restricted\nto coffee. Overall, however, global trade still concentrates its few exports\non low-tech products (mainly agricultural and mineral commodities) and,\ntherefore, with low added value."

These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of\nFiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive\nbranches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments\nwere made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to\nencourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating \"windows of opportunity\"\nfor local and international investors and producers.\n\nWith these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it does\nnot import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through\nexchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by\n20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector\nor inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a liquidity\ncrisis. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive\nbalance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments,\nservices and overseas payment.
