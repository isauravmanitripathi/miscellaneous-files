Land in\nZimbabwe was forcibly seized from white farmers and redistributed to black\nsettlers, justified by Mugabe on the grounds that it was meant to rectify\ninequalities left over from colonialism. The new owners did not have land\ntitles, and as such did not have the collateral necessary to access bank\nloans. The small-scale farmers also did not have experience with commercial-\nscale agriculture.\n\nAfter land redistribution, much of Zimbabwe's land went fallow, and\nagricultural production decreased steeply. The University of Zimbabwe\nestimated in 2008 that between 2000 and 2007 agricultural production decreased\nby 51%. Production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's main export crop, decreased by 79%\nfrom 2000 to 2008.\n\nTobacco production recovered after 2008 thanks to the contract system of\nagriculture and growing Chinese demand. International tobacco companies, such\nas British American Tobacco and China Tobacco, supplied farmers with\nagricultural inputs, equipment, and loans, and supervised them in growing\ntobacco. By 2018, tobacco production had recovered to 258 million kg, the\nsecond largest crop on record. Instead of large white-owned farms selling\nmostly to European and American companies, Zimbabwe's tobacco sector now\nconsists of small black-owned farms exporting over half of the crop to China.\nTobacco farming accounted for 11% of Zimbabwe's GDP in 2017, and 3 million of\nits 16 million people depended on tobacco for their livelihood.\n\nLand reform has found considerable support in Africa and a few supporters\namong African-American activists, but Jesse Jackson commented during a visit\nto South Africa in June 2006, \"Land redistribution has long been a noble goal\nto achieve but it has to be done in a way that minimises trauma.

    "text": "Official, black market, and OMIR exchange rates Jan 1, 2001 to Feb 2, 2009.\nNote the logarithmic scale.\n\nZimbabwe began experiencing severe foreign exchange shortages, exacerbated by\nthe difference between the official rate and the black market rate in 2000. In\n2004 a system of auctioning scarce foreign currency for importers was\nintroduced, which temporarily led to a slight reduction in the foreign\ncurrency crisis, but by mid-2005 foreign currency shortages were once again\nsevere. The currency was devalued by the central bank twice, first to 9,000 to\nthe US$, and then to 17,500 to the US$ on 20 July 2005, but at that date it\nwas reported that that was only half the rate available on the black market.\n\nIn July 2005 Zimbabwe was reported to be appealing to the South African\ngovernment for US$1 billion of emergency loans, but despite regular rumours\nthat the idea was being discussed no substantial financial support has been\npublicly reported.\n\nIn December 2005 Zimbabwe made a mystery loan repayment of US$120 million to\nthe International Monetary Fund due to expulsion threat from IMF.\n\nThe official Zimbabwean dollar exchange rate had been frozen at Z$101,196 per\nU.S. dollar since early 2006, but as of 27 July 2006 the parallel (black\nmarket) rate has reached Z$550,000 per U.S. dollar. By comparison, 10 years\nearlier, the rate of exchange was only Z$9.13 per USD.\n\nIn August 2006 the RBZ revalued the Zimbabwean Dollar by 1000 ZWD to 1\n(revalued) dollar. At the same time Zimbabwe devalued the Zim Dollar by 60%\nagainst the USD. New official exchange rate revalued ZWD 250 per USD. The\nparallel market rate was about revalued ZWD 1,200 to 1,500 per USD (28\nSeptember 2006).\n\nIn November 2006, it was announced that sometime around 1 December there would\nbe a further devaluation and that the official exchange rate would change to\nrevalued ZWD 750 per USD. This never materialized. However, the parallel\nmarket immediately reacted to this news with the parallel rate falling to ZWD\n2,000 per USD (18 November 2006) and by year end it had fallen to ZWD 3,000\nper USD.\n\nOn 1 April 2007, the parallel market was asking ZWD 30,000 for US$1. By year\nend, it was down to about ZWD 2,000,000. On 18 January 2008, the Reserve Bank\nof Zimbabwe began to issue higher denomination ZWD bearer cheques (a banknote\nwith an expiry date), including $10 million bearer cheques – each of which was\nworth less than US$1.35 (70p Sterling; 0.90 Euro) on the parallel market at\nthe time of first issue. On 4 April 2008 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe\nintroduced new $25 million and $50 million bearer cheques. At the time of\nfirst issue they were worth US$0.70 and US$1.40 on the parallel market\nrespectively.\n\nOn 1 May 2008, the RBZ announced that the dollar would be allowed to float in\nvalue subject to some conditions.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, the RBZ issued new $100 million and $250 million bearer\ncheques. At the date of first issue the $250 million bearer cheque was worth\napproximately US$1.30 on the parallel market. On 15 May 2008, a new $500\nmillion bearer cheque was issued by the RBZ. At the time of the first issue it\nwas worth US$1.93. In a widely unreported parallel move, on 15 May 2008, the\nRBZ issued three \"special agro-cheques\" with face values $5 billion (at time\nof first issue – $19.30), $25 billion ($96.50) and $50 billion ($193). It is\nfurther reported that the new agro-cheques can be used to buy any goods and\nservices like the bearer cheques.\n\nOn 30 July 2008, the Governor of the RBZ, Gideon Gono announced that the\nZimbabwe dollar would be redenominated by removing 10 zeroes, with effect from\n1 August 2008. ZWD10billion became 1 dollar after the redenomination.\n\nMore banknotes were issued since Gono vowed to continue printing money:\n$10,000 and $20,000 (29 September); $50,000 (13 October); $100,000, $500,000\nand $1 million (3 November); $10 million (2 December); $50 million and $100\nmillion (4 December); $200 million (9 December); $500 million (11 December);\n$10 billion (19 December); $1 trillion (17 January 2009).\n\nOn February 2, 2009, a final denomination was implemented, cutting 12 zeroes,\nbefore the Zimbabwe dollar was officially abandoned on April 12, 2009.

The Zimbabwean dollar quickly lost all credibility, and by April\n2009, the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended entirely, to be replaced by the US\ndollar in government transactions. In 2014 there were eight legal currencies –\nUS dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling,\nAustralian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.\n\nDollarization reversed inflation, permitting the banking system to stabilize\nand the economy to resume slow growth after 2009. Dollarization also had other\nconsequences, including:\n\n* Reduced taxation and financial transparency, as people continued to keep their money out of the formal banking system.\n* Extremely high real interest rates due to lack of capital.\n* Government forced into a \"pay as you go\" system, unable to spend more than it takes in.\n* Deficits of coinage for everyday transactions, leading to the adoption of South African rand coins, sweets, airtime for mobile phones or even condoms for small change.\n* Counterfeiting currencies with which Zimbabweans are not familiar.\n* 10% growth of the economy a year up to 2012\n\nIn January, 2013 Finance Minister Tendai Biti announced that Zimbabwe's\nnational public account held just $217. The election budget for the July 2013\npresidential election was $104 million and government budget for 2013 was\n$3.09 billion at a projected economic growth of 5 per cent. The Economist\ndescribed the 2013 election as \"rigged\" and how, after regaining full control\nof the government, the Mugabe government doubled the civil service and\nembarked on \"...misrule and dazzling corruption.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Zimbabwe began selling treasury bills and bonds to pay public\nsector salaries that have been delayed as GDP growth weakens while the economy\nexperiences deflation. US$2 million was sold in July through private\nplacements of Six-month Treasury bills at an interest rate of 9.5%. According\nto IMF data, GDP growth was forecast to be 3.1% by the end of 2014, a major\ndecline from an average rate of 10% between 2009 and 2012, while government\ndata showed that consumer prices declined for five consecutive months by the\nend of June. The Reserve Bank continued to issue large values of treasury\nbills to support the government's over-budget spending. This added to the\nmoney supply and in effect devalued all bank balances, despite them being US\nDollar denominated.\n\nIn November 2016 a pseudo-currency was issued in the form of Bond Notes\ndespite widespread protests against them. In February 2019, John Mangudya,\nthrough a monetary policy presentation formally introduced a new currency, the\nRTGS dollar which consists of electronic balances in banks and mobile wallets,\nbond notes and bond coins. This completed the conversion of all US Dollar\ndenominated bank balances to a devalued Zimbabwean currency at a rate of 1:1.\n\nIn June 2019 the use of foreign currencies in local transactions was\nprohibited as part of the prospective plan for a new national currency and\nthus ended the dollarization period. There was still low volume trade in US\nDollars, particularly in the informal sector and using in-shop bureau de\nchange. In March 2020, blaming the challenges of dealing with COVID-19, the\ngovernment allowed formal transactions in US Dollars once more. Zimbabwe once\nmore extended its multi-currency system from 2025 until 31 December 2030 in\nOctober 2023 as a result of declining trust in the Zimbabwean dollar, which\nalso declined by more than 80% in 2023.",
