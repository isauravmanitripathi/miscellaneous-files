    "text": "| This article's **lead section may be too long**. Please read the length\nguidelines and help move details into the article's body. _( February 2025)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of the Dominican Republic** is the seventh largest in Latin\nAmerica, and is the largest in the Caribbean and Central American region. The\nDominican Republic is an upper-middle income developing country with important\nsectors including mining, tourism, manufacturing (medical devices, electrical\nequipment, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals), energy, real estate,\ninfrastructure, telecommunications and agriculture. The Dominican Republic is\non track to achieve its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2030, and is\nexpected to grow 79% in this decade. The country is the site of the single\nlargest gold mine in Latin America, the Pueblo Viejo mine. Although the\nservice sector is currently the leading employer of Dominicans (due\nprincipally to growth in tourism and free-trade zones), agriculture remains an\nimportant sector in terms of the domestic market and is in second place\n(behind mining) in terms of export earnings. Tourism accounts for more than\n$7.4 billion in annual earnings in 2019. Free-trade zone earnings and tourism\nare the fastest-growing export sectors. A leading growth engine in the Free-\ntrade zone sector is the production of medical equipment for export having a\nvalue-added per employee of US$20,000, total revenue of US$1.5 billion, and a\ngrowth rate of 7.7% in 2019. The medical instrument export sector represents\none of the highest-value added sectors of the country's economy, a true growth\nengine for the country's emerging market. Remittances are an important sector\nof the economy, contributing US$8.2 billion in 2020. Most of these funds are\nused to cover household expenses, such as housing, food, clothing, health care\nand education. Secondarily, remittances have financed businesses and\nproductive activities. Thirdly, this combined effect has induced investment by\nthe private sector and helps fund the public sector through its value-added\ntax. The combined import market including the free-trade-zones amounts to a\nmarket of $20 billion a year in 2019. The combined export sector had revenues\ntotaling $11 billion in 2019. The consumer market is equivalent to $61 billion\nin 2019. An important indicator is the average commercial loan interest rate,\nwhich directs short-term investment and stimulates long-term investment in the\neconomy. It is currently 8.30%, as of June 2021.\n\nThe Dominican Republic's most important trading partner is the United States\n(over 40% of total commercial exchange; over $12 billion in trade). Other\nmajor trade partners are China (over $3 billion in trade), Switzerland (over\n$1 billion), Puerto Rico (over $800 million), Mexico (over $700 million),\nHaiti (over $700 million), Spain (over $700 million), the Netherlands (over\n$700 million), Canada (over $600 million), Brazil (over $500 million), and\nGermany (over $500 million), in that quantitative order. The country exports\nfree-trade-zone manufactured products (medical devices, electrical equipment,\npharmaceuticals, and chemicals), gold, nickel, agricultural products, liquor,\ncocoa beans, silver, and sauces and seasonings. It imports petroleum,\nindustrial raw materials, capital goods, and foodstuffs. On 5 September 2005,\nthe Congress of the Dominican Republic ratified a free trade agreement with\nthe U.S. and five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic – Central\nAmerica Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). CAFTA-DR entered into force for the\nDominican Republic on 1 March 2007. The total stock of U.S. foreign direct\ninvestment (FDI) in Dominican Republic as of 2019 was U.S. $42 billion, much\nof it directed to the energy, tourism, real estate, manufacturing,\ninfrastructure and the telecommunications sectors. In 2019 the foreign direct\ninvestment stock amounted to $42 billion a significant growth in the last\ndecade and a half. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign direct\ninvestment flows in the Dominican Republic had remained strong at $2.5 billion\nadded to the stock in that year. Having grown to an estimated $44.5 billion,\nand growing more than ten-fold since 2006 when the liberalization efforts\nbegan.\n\nAn important aspect of the Dominican economy is the Free Trade Zone industry\n(FTZ), which made up U.S. $6.2 billion in Dominican exports for 2019. Reports\nshow, however, that the FTZs lost approximately 60,000 between 2005 and 2007\nand suffered a 4% decrease in total exports in 2006. The textiles sector\nexperienced an approximate 17% drop in exports in 2006 due in part to the\nappreciation of the Dominican peso against the dollar, Asian competition\nfollowing expiration of the quotas of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, and a\ngovernment-mandated increase in salaries, which should have occurred in 2005\nbut was postponed to January 2006. Lost Dominican business was captured by\nfirms in Central America and Asia. The tobacco, jewelry, medical, and\npharmaceutical sectors in the FTZs all reported increases for 2006, which\noffset textile and garment losses. Industry experts from the FTZs expected\nthat entry into force of the CAFTA-DR agreement would promote substantial\ngrowth in the FTZ sector in 2007. By the end of the last decade-and-a-half the\nfree-trade-zone sector has rebounded and surpassed the former amounts of $4.5\nbillion in 2006 to grow to $6.2 billion by 2019.",

Value of agricultural output\ngrew at an average annual rate of 7.1% during 1968–73, but since 1975 the\nsector has been hampered by droughts (1975, 1977, and 1979), hurricanes (in\n1979 and 1980), and slumping world prices and quota allocations for sugar\n(since 1985). In 1999, agricultural production was 0.4% higher than during\n1989–91. The fertile Cibao Valley is the main agricultural center. In 1998,\narable land totaled 1,020,000 hectares (2,500,000 acres); with land under\npermanent crops at 480,000 hectares (1,200,000 acres).\n\nAfter Cuba, the Dominican Republic is the second-largest Caribbean producer of\nsugarcane, the nation's most important crop. The State Sugar Council operates\n12 sugar mills and accounts for about half of total production. Other large\nproducers are the privately owned Vicini, with three mills, and Central Romana\nCorporation, whose mill is the largest in the country. Sugar is grown in the\nsoutheastern plains, around Barahona & on the North Coast Plain. In 1999,\nsugar production was 4.4 million tons, down from an average of 7.1 million\ntons during 1989–1991. Output of sugar has declined annually since 1982, and\nland is gradually being taken out of sugar production and switched to food\ncrops. Production of raw sugar rose from 636,000 tons in 1990 to 813,000 tons\nin 1997 but fell to 374,000 tons in 1999.\n\nPart of the crop was destroyed by hurricanes in 1979 and 1980, and 1979–80\nproduction was only 670,000 bags (40,200 tons). Although production was\nusually about 57,000–59,000 tons annually in the 1980s, the acreage harvested\ndeclined from 157,000 hectares (390,000 acres) in the early 1980s to 139,000\nhectares (340,000 acres) in 1999, indicating a greater yield per acre. Coffee\nproduction in 1999 was estimated at 35,000 tons; exports of coffee in 2001\ngenerated $11 million. Cocoa and tobacco are also grown for export. Dominican\nRepublic is one of the top 10 major producer and exporter of cocoa in the\nworld. Cocoa is also grown in the Cibao Valley around San Francisco de\nMacoris. Tobacco is also grown in the Cibao Valley, but around Santiago. In\n1999, production of cocoa beans was 26,000 tons and of tobacco, 35,000 tons.\nRice is grown around Monte Cristi & San Francisco de Macoris. Banana\nproduction in 1999 was 432,000 tons. Production of other crops in 1999 (in\nthousands of tons) included rice, 563; coconuts, 184; cassava, 127; tomatoes,\n281; pulses, 69; dry beans, 26; eggplants, 7; and peanuts, 2.",

In\n2016 the country produced almost 38 tons. The country had almost zero\nproduction of silver until 2008, where it grew exponentially. In 2017 the\ncountry produced 147 tons.\n\nFerronickel was the country's leading export commodity and third-leading\nindustry. Nickel is mined at Bonao. In 2000, nickel production was 39,943\ntons, ranking tenth in the world, a decrease from 49,152 in 1997. Currently\nthe most important mineral export is gold.\n\nProduction of gold in the Pueblo Viejo mine is the largest gold producing mine\nin Latin America, and fourth most productive mine in the world producing a\ntotal of 30,100 kg of gold in 2018. The extraction by a foreign company of\ngold at one of the largest mines in the Western Hemisphere has startled and\nconcerned a part of the country who believe that the natural resource should\nbe extracted by local companies and not foreign. Some groups began to protest\nagainst Barrick Gold in 2009 and 2010. In 2019 gold is one of the largest\nexports of the country totaling $1.6 billion and has helped to balance the\ncommodity current account balance.\n\nProduction of bauxite, traditionally the principal mining product, ceased in\n1992. The Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) mined bauxite between 1959 and 1983,\nwhen it turned its concession over to the state. Production in 1991 dropped\n92% from the previous year, as a presidential decree suspended mining\noperations at the largest mine, in response to increasing fears of\ndeforestation, although reforestation of mined areas was in progress. Output\naveraged 1 million tons each year.\n\nThe country was one of the few sources of amber in the Western Hemisphere.\nSalt Mountain, a 16 km block of almost solid salt west of Barahona, was the\nworld's largest known salt deposit. There were also large deposits of gypsum\nnear Salt Mountain, making the Dominican Republic one of three sources of\ngypsum in the Caribbean.
