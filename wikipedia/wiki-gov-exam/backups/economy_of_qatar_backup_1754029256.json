The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939. In 1973, oil\nproduction and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks\nof the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per\ncapita incomes in the world.\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of\nPetroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price\nfor oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets\nreduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to\nbe cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business\nclimate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy\nrecovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and\nSouth Asia, have grown again.\n\nOil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000\nm3) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023.\nHowever, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast\ncoast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and\ncondensate reserves. For example, the state owned QatarEnergy corporation\nfound two offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too\nexpensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years\nlater.\n\nThe gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised\nrefineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to\nuse the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3\nblocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities\n(PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture\nproduction facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d). Like\nwith gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and\ncould increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023\nis delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore\nexploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in\nJune 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from\nFebruary 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids\ntogether Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding\n7000 km3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by\ncompletion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In\n1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to\nJapan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of\ndollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery\nwith a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m3) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea\nand ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries\nuse gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms\nand the state-owned QatarEnergy corporation (formerly QGPC). The U.S. is the\nmajor equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies\nare playing a major role in North Field gas development.\n\nQatar pursues a vigorous program of \"Qatarization\", under which all joint\nventure industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals\ninto positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated\nQataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key\npositions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of\nexpatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign\nmanpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis\nfor Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.",

Accordingly, careful planning has\ngone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has\nbeen clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed\nIndustrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen\nconsiderable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of\npetrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed\nonly in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's\nlargest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-\nlargest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about\n7.5% of GDP. Industry in Qatar is regulated by the Ministry of Business and\nTrade.\n\nPetrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the\nindustrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through\nQatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past\nfew years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the\ndevelopment boom swept the Persian Gulf region. The 2008 financial crisis\nreduced demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor\nsentiment remains cautious. The crisis impacted the whole of the industrial\nsector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than\n90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector\nhas fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of\n$2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital\ninvestments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example,\nis pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead.",

In a bid to strengthen the banks’\npositions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that\nit was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by\nway of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and\nan additional 5% at the end of 2009.\n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy\nthe investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to\ncontinue lending.
