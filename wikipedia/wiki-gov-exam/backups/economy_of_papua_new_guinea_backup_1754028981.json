However,\naccording to the Asian Development Bank its GDP is expected to grow 3.4% in\n2022 and 4.6% in 2023. It is dominated by the agricultural, forestry, and\nfishing sector and the minerals and energy extraction sector. The\nagricultural, forestry, and fishing sector accounts for most of the labour\nforce of PNG while the minerals and energy extraction sector, including gold,\ncopper, oil and natural gas is responsible for most of the export earnings.\n\nMain market in Goroka\n\nPNG's GDP growth has been driven by the extraction industries and real GDP\ngrowth per capita has averaged 4% since mid-2000. The GDP Growth rate for PNG\nin 2021 was at 1.3%. The country has made significant progress investing\nproceeds from oil and gas in infrastructure building. As a result, its major\ncities like Port Moresby and Lae have received increased international\ninvestor attention, giving rise to an unprecedented building boom to exploit\nthe opportunities presented by the country's rise as a regional economic\nleader in the South Pacific region. This is well supported by its strategic\nlocation as a gateway from the Pacific to Asia, as well as its comparatively\nhuge landmass and demographic profile (almost 7 times that of the rest of the\nsmaller Pacific Island nations)\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has reported that despite PNG's poverty, it is\nrichly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation has been hampered by\nthe rugged terrain and the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture\nprovides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk of the population. Mineral\ndeposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account for 72% of export earnings.\n\nBudgetary support from Australia and development aid under World Bank auspices\ncontinue to sustain the economy. Australia is PNG's largest aid donor, and\nwill provide $479.2 million of aid in 2023. In June 2021 the World Bank\napproved a US$100 million (PGK 352 million equivalent) operation to support\nPapua New Guinea in its response to COVID-19, and to lay important foundations\nfor a sustainable recovery.",

    "text": "Port Moresby's central business district\n\nPapua New Guinea is classified as a developing economy by the International\nMonetary Fund. The economy is largely dependent on natural resources. As of\n2018, natural resource extraction made up 28% of overall GDP, with substantial\ncontributors including minerals, oil, and natural gas.\n\nAccording to the Investment Promotion Authority of Papua New Guinea the major\neconomic sectors are agriculture and livestock, forestry, mining and\npetroleum, tourism and hospitality, fisheries and marine resources,\nmanufacturing, retailing and wholesaling, building and construction, transport\nand telecommunications, and finance and business trade. The economy generally\ncan be separated into subsistence and market sectors, although the distinction\nis blurred by smallholder cash cropping of coffee, cocoa, and copra. About 75%\nof the country's population relies primarily on the subsistence economy. The\nminerals, timber, and fish sectors are dominated by foreign investors.\nManufacturing is limited, and the formal labour sector consequently also is\nlimited.\n\nTimber and marine resources are also exported, with the country being one of\nthe few suppliers of tropical timber, Forestry is an important economic\nresource for Papua New Guinea, but the industry uses low and semi-intensive\ntechnological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber,\nveneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a\nfew limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery,\ncoupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the\nobstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Forestry is an avenue\nfor corruption and many projects face legal uncertainty. Up to 70% of logging\nmay be illegal. Marine fisheries provide around 10% of global catch.\n\nOther sources include renewable resources, such as forests, marine resources\n(including a large portion of the world's major tuna stocks), and in some\nparts agriculture. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a\nlivelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP.\nOil palm production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates\nand with extensive outgrower output), with palm oil now the main agricultural\nexport. Coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the\nHighlands provinces); followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from the coastal\nareas, each largely produced by smallholders; tea, produced on estates; and\nrubber.[_citation needed_]\n\nMeasuring economic growth is tricky due to the resource-dependent economy\ndistorting GDP. Other metrics such as Gross national income are hard to\nmeasure. Even historical GDP estimates have changed dramatically. As of 2019,\nPNG's real GDP growth rate was 3.8%, with an inflation rate of 4.3% This\neconomic growth has been primarily attributed to strong commodity prices,\nparticularly mineral but also agricultural, with the high demand for mineral\nproducts largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant Asian\nmarkets, a booming mining sector and by a buoyant outlook and the construction\nphase for natural gas exploration, production, and exportation in liquefied\nform (liquefied natural gas or \"LNG\") by LNG tankers, all of which will\nrequire multibillion-dollar investments (exploration, production wells,\npipelines, storage, liquefaction plants, port terminals, LNG tanker ships).\n\nFormal employment is low. There is a minimum wage, but it has declined in real\nterms since independence. In the late 2010s, around 40% of those employed in\nurban areas worked outside of agriculture, but only around 20% in rural areas.\n\nThe Papua New Guinean kina is managed through a crawling peg, with its value\nheavily impacted by the country's natural resource exports. The largest\nbilateral trade partner is Australia, followed by Japan, and then China.",

The biggest\nmine is a private gold mine on Lihir Island, which is followed by the state-\nrun Ok Tedi Mine, and then the Porgera Gold Mine. LNG exports began in 2014,\nalthough the opening of new projects has been delayed due to disputes\nregarding revenue sharing.\n\nIn 1999, mineral production accounted for 26.3% of gross domestic product.\nGovernment revenues and foreign exchange earning minerals. Copper and gold\nmines are currently in production at Porgera, Ok Tedi, Misima, Lihir, Simberi\nand Hidden Valley. As of 2014, talks of resuming mining operations in the\nPanguna mine have also resurfaced, with the Autonomous Bougainville Government\nand National Government of Papua New Guinea expressing interest in restarting\nmining operations in the area.\n\nNew nickel, copper and gold projects have been identified and are awaiting a\nrise in commodity prices to begin development. At early 2011, there are\nconfirmation that Mount Suckling project has found at least two new large\nhighly prospective porphyry bodies at Araboro Creek and Ioleu Creek. A\nconsortium led by Chevron is producing and exporting oil from the Southern\nHighlands Province of Papua New Guinea. In 2001, it expects to begin the\ncommercialization of the country's estimated 640 km3 (23 trillion cubic feet)\nof natural gas reserves through the construction of a gas pipeline from Papua\nNew Guinea to Queensland, Australia. The project was shelved.\n\nIn 2019, the country was the 8th largest world producer of cobalt, and the\n15th largest world producer of gold. In the production of silver, in 2017 the\ncountry produced 90 tons.\n\nMineral deposits account for 72% of export earnings.\n\nThe Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust\nbelt.\n\nThe first major gas project was the PNG LNG joint venture. ExxonMobil is\noperator of the joint venture, also comprising PNG company Oil Search, Santos,\nKumul Petroleum Holdings (Papua New Guinea's national oil and gas company), JX\nNippon Oil and Gas Exploration, the PNG government's Mineral Resources\nDevelopment Company and Petromin PNG Holdings. The project is an integrated\ndevelopment that includes gas production and processing facilities in the\nHela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of Papua New Guinea, including\nliquefaction and storage facilities (located northwest of Port Moresby) with\ncapacity of 6.9 million tonnes per year. There are over 700 kilometres (430\nmi) of pipelines connecting the facilities.[_non-primary source needed_] It is\nthe largest private-sector investment in the history of PNG. A second major\nproject is based on initial rights held by the French oil and gas major\nTotalEnergies and the U.S. company InterOil Corp. (IOC), which have partly\ncombined their assets after TotalEnergies agreed in December 2013 to purchase\n61.3% of IOC's Antelope and Elk gas field rights, with the plan to develop\nthem starting in 2016, including the construction of a liquefaction plant to\nallow export of LNG. TotalEnergies has separately another joint operating\nagreement with Oil Search.\n\nFurther gas and mineral projects are proposed (including the large Wafi-Golpu\ncopper-gold mine), with extensive exploration ongoing across the\ncountry.[_failed verification_]"

Agricultural\nexport of commodities such as copra, copra oil, rubber, tea, cocoa, and coffee\nhave not grown. However, the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations to\nproduce palm oil has become a significant and growing source of employment and\nincome. Overall the country produces 1.6% of global palm oil, and 1% of global\ncoffee. While not the largest sector of the economy, agriculture provides the\nmost employment, at around 85% of all jobs.\n\nNearly 40% of the population are subsistence farmers, living relatively\nindependently of the cash economy.

Most is carried out through simple rainfed\nsurface irrigation, with specific techniques varying by location. Taro is a\nhistorical crop, although the introduction of the now-staple sweet potato\nallowed for cultivation as high as 2,700 metres (8,900 ft). _Metroxylon_ (a\nsago palm) is another common crop.\n\nThe agricultural, forestry, and fishing sector accounts for most of the labour\nforce of PNG. Agriculture currently accounts for 25% of GDP and supports more\nthan 80% of the population. Most agriculture is subsistence, while cash crops\nare exported. The main crops by value are coffee, oil, cocoa, copra, tea,\nrubber, and sugar. The timber industry was not active in 1998, due to low\nworld prices, but rebounded in 1999. About 40% of the country is covered with\ntimber rich trees, and a domestic woodworking industry has been slow to\ndevelop. Fish exports are confined primarily to shrimp, although fishing boats\nof other nations catch tuna in Papua New Guinea waters under license.\n\nPapua New Guinea has the largest yam market in Asia.\n\nPapua New Guinea produced in 2021:\n\n* 3.0 million tons of palm oil (7th largest world producer);\n* 1.8 million tons of coconut (7th largest world producer);\n* 1.3 million tons of banana;\n* 1.1 million tons of fruits, fresh nes;\n* 699 thousand tons of sweet potato (17th largest world producer);\n* 371 thousand tons of yam;\n* 361 thousand tons of root and tubers;\n* 353 thousand tons of sugar cane;\n* 322 thousand tons of vegetable;\n* 278 thousand tons of taro;\n* 247 thousand tons of maize (green);\n* 156 thousand tons of cassava;\n* 109 thousand tons of berries nes;\n* 42 thousand tons of coffee;\n* 42 thousand tons of cocoa;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like\nnatural rubber (7.7 thousand tons) and tea (5.5 thousand tons).",

    "text": "The Ok Tedi Mine in southwestern Papua New Guinea\n\nOver 97% of the country designated as customary land, held by communities.\nMany such effective titles remain unregistered and effectively informal. Land\nregistration efforts have had very limited success.\n\nThe PNG legislature has enacted laws in which a type of tenure called\n\"customary land title\" is recognised, meaning that the traditional lands of\nthe indigenous peoples have some legal basis for inalienable tenure. This\ncustomary land notionally covers most of the usable land in the country (some\n97% of total land area); alienated land is either held privately under state\nlease or is government land. Freehold title (also known as fee simple) can\nonly be held by Papua New Guinean citizens.\n\nOnly some 3% of the land of Papua New Guinea is in private hands; this is\nprivately held under a 99-year state lease, or it is held by the State. There\nis virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically\nconverted to state leases when they are transferred between vendor and\npurchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional\nlandowners. The precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to\nanother. Many writers portray land as the communal ownership of traditional\nclans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land\nwhose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of\nextended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they\nhave recently died.[_citation needed_]\n\nThis is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development\nis identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners.\nDisputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often\ndevolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual\nrelations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property—usually\nland—cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the\ncustom of the deceased's people.[_citation needed_] The Lands Act was amended\nin 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the\nmanagement of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to\nenable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible\npartnerships over portions of their land if they seek to develop it for urban\nor rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more\nspecific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their\nmore specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a\nmajor issue in recent years has been a land grab, using, or rather misusing,\nthe Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special\nAgricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary\nland, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in almost all cases as a\nback-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for\nlogging—circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for\nsecuring Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements\nand be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners' approval).\nFollowing a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of\nInquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for\ninitial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.[_as of?_][_citation\nneeded_]"

(Papua New Guinea invested 0.03% of GDP in research and development in 2016.)\n\nIn 2016, women accounted for 33.2% of researchers in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAccording to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Papua New Guinea had the largest\nnumber of publications (110) among Pacific Island states in 2014, followed by\nFiji (106). Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea\nfocused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology.

    "text": "By mid-1999, Papua New Guinea's economy was in crisis. Although its\nagricultural sector had recovered from the 1997 drought and timber prices were\nrising as most Asian economies recovered from their 1998 slump, Papua New\nGuinea's foreign currency earnings suffered from low world mineral and\npetroleum prices. Estimates of minerals in exploration expenditure in 1999\nwere one-third of what was spent in 1997. The resulting lower foreign exchange\nearnings, capital flight, and general government mismanagement resulted in a\nprecipitous drop in the value of Papua New Guinea's currency, the kina,\nleading to a dangerous decrease in foreign currency reserves. The kina has\nfloated since 1994. Economic activity decreased in most sectors; imports of\nall kinds shrunk; and inflation, which had been over 21% in 1998, slowed to an\nestimated annual rate of 8% in 1999.\n\nCiting the previous government's failure to successfully negotiate acceptable\ncommercial loans or bond sales to cover its budget deficit, the government\nformed by Sir Mekere Morauta in July 1999 successfully requested emergency\nassistance from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With\nassistance from the Fund and the Bank, the government has made considerable\nprogress toward macroeconomic stabilization and economic reform.\n\nAs of 2019, although statistics show that an economic recovery is underway,\nPapua New Guinea's economy is still struggling.\n\nThe rugged terrain (including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and\nislands) and the high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other\nfactors (including law and order problems in some centres and the system of\ncustomary land title) make it difficult for outside developers. Local\ndevelopers are hindered by years of deficient investment in education, health,\nand access to finance.\n\nThe country's terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop\ntransportation infrastructure, resulting in air travel being the most\nefficient and reliable means of transportation. There are five highways,\nalthough only two go into the interior. Domestic shipping is limited. Overall\nhousing quality is low, with 15% of houses having a finished floor in the late\n2010s. In urban areas, 55% of houses were connected to electricity in 2016.\nRural areas saw only 10% connection, although this is a significant increase\nfrom 3% in 1996. Over half of urban houses had access to piped water, while\nonly 15% of rural houses did, although rural houses had more access to wells.\nThe average number of people per room was 2.5.\n\nThe Sirinumu Dam and Yonki Dam provide some hydropower. There is limited\nsewage treatment, even in the capital. Some is discharged directly into the\nocean, leading to issues with pollution.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta tried to restore integrity to state\ninstitutions, stabilise the kina, restore stability to the national budget,\nprivatise public enterprises where appropriate, and ensure ongoing peace on\nBougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended Bougainville's\nsecessionist unrest. The Morauta government had considerable success in\nattracting international support, specifically gaining the backing of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in securing development\nassistance loans.\n\nThe PNG government's long-term Vision 2050 and shorter-term policy documents,\nincluding the 2013 Budget and the 2014 Responsible Sustainable Development\nStrategy, emphasise the need for a more diverse economy, based upon\nsustainable industries and avoiding the effects of Dutch disease from major\nresource extraction projects undermining other industries. This occurred in\nmany countries experiencing oil or other mineral booms, notably in Western\nAfrica, undermining much of their agriculture sector, manufacturing and\ntourism, and with them broad-based employment prospects. Measures have been\ntaken to mitigate these effects, including through the establishment of a\nsovereign wealth fund, partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flows, but\nmuch will depend upon the readiness to make real reforms to effective use of\nrevenue, tackling rampant corruption and empowering households and businesses\nto access markets, services and develop a more buoyant economy, with lower\ncosts, especially for small to medium-sized enterprises.[_citation needed_]\nEconomic 'development' based on the extractive industries also carries\ndifficult consequences for local communities. One major project conducted\nthrough the PNG Department for Community Development suggested that other\npathways to sustainable development should be considered.\n\nThe Institute of National Affairs, a PNG independent policy think tank,\nprovides a report on the business and investment environment of Papua New\nGuinea every five years, based upon a survey of large and small, local and\noverseas companies, highlighting law and order problems and corruption, as the\nworst impediments, followed by the poor state of transport, power and\ncommunications infrastructure.[_non-primary source needed_]"
