    "text": "The **economy of Laos** is a lower-middle income developing economy. Being a\ncommunist state, the Lao economic model bears some resemblance to the Chinese\nand Vietnamese economies, in that it has implemented market-based economic\npractices while maintaining a degree of state control and welcoming foreign\ndirect investment.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, Laos established a Soviet-type planned economy. As\npart of economic restructuring that aimed to integrate Laos into the\nglobalized world market, the country underwent reforms called the \"New\nEconomic Mechanism\" in 1986 that decentralized government control and\nencouraged private enterprise alongside state-owned enterprises. As of 2007,\nLaos averaged 8% a year in GDP growth. It was forecasted that Laos would\nsustain at least 7% growth through 2019.\n\nThe key goals for the government included pursuing poverty reduction and\neducation for all children, with an initiative to become a \"land-linked\"\ncountry. This was showcased through the construction of the nearly $6 billion\nhigh-speed rail from Kunming, China to Vientiane, Laos. The country opened a\nstock exchange, the Lao Securities Exchange, in 2011, and has become a\nregional player in its role as a hydroelectric power supplier to its neighbors\nChina, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Lao economy relies on Foreign direct\ninvestment to attract capital from overseas. The long-term goal of the Lao\neconomy, as enshrined in the constitution, is economic development in the\ndirection of socialism.\n\nLaos has hydropower resources; the country has potential for hydro- and solar\npower. Excess electricity from hydropower is exported to other countries. The\ncountry relies on coal in its electricity production.",

    "text": "Seizure of power by the Communists resulted in the withdrawal of mainly\nAmerican external investment, on which the country had become dependent as a\nresult of the destruction of domestic capital during the Indochina Wars.\n\nWith the revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, in 1991,\nthe PDR Lao government reached an agreement with the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund on reforms. The government agreed to introduce\nfiscal and monetary reform, promote private enterprise and foreign investment,\nprivatize or close state firms, and strengthen banking. It agreed to maintain\na market exchange rate, reduce tariffs, and eliminate unneeded trade\nregulations. A liberal foreign investment code was enacted. Enforcement of\nintellectual property rights is governed by 2 Prime Minister's Decrees dating\nfrom 1995 and 2002.\n\nThe economy continues to be dominated by an agricultural sector operating\nlargely outside the money economy and in which the public sector continues to\nplay a dominant role. A number of private enterprises have been founded in\nindustries such as handicrafts, beer, coffee and tourism[_usurped_]. With\nUnited Nations, Japanese, and German support, a formerly state-controlled\nchamber of commerce aims to promote private business: the Lao National Chamber\nof Commerce and Industry and its provincial subdivisions.\n\nA round of state-owned enterprise reform in 2019 aims to ensure that the\nremaining SOEs become profitable ventures that are efficient and sustainable\nsources of income for the national treasury. These measures include closing\nunproductive enterprises, ensure businesses in which the state has investments\nare reformed into profitable ventures, and reduce corruption. As of 2019, the\nState-Owned Enterprise Development and Insurance Department of the Lao\ngovernment has 183 enterprises under its supervision.\n\nLaos faced an economic crisis in 2022. Caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and\nexternal debt primarily from China, it escalated into inflation and a debt\ncrisis, bringing the country to the brink of default. A World Bank report\nfinds that the economic instability \"largely results from low revenue and\naccumulated debt. There is moreover a need to improve the efficiency of public\nexpenditure and tackle the potential costs of state-owned enterprises and\npublic-private partnerships.” The Lao kip currency value has fallen and\ninflation remains higher than before the pandemic. The same World Bank report\nstates that \"the main factor in the kip’s falling value has been the lack of\nforeign currency available (...) a result of the need to repay large external\ndebts, despite some deferrals, and limited capital inflows.\" The per capita\nGDP of Laos has gone down from $2,595 in 2021 to $1,824 in 2023 because of the\nkip’s depreciation.",
