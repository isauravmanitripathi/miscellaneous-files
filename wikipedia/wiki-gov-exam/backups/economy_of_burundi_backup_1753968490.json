    "text": "Little industry exists except for the processing of agricultural exports.\nAlthough potential wealth in petroleum, nickel, copper, and other natural\nresources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented\nmeaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by\nBurundi's distance from the sea and high transport costs. Lake Tanganyika\nremains an important trading point. The trade embargo, lifted in 1999,\nnegatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has\nsuffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of\nperhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods,\nmedicines, and electricity remain in short supply.\n\nBurundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external\ndebt totaling $1.247 billion (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely\nunsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World\nBank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign\nexchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international\ntransactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.\n\nGoat rearing has been promoted as a source of income for rural-dwelling\nBurundians.\n\nIMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the\noutbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for\npotential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the\nintroduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and\nservices. Other serious problems include the state's role in the economy, the\nquestion of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.\n\nTo protest the 1996 coup by President Pierre Buyoya, neighboring countries\nimposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never\nofficially ratified by the United Nations Security Council, most countries\nrefrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the United\nStates also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional\nembargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in\nadvancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.\n\nIn an article titled \"The Blood Cries Out,\" _Foreign Policy (FP)_ reported\nthat the Burundian population growth rate is 2.5 percent per year, more than\ndouble the average global pace, and that a Burundian woman has on average 6.3\nchildren, nearly triple the international fertility rate. _FP_ further\nreported that \"The vast majority of Burundians rely on subsistence farming,\nbut under the weight of a booming population and in the long-standing absence\nof coherent policies governing land ownership, many people barely have enough\nearth to sustain themselves.\" In 2014, the average size for a farm was about\none acre. _FP_ added that \"The consequence is remarkable scarcity: In the 2013\nGlobal Hunger Index, Burundi had the severest hunger and malnourishment rates\nof all 120 countries ranked.\""

    "text": "Burundi is one of the least electrified countries in the world, only about 10%\nof the country's population has access to electricity. In 2022, the country\nproduced a total of 565 GWh of electricity, 50% of which was generated via\nfossil fuels while the other 50% was generated via renewables. Oil is the main\nfossil fuel in use, while the renewable energy is sourced primarily from\nhydropower and to a much lesser degree from solar energy as well as bioenergy.\nThis domestic production however does not fulfil Burundi's demand and it\nimports sizeable amount of energy from neighbouring countries.\n\nThe opening of the Rusumo Hydroelectric Power Station in 2023 was a boon to\nthe country as Burundi receives 27 MW of electricity generated in it. The\npower station combined with improved transmission cables allowed Burundi to\nprovide the capital city of Gitega with a more reliable and consistent power\nsupply. At the same time it allowed the government to decommission the old\noil-fired power station that supplied the city before and save over two\nmillion USD in costs. This project was a part of a wider international aid-\nassisted initiative in Burundi to pursue low-carbon electrification and\nimproving access to electricity across the country. The government also\npursues a much greater domestic hydropower project, a power station located in\nRubrizi with the help of extensive funding by the African Development Bank and\nthe European Union. The power station, scheduled to be completed in December\n2024, is designed to generate 160 MW of electricity, making it the largest\npower station in Burundi. Together with associated improvements to\ntransmission in infrastructure, it's predicted to provide electricity access\nto 7% of the country's population."
