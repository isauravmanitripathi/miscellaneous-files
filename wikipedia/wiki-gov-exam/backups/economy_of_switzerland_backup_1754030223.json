Before that time, the\ncity-cantons of Zürich, Geneva, and Basel in particular began to develop\neconomically based on industry and trade, while the rural regions of\nSwitzerland remained poor and underdeveloped. While a workshop system had been\nin existence throughout the early modern period, the production of machines\nbegan in 1801 in St. Gallen, with the third generation of machines imported\nfrom Great Britain. But in Switzerland, hydraulic power was often used instead\nof steam engines because of the country's mountainous topography and lack of\nsignificant deposits of coal. By 1814, hand weaving had been mostly replaced\nby the power loom. Both tourism and banking began to develop as economic\nfactors at about the same time. While Switzerland was primarily rural, the\ncities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused\nespecially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were\nthe leading industry. In 1888, women made up 44% of wage earners. Nearly half\nthe women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second\nlargest job category. The proportion of women in the workforce was higher\nbetween 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nRailways played a major part in industrialization; the first railway opened in\n1847, between Zürich and Baden.

    "text": "The industrial sector began to grow in the 19th century with a laissez-faire\nindustrial/trade policy, Switzerland's emergence as one of the most prosperous\nnations in Europe, sometimes termed the \"Swiss miracle\", was a development of\nthe mid 19th to early 20th centuries, among other things tied to the role of\nSwitzerland during the World Wars.\n\nSwitzerland's total energy consumption, which was dropping from the mid 1910s\nto the early 1920s, started to increase again in the early 1920s. It stagnated\nduring the 1930s before falling again during the early 1940s; but rapid growth\nstarted once again in the mid 1940s.\n\nIn the 1940s, particularly during World War II, the economy profited from the\nincreased export and delivery of weapons to Germany, France, the United\nKingdom, and other European countries. However, Switzerland's energy\nconsumption decreased rapidly. The co-operation of the banks with the Nazis\n(although they also co-operated extensively with the British and French) and\ntheir commercial relations with the Axis powers during the war were later\nsharply criticised, resulting in a short period of international isolation of\nSwitzerland. Switzerland's production facilities were largely undamaged by the\nwar, and afterwards both imports and exports grew rapidly.\n\nIn the 1950s, annual GDP growth averaged 5% and Switzerland's energy\nconsumption nearly doubled. Coal lost its rank as Switzerland's primary energy\nsource, as other imported fossil fuels, such as crude and refined oil and\nnatural and refined gas, increased.\n\nIn the 1960s, annual GDP growth averaged 4% and Switzerland's total energy\nconsumption nearly doubled again. By the end of the decade oil provided over\nthree-quarters of Switzerland's energy.\n\nIn the 1970s the GDP growth rate gradually declined from a peak of 6.5% in\n1970; GDP then contracted by 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became\nincreasingly dependent on oil imported from its main suppliers, the OPEC\ncartel. The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy\nconsumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1978. In 1974 there were\nthree nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited as a\nresult of the oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew again, although\nSwitzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a\nshort-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption. In 1970 industry\nstill employed about 46% of the labor force, but during the economic recession\nof the 1970s the services sector grew to dominate the national economy. By\n1970 17.2% of the population and about one quarter of the work force were\nforeign nationals, though job losses during the economic recession decreased\nthis number.\n\nIn the 1980s, Switzerland's economy contracted by 1.3% in 1982 but grew\nsubstantially for the rest of the decade, with annual GDP growth between about\n3% and 4%, apart from 1986 and 1987 when growth decreased to 1.9% and 1.6%\nrespectively.\n\nSwitzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the\nweakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a\nthree-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The\ncontraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and\nexport growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase\n(only 0.6% annually) in GDP.\n\nAfter enjoying unemployment rates lower than 1% before 1990, the three-year\nrecession also caused the unemployment rate to rise to its all-time peak of\n5.3% in 1997. In 2008, Switzerland was in second place among European\ncountries with populations above one million in terms of nominal and\npurchasing power parity GDP per capita, behind Norway (see list). Several\ntimes in the 1990s, real wages decreased since nominal wages could not keep up\nwith inflation. However, beginning in 1997, a global resurgence in currency\nmovement provided the necessary stimulus to the Swiss economy. It slowly\ngained momentum, and peaked in the year 2000 with 3.7% growth in real terms.",

    "text": "In the early 2000s recession, being so closely linked to the economies of\nWestern Europe and the United States, Switzerland could not escape the\nslowdown in these countries. After the worldwide stock market crashes in the\nwake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there were more announcements of false\nenterprise statistics[_clarification needed_] and exaggerated managers' wages.\nThe rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.2% in 2001; 0.4% in 2002; and minus 0.2%\nin 2003. This economic slowdown had a noticeable impact on the labour market.\n\nMany companies announced mass dismissals and thus the unemployment rate rose\nfrom its low of 1.6% in September 2000 to a peak of 4.3% in January 2004,\nalthough well below the European Union (EU) rate of 9.2% at the end of 2004.\n\nOn 10 November 2002 the economics magazine _Cash_ suggested five measures for\npolitical and economic institutions to implement to revive the Swiss economy:\n\n1\\. Private consumption should be promoted with decent wage increases. In\naddition to that, families with children should get discounts on their health\ninsurance.\n\n2\\. Switzerland's national bank should revive investments by lowering interest\nrates. Besides that, monetary institutions should increasingly credit\nconsumers[_clarification needed_] and offer cheaper land to be built on.\n\nEuro to Swiss Franc exchange rate. In 2022, the Swiss National Bank reported a\nrecord loss of CHF 132 billion ($142 billion), mostly on its holdings of the\nEuro currency.\n\n3\\. Switzerland's national bank was asked to devalue the Swiss Franc,\nespecially compared to the Euro.\n\n4\\. The government should implement the anti-cyclical measure of increasing\nbudget deficits. Government spending should increase in the infrastructure and\neducation sectors. Lowering taxes would make sense in order to promote private\nhousehold consumption.\n\n5\\. Flexible work schedules should be instituted, thus avoiding low demand\ndismissals.\n\nThese measures were applied with successful results while the government\nstrove for the _Magical Hexagon_ of full employment, social equality, economic\ngrowth, environmental quality, positive trade balance and price stability. The\nrebound which started in mid-2003 saw growth rate growth rate averaging 3%\n(2004 and 2005 saw a GDP growth of 2.5% and 2.6% respectively; for 2006 and\n2007, the rate was 3.6%). In 2008, GDP growth was modest in the first half of\nthe year while declining in the last two quarters. Because of the base effect,\nreal growth came to 1.9%. While it contracted 1.9% in 2009, the economy\nstarted to pick up in Q3 and by the second quarter of 2010, it had surpassed\nits previous peak. Growth for 2010 was 2.6%\n\nThe stock market collapse of 2007-2009 deeply affected investment income\nearned abroad. This translated to a substantial fall in the surplus of the\ncurrent account balance. In 2006, Switzerland recorded a 15.1% per GDP\nsurplus. It went down to 9.1% in 2007 and further dropped to 1.8% in 2008. It\nrecovered in 2009 and 2010 with a surplus of 11.9% and 14.6% respectively.\nUnemployment peaked in December 2009 at 4.4%.

In the wake of the Swiss voters' rejection\nof the European Economic Area Agreement in 1992, the Swiss Government set its\nsights on negotiating bilateral economic agreements with the EU. Four years of\nnegotiations culminated in _Bilaterals_ , a cross-platform agreement covering\nseven sectors: research, public procurement, technical barriers to trade,\nagriculture, civil aviation, land transport, and the free movement of persons.\nParliament officially endorsed the Bilaterals in 1999 and it was approved by\ngeneral referendum in May 2000. The agreements, which were then ratified by\nthe European Parliament and the legislatures of its member states, entered\ninto force on June 1, 2002. The Swiss government then embarked on a second\nround of negotiations, called the _Bilaterals II_ , approved by the Swiss\nelectorate on 5 June 2005, which further strengthens the country's economic\nties with the organisation.\n\nSwitzerland has since brought most of their practices into conformity with\nEuropean Union policies and norms in order to maximise the country's\ninternational competitiveness. While most of the EU policies are not\ncontentious, police and judicial cooperation to international law enforcement\nand the taxation of savings are controversial, mainly because of possible side\neffects on bank secrecy.\n\nSwiss and EU finance ministers agreed in June 2003 that Swiss banks would levy\na withholding tax on EU citizens' savings income. The tax would increase\ngradually to 35% by 2011, with 75% of the funds being transferred to the EU.\nRecent estimates value EU capital inflows to Switzerland to $8.3 billion."
