    "text": "The **economy of theCentral African Republic** is $2.321 billion by gross\ndomestic product as of 2019, even lower than much smaller countries such as\nBarbados with an estimated annual per capita income of just $529 as measured\nnominally in 2024.\n\nSparsely populated and landlocked, the Central African Republic is\noverwhelmingly agrarian. The vast bulk of the population engages in\nsubsistence farming and 55% of the country's GDP derives from agriculture.\nSubsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the\neconomy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the\npopulation living in outlying areas.\n\nPrincipal food crops include cassava, peanuts, sorghum, millet, maize, sesame,\nand plantains. Principal cash crops for export include cotton, coffee, and\ntobacco. Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond\nindustry for nearly 54%. Central African Republic is a least developed country\naccording to United Nations."

    "text": "Though periodically unusable, the Oubangui River is nonetheless an important\ntransportation route.\n\nMuch of the country's limited electrical supply is provided by hydroelectric\nplants located in Boali. Fuel supplies must be barged in via the Oubangui\nRiver or trucked overland through Cameroon, resulting in frequent shortages of\ngasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The C.A.R.'s transportation and communication\nnetwork is limited. The country has only 429 kilometers of paved road, limited\ninternational, and no domestic air service, and does not possess a railroad.\n\nRiver traffic on the Oubangui River is impossible from April to July, and\nconflict in the region has sometimes prevented shipments from moving between\nKinshasa and Bangui. The telephone system functions, albeit imperfectly. Four\nradio stations operate in the C.A.R., as well as one television station.\nNumerous newspapers and pamphlets are published on a regular basis, and one\ncompany provides Internet access."

    "text": "The country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources; meanwhile,\nforestry remains an important contributor to the C. A. R. economy.\n\nIn 2014, the country exported 59.3 million US dollars of forest products such\nas timber. This accounts for 40% of total export earnings in the C.A.R.\n\nForeign companies are involved in illegal logging activities in the country.\nFor example, in 2013, the French _Industrie forestière de Batalimo_ (IFB),\nLebanese _Société d’exploitation forestière centrafricaine_ (SEFCA) and\nChinese Vicwood Group reportedly made illegal tax payments totalling €3,7\nmillion to the Ministry of Finance under the presidency of Michel Djotodia, as\nwell as monthly payments to Séléka fighters to safeguard their installations.\nSEFCA also paid an additional \"advance\" of €380,876 directly to Djotodia's\ngovernment. According to a report from the UN Security Council, \"illegal\nartisanal exploitation surged in non-attributed forest areas\" under the\nDjotodia government, while logging trucks were \"systematically subjected to\nillegal tax levying\". In 2014, the same companies paid approximately €127,864\nto Anti-balaka militias at road checkpoints.\n\nThese illegal timber exploits continued in more recent years. The CEMAC banned\nraw timber exports in January 2022, but the Central African Republic failed to\nhonor this ban. The ongoing timber trade has been linked since 2021 to a\n\"tripartite agreement\" between government officials, Wagner Group mercenaries,\nand a Russian company from Saint Petersburg named _Bois Rouge_ , with Wagner\nhaving branched out into the timber industry and logging a forest in Lobaye.\nThe Wagner mercenaries reportedly invaded and \"emptied\" entire villages to log\ntimber at virtually no cost, creating a potential revenue of up to $890\nmillion on international markets."

    "text": "The country has rich natural resources in the form of diamonds, gold, uranium,\nand other minerals. Diamonds constitute one of the most important exports of\nthe CAR, frequently accounting for 20-30% of export revenues, but an estimated\n30-50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country\nclandestinely.[_citation needed_] There may be petroleum deposits along the\ncountry's northern border with Chad. (Two billion barrels of oil are present\nin private estimates).[_citation needed_]\n\nDiamonds are the only of these mineral resources currently being developed;\nreported sales of largely uncut diamonds made up close to 60% of the CAR's\nexport earnings as of 2001. Industry contributes less than 20% of the\ncountry's GDP, with artesian diamond mining, breweries, and sawmills making up\nthe bulk of the sector. Services account for 25% of GDP, largely because of\ngovernment bureaucracy and high transportation costs arising from the\ncountry's landlocked position."

    "text": "74% (2013) of the population in the Central African Republic works in the\nagriculture industry, so Central African Republic's economy is dominated by\nthe cultivation and sale of foodcrops such as yams, cassava, peanuts, maize,\nsorghum, millet, sesame, and plantains. The importance of foodcrops over\nexported cash crops is illustrated by the fact that the total production of\ncassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000\nand 300,000 tons a year, while the production of cotton, the principal\nexported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year.\n\nFoodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the\nprincipal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more\nincome from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash\ncrops such as cotton or coffee. Many rural and urban women also transform some\nfoodcrops into alcoholic drinks such as sorghum beer or hard liquor and derive\nconsiderable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived\nfrom the sale of foods and alcohol is not \"on the books\" and thus is not\nconsidered in calculating per capita income, which is one reason why official\nfigures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.\n\nThe per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $400 a year,\nsaid to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on\nreported sales of exports and largely ignores the more important but\nunregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcohol, diamonds, ivory,\nbushmeat, and traditional medicines, for example. The informal economy of the\nCAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.\n\nCentral African Republic produced in 2019:\n\n* 730 thousand tons of cassava;\n* 511 thousand tons of yam (7th largest producer in the world);\n* 143 thousand tons of peanut;\n* 140 thousand tons of taro;\n* 138 thousand tons of banana;\n* 120 thousand tons of sugar cane;\n* 90 thousand tons of maize;\n* 87 thousand tons of plantain;\n* 75 thousand tons of vegetable;\n* 36 thousand tons of orange;\n* 30 thousand tons of sorghum;\n* 21 thousand tons of cotton;\n* 19 thousand tons of pumpkin;\n* 17 thousand tons of pineapple;\n* 12 thousand tons of mango;\n* 10 thousand tons of millet;\n* 10 thousand tons of coffee;\n* 8.5 thousand tons of avocado;\n* 6.7 thousand tons of sesame seed;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products."

    "text": "The financial sector of the CAR, the smallest in the CEMAC, plays a limited\nrole in supporting economic growth. Suffering from weak market infrastructure\nand legal and judicial frameworks, the financial system remains small,\nundeveloped, and dominated by commercial banks. Because of economic and\nsecurity concerns, financial institutions, and particularly microfinance\ninstitutions (MFIs), have consolidated their business in the capital, Bangui,\nover the past few years.\n\nWith less than 1% of the total population holding a bank account, access to\nfinancial services is extremely limited in the CAR. Microfinance accounts only\nfor 1% of the total credit facilities, serving 0.5 percent of the population.\nLow levels of mobile penetration – which stand at 30%, a significantly lower\npercentage than in the rest of the continent – dampen the potential expansion\nof access to financial services through mobile technology. In April 2022, the\ncountry announced that it will adopt the cryptocurrency bitcoin as legal\ntender."

    "text": "A bricklayer in Paoua, Central African Republic.\n\nThe CAR is heavily dependent upon multilateral foreign aid and the presence of\nnumerous NGO's which provide numerous services which the government fails to\nprovide. As one UNDP official put it, the CAR is a country \"sous serum,\" or a\ncountry hooked up to an IV (Mehler 2005:150). The presence of numerous foreign\npersonnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and refugee\ncamps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central\nAfricans.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn the 40 years since independence, the CAR has made slow progress toward\neconomic development. Economic mismanagement, poor infrastructure, a limited\ntax base, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led\nto deficits in both its budget and external trade. Its debt burden is\nconsiderable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita gross national\nproduct over the last 40 years.\n\nImportant constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked\nposition, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a\nlegacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the\ncurrencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed\neffects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports\nincreased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in\n1995.\n\nMilitary rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread\ndestruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the\ngovernment and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and\npolitical representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and\nreduced tax revenues for the government.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an Extended Structure\nAdjustment Facility in 1998. The government has set targets of annual 5%\ngrowth and 25% inflation for 2000–2001. Structural adjustment programs with\nthe World Bank and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the\nagriculture, livestock, and transportation sectors have had limited impact.\nThe World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate\nexclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the\neconomy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating\npoverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been\nprivatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify\nlabor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central\nAfrican Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and\ninvestment codes."
