Latvia is a member of the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) since 1999, a member of the European Union since 2004, a member of the\nEurozone since 2014 and a member of the OECD since 2016. Latvia is ranked the\n14th in the world by the Ease of Doing Business Index prepared by the World\nBank Group. According to the Human Development Report 2023/24 by the United\nNations Development Programme, has a HDI score of a 0.879 (2022 data). Due to\nits geographical location, transit services are highly developed, along with\ntimber and wood processing, agriculture and food products, and manufacturing\nof machinery and electronic devices.\n\nLatvia's economy has had rapid GDP growth of more than 10% per year during\n2006–07, but entered a severe recession in 2009 as a result of an\nunsustainable current account deficit, collapse of the real estate market, and\nlarge debt exposure amid the softening world economy. Triggered by the\ncollapse of Parex Bank, the second largest bank, GDP decreased by almost 18%\nin 2009, and the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and other\ninternational donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as\npart of an agreement to defend the currency's peg to the euro in exchange for\nthe government's commitment to stringent austerity measures. In 2011 Latvia\nachieved GDP growth by 5.5% and thus Latvia again was among the fastest\ngrowing economies in the European Union. The IMF/EU program successfully\nconcluded in December 2011.\n\nPrivatization is mostly complete, except for some of the large state-owned\nutilities. Export growth contributed to the economic recovery, however, the\nbulk of the country's economic activity is in the services sector.",

    "text": "For centuries under Hanseatic and German influence and then during its inter-\nwar independence, Latvia used its geographic location as an important\neast–west commercial and trading centre. Industry served local markets, while\ntimber, paper and agricultural products were Latvia's main exports.\n\nPrior to World War I, Latvia was an advanced manufacturing hub within the\nRussian Empire, primarily serving the Russian market. After attaining\nindependence in 1918, Latvia lost its status as an advanced manufacturing hub.\nLatvia sought in the interwar period to become an international exporter of\nfood and to re-industrialize. Latvia experienced growth in GDP per capita\nduring the interwar period, although some economic historians have argued that\nthere was stagnation in the period of the authoritarian Karlis Ulmanis regime\n(1934–1940).\n\nAfter reestablishing its independence, Latvia proceeded with market-oriented\nreforms, albeit at a measured pace. Its freely traded currency, the lat, was\nintroduced in 1993 and held steady, or appreciated, against major world\ncurrencies. Inflation was reduced from 958.6% in 1992 to 25% by 1995 and 1.4%\nby 2002.\n\nAfter contracting substantially between 1991 and 1995, the economy steadied in\nlate 1994, led by a recovery in light industry and a boom in commerce and\nfinance. This recovery was interrupted twice, first by a banking crisis and\nthe bankruptcy of _Banka Baltija_ , Latvia's largest bank, in 1995 and second\nby a severe crisis in the financial system of neighbouring Russia in 1998.\nAfter 2000, Latvian GDP grew by 6–8% a year for 4 consecutive years. Latvia's\nstate budget was balanced in 1997 but the 1998 Russian financial crisis\nresulted in large deficits, which were reduced from 4% of GDP in 1999 to 1.8%\nin 2003. These deficits were smaller than in most of the other countries\njoining the European Union in 2004.\n\nUntil the middle of 2008, Latvia had the fastest developing economy in Europe.\nIn 2003, GDP growth was 7.5% and inflation was 2.9%. The centrally planned\nsystem of the Soviet period was replaced with a structure based on free-market\nprinciples. In 2005, private sector share in GDP was 70%. Recovery in light\nindustry and Riga's emergence as a regional financial and commercial centre\noffset shrinkage of the state-owned industrial sector and agriculture. The\nofficial unemployment figure was held steady in the 7%–10% range.",

    "text": "The 2008 financial crisis severely disrupted the Latvian economy, primarily as\na result of the easy credit bubble that began building up during 2004. The\nbubble burst leading to a rapidly weakening economy, resulting in a budget,\nwage and unemployment crisis. Latvia had the worst economic performance in\n2009, with annual growth rate averaging −18%.\n\nThe Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second\nhalf of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and\nunrealistic inflation of real estate values. The national account deficit for\n2007, for example, represented more than 22% of the GDP for the year while\ninflation was running at 10%. By 2009 unemployment rose to 23% and was the\nhighest in the EU.\n\nPaul Krugman, the Nobel Laureate in economics for 2008, wrote in his _New York\nTimes_ Op-Ed column for 15 December 2008:\n\n_\"The acutest problems are on Europe's periphery, where many smaller economies\nare experiencing crises strongly reminiscent of past crises in Latin America\nand Asia: Latvia is the new Argentina\"._\n\nBy August 2009, Latvia's GDP had fallen by 20% year on year, with Standard &\nPoor's predicting a further 16% contraction to come. The International\nMonetary Fund suggested a devaluation of Latvia's currency, but the European\nUnion objected to this, on the grounds that the majority of Latvia's debt was\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Financial economist Michael Hudson has\nadvocated for redenominating foreign currency liabilities in Latvian lats\nbefore devaluing.\n\nHowever, by 2010 there were indications that Latvia's policy of internal\ndevaluation was successful."

    "text": "Privatisation in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously\nstate-owned small and medium companies have been privatized, leaving only a\nsmall number of politically sensitive large state companies. In particular,\nthe country's main energy and utility company, Latvenergo remains state-owned\nand there are no plans to privatize it. The government also holds minority\nshares in Ventspils Nafta oil transit company and the country's main telecom\ncompany Lattelecom but it plans to relinquish its shares in the near future.\n\nForeign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in\nnorth-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including\nland sales to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's\ntotal foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in\n1999. In the same year, the United States exported $58.2 million of goods and\nservices to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic\ninstitutions like the World Trade Organization, OECD, and the European Union,\nLatvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995 with a 4-year transition\nperiod. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment,\ntrade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation."
