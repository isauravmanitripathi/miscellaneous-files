Please review the\nlead layout guide and help improve the lead of this article if you can. _(\nNovember 2023)__(Learn how and when to remove this message)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Turkmenistan** continues to recover from the 2014 downturn in\nhydrocarbon prices, but remains \"in the grip of its worst economic crisis\nsince the immediate post-independence period, driven in part by low gas\nprices, the suspension of gas exports to Russia between 2016 and 2019...and\npoor harvests.\" Former President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow at a session of the\nCabinet of Ministers on 11 March 2021, called the rate of GDP growth\nunsatisfactory. When discussing the 2021 government budget, he noted that 2021\nwould be \"as difficult\" a year as 2020 had been. According to the 2020\nInvestment Climate Statement of the US Department of State, Turkmenistan's\neconomy depends heavily on the production and export of natural gas, oil,\npetrochemicals and, to a lesser degree, cotton, wheat, and textiles. The\neconomy is still recovering from a deep recession that followed the late 2014\ncollapse in global energy prices. The current investment climate is considered\nhigh risk for US foreign direct investment.\n\nTurkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture in\nirrigated areas, and huge gas and oil resources. In terms of natural gas\nreserves, as of 2020 it is ranked 4th in the world. Turkmenistan's two largest\nagricultural crops are cotton, most of which is produced for export, and\nwheat, most of which is domestically consumed. Turkmenistan is among the top\nten producers of cotton in the world.",

    "text": "_See alsoTurkmenistan / Natural gas and export routes_\n\nTurkmenistan's natural gas reserves are estimated at 50 trillion cubic meters.\n\nTurkmenistan's major gas deposits were discovered in its central and eastern\nareas in the 1940s and 1950s, and in the 1980s the republic became the second\nlargest producer of gas in the Soviet Union, behind the Russian SFSR. During\nthe Soviet era gas was exported mainly to other Soviet republics, as\nTurkmenistan steadily increased delivery from about 9.2 million m³ in 1940 to\nabout 234 million m³ in 1960 and about 51 billion m³ in 1975. This export was\nunder centralised control, and most of the export revenue was absorbed into\nthe Soviet central budget.\n\nThis changed in 1991, when Turkmenistan gained independence and established\nfull control over gas export and export revenues. However, Soviet-era\npipelines dictated that much of the gas go to the Caucasus, Russia and\nUkraine. In the 1990s many of Turkmenistan's gas customers in the CIS failed\nto pay on time or negotiated barter deals. In the mid-1990s Turkmenistan\nstopped delivering gas to some CIS members, citing failure to pay and\nunprofitable barter deals. At the same time, the government tried to attract\ninvestments in building gas pipelines via Iran to Turkey and Western Europe\nvia Afghanistan to Pakistan. Neither deal went through due to an unfavourable\nregional security environment and high costs; inflation and the budget deficit\nrose but privatisation was resisted.\n\nIn the late 1990s the government renegotiated its export and price\narrangements with Gazprom and renewed deliveries to Georgia, Ukraine, and some\nother countries. It also opened its first pipeline not to pass through Russia,\nthe Korpezhe-Kurt Kui Pipeline.\n\nOn 14 December 2009, the Central Asia–China gas pipeline was opened, and\nTurkmenistan began delivering large volumes of natural gas to the China\nNational Petroleum Corporation. Combined design capacity of Lines A, B, and C\nof this pipeline system is 55 billion cubic meters per annum (bcma), of which\nTurkmenistan's quota was initially 35 bcma. In 2023, the Turkmenistan Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs stated that Turkmenistan's quota on this pipeline system\nwas 40 bcma. By 2015 Turkmenistan was delivering approximately 35 bcma to\nChina, counterbalancing declining exports to Russia, which ended on 1 January\n2016. Russia had earlier restricted its imports to about 10 bcma, and then 5\nbcma. Russian purchases resumed, albeit in smaller quantities, in 2019.\n\nSmall-volume sales of an estimated 12 bcma to Iran halted on 1 January 2017,\nwhen Turkmenistan unilaterally cut off supplies over payment arrears. Ashgabat\nclaimed Tehran owed some $1.8 billion for supplies delivered nearly 10 years\nbefore. In March 2025 Turkmenistan began selling natural gas to Turkey via a\nTurkmenistan-Iran, Iran-Turkey swap with the goal of shipping 1.3 bcm by the\nend of the year.\n\nIn January–November 2020, Turkmenistan extracted 62.3 billion m3 of natural\ngas, of which, according to one source, it exported 31 billion. The state-\ncontrolled official media reported in February 2024 natural gas production in\ncalendar year 2023 as 80.6187 billion cubic meters.\n\nOne observes in the table below that production and exports peaked in 2008 and\ndramatically decreased in 2009. This was due an explosion in the Central\nAsia–Center gas pipeline system in April 2009 for which Turkmenistan blamed\nGazprom. Natural gas exports include pipeline gas directly to China and\nRussia, and to Azerbaijan via a swap with Iran, plus liquid petroleum gas\nshipped by rail and truck to Afghanistan.\n\nCeremony on completion of the Turkmen section of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\nPakistan-India natural gas pipeline **Turkmenistan Production, Consumption,\nand Exports of Natural Gas**\nbillion cubic meters per annum (bcma)\nSource: BP Statistical Review  Year | Production | Consumption | Exports | Exports\nto Russia | Exports\nto China | Exports\nto Iran\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n2005 | 57.0 | 16.1 | 40.9 | 35.1 | 0 | 5.8\n2008 | 66.1 | 20.5 | 45.6 | 39.1 | 0 | 6.5\n2009 | 36.4 | 19.9 | 16.7 | 10.7 | 0 | 5.8\n2010 | 42.4 | 22.6 | 19.7 | 9.7 | 3.5 | 6.5\n2011 | 59.5 | 25.0 | 34.5 | 10.1 | 14.3 | 10.2\n2012 | 62.3 | 23.3 | 41.1 | 9.9 | 21.3 | 9.0\n2013 | 62.3 | 22.3 | 40.1 | 9.9 | 24.4 | 4.7\n2014 | 63.5 | 20.0 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n2015 | 65.9 | 25.4 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n2016 | 63.2 | 25.1 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n2017 | 58.7 | 24.8 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n2018 | 61.5 | 28.4 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n2019 | 63.2 | 31.5 | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a\n\nIn February 2022, Turkmenistan was identified as an ultra-emitter of methane\nby the European Space Agency's satellite-based TROPOspheric Monitoring\nInstrument, with the value of lost methane equalling about US$6 billion per\nyear."

The\ntop crop in terms of area planted is wheat (761 thousand hectares in 2019),\nfollowed by cotton (551 thousand hectares in 2019). In recent years state\npolicy makers have increased the range of crops with the aim of making\nTurkmenistan self-sufficient in food. In the post-Soviet era, the area planted\nto grains (mainly wheat) has nearly tripled. However, most agricultural land\nis of poor quality and requires irrigation. Turkmenistan's irrigation\ninfrastructure and water-use policies have not responded efficiently to this\nneed. Irrigation in areas distant from natural rivers depends mainly on the\ndecrepit Karakum Canal, which carries water across Turkmenistan from the Amu\nDarya to near Bereket. The Dostluk Dam, opened at Sarahs on the border with\nIran in 2005, has increased available irrigation water and improved\nefficiency. Plans call for a similar dam on the Atrek River.\n\nDuring the 2020 season, Turkmenistan reportedly produced roughly 1.5 million\ntons of raw cotton. Prior to imposition of a ban on export of raw cotton in\nOctober 2018, Turkmenistan exported raw cotton to Russia, Iran, South Korea,\nUnited Kingdom, China, Indonesia, Turkey, Ukraine, Singapore and the Baltic\nstates. Beginning in 2019, the Turkmenistan government shifted focus to export\nof cotton yarn and finished textiles and garments.\n\nPrivate farmers grow most of Turkmenistan's fruits and vegetables (chiefly\ntomatoes, watermelons, grapes, and onions), but all production phases of the\nmain cash crops—grain and cotton—remain under state control. In 2006 grain\ncrop failures led to steadily increasing bread lines and reinstatement of a\nrationing system in most regions. At the root of those failures was a culture\nof falsifying output figures together with poor administration of the sector.\n\nSince 2018, independent media have reported food shortages in the country,\nwith hundreds of people queuing for hours to buy bread and flour. Despite\nofficial government figures indicating good harvests, independent media report\nlow output due to drought and mismanagement, and that shortages of flour and\nbread have reappeared."

In 2012, around\n7,000 tractors, 5,000 cotton cultivators, 2,200 seeders, and other machines,\nmainly procured from Belarus and the United States, were used.\n\nJohn Deere and Case IH each began selling farm machinery in Turkmenistan in\n1994. Claas combines were first used for grain harvesting in Turkmenistan in\n2011. Belarus tractors, in use since Soviet times, continue to be popular due\nto competitive pricing and deep familiarity with the product line.\nTurkmenistan also buys cotton harvesters from Uzbekistan.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020 Claas delivered 1,000 Tucano 420 grain combines, 800\nAxion 850 plowing tractors, and 1,550 Axos 340 tractors. In the 2017 and 2018\ncrop years John Deere delivered 440 Model 9970 cotton harvesters, and between\n2019 and 2020 another 600."

According to Chinese Customs data, the value of Chinese imports of\nnatural gas from Turkmenistan fell from US$8,686,022,768 in 2019 to\nUS$6,071,165,273 in 2020 due to a combination of reduced Chinese import\nvolumes and falling hydrocarbon prices. Crude oil and refined petroleum\nproducts accounted for another US$3 billion of exports in 2019, followed by\nUS$123.6 million for cotton textiles. Among imports, major categories in 2019\nwere machinery (US$1.5 billion), base metals (US$968.3 million), chemicals\n(US$682.3 million), vehicles (US$453.5 million), and plastic and rubber and\nproducts thereof (US$342.9 million).\n\nIn March 2023 the Turkmenistan parliament passed a law adopting the Harmonized\nSystem of tariff nomenclature."

Because the state dominates the\neconomy, an estimated 90 percent of workers are in reality effectively state\nemployees. It is believed that downsizing the government workforce, which\nbegan in 2003, increased unemployment in subsequent years. Unemployment in\n2014 was estimated at 11%. In recent years, due to the economic downturn\nlinked to falling hydrocarbon prices, unemployment is estimated to be as high\nas 60 percent, despite official figures of less than four percent."

However, a chart shown on\ntelevision indicated debt in 2021 of US$1.3524 billion. Opposition media\nseized on this figure to estimate GDP of US$12.3 billion based on a statement\nby Central Bank Chairman Rahimberdi Jepbarov that external debt equals 11% of\nGDP.\n\nIn June 2021, official state media reported that debts to China for\nconstruction of natural gas pipelines had been paid in full."
