Uganda is endowed with significant natural resources,\nincluding ample fertile land, regular rainfall, and mineral deposits.\n\nChronic political instability and erratic economic management since the\nimplementation of self-rule has produced a record of persistent economic\ndecline that has left Uganda among of the world's poorest and least-developed\ncountries. The informal economy, which is predominantly female, is broadly\ndefined as a group of vulnerable individuals without protections in regards to\ntheir work. Women face a plethora of barriers specific to gender when\nattempting to access the formal economy of Uganda, and research revealed\nprejudice against lending to women in the informal sector. The national energy\nneeds have historically exceeded the domestic energy generation, though large\npetroleum reserves have been found in the country's west.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the Amin period, the country began a program of economic\nrecovery in 1981 that received considerable foreign assistance. From mid-1984\nonward, overly expansionist fiscal and monetary policies and the renewed\noutbreak of civil strife led to a setback in economic performance.\n\nThe economy has grown since the 1990s; real gross domestic product (GDP) grew\nat an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990–2015, whereas real GDP\nper capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period. During this period,\nthe Ugandan economy experienced economic transformation: the share of\nagriculture value added in GDP declined from 56% in 1990 to 24% in 2015; the\nshare of industry grew from 11% to 20% (with manufacturing increasing at a\nslower pace, from 6% to 9% of GDP); and the share of services went from 32% to\n55%.",

In the\nformal, non-agricultural economy, men constitute 61% of the workforce, whereas\nwomen predominate the informal economy, and this can be attributed to the lack\nof equity between men and women in the country. The Uganda Bureau of\nStatistics reported, when looking at the urban workforce in 2015, 88.6% of\nwomen were employed informally, and 84.2% of men were. Women are unable to\nenter into certain sectors, especially in the formal economy, due to the\ninability to provide substantial initial funding, and remain in the trade and\nservice sectors of the economy. Comparatively, men dominate the more\nprofitable sectors, such as manufacturing.
