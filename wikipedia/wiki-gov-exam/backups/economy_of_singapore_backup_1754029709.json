    "text": "Singapore relies on an extended concept of intermediary trade to entrepôt\ntrade, by purchasing raw goods and refining them for re-export in order to\nsustain its high levels of export-oriented industrialization, such as in the\nwafer-fabrication industry and in oil refining. Singapore has a strategic port\nwhich makes it more competitive than many of its neighbours in carrying out\nsuch entrepôt activities. Singapore's trade-to-GDP ratio is among the highest\nin the world, as of 2020 the ratio was 320%. The Port of Singapore is the\nsecond-busiest in the world by cargo tonnage and is the busiest transshipment\nport in the world.\n\nSingapore is also a regional, continental and global hub for the management\nand operations of various MNCs, because of its strategic location in close\nproximity with other Asia-Pacific markets, along with its advanced\nconnectivity and infrastructure (airline hub and maritime port with a diverse\narray of destinations, Gigabit fiber-optic communications, efficient road\ntransport and public transport) and its immigration policies in welcoming\nglobal talent. In addition, Singapore is a popular international tourist\ndestination for various types of tourism (Business tourism, MICE (Meetings,\nIncentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism, Medical tourism, Urban\ntourism).\n\nSingapore's economy is often referred to as a \"miracle\" due to its rapid\ntransformation from a developing country to a developed, high-income economy\nin a relatively short period of time. This transformation took place in the\nsecond half of the 20th century under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee\nKuan Yew and his government. One of the key factors contributing to\nSingapore's economic miracle was its strategic location, which made it an\nideal hub for international trade and commerce.\n\nThe country's main exports include electronics, chemicals and services.\nSingapore is the regional hub for wealth management. Water is scarce in\nSingapore and a sizeable percentage of water is imported from Malaysia,\ntherefore it is defined as a precious resource.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Singapore's\neconomic landscape. In 2022 SMEs contributed 48% (S$284 bil) of Singapore's\ntotal enterprise nominal value-added and employed 71% of Singapore's total\nworkforce of 3.63 million.\n\nSingapore has limited arable land, meaning that Singapore is heavily reliant\non agrotechnology parks (particularly vertical hydroponic farms) for\nagricultural production. As a result, Singapore imports 90% of its food supply\nand has a wide variety of supplier countries in order to achieve its food\nsecurity; Singapore is ranked as among the most food secure in the world.\n\nApart from its strategic location at the cross-roads of trade between the East\nand the West, Singapore has little to no natural resources, hence human\nresources is a pivotal issue for the health of the Singaporean economy; the\nservices and manufacturing sectors of the economy are heavily reliant on a\nhighly-educated and highly-skilled 'Professional, Managerial, Executive and\nTechnical' (PMET) workforce composed of residents and expatriates. The economy\nof Singapore ranked 2nd overall in the Scientific American Biotechnology\nranking in 2014, with the featuring of Biopolis.\n\nTo preserve its international standing and to further its economic prosperity\nin the 21st century, Singapore has taken measures to promote innovation, to\nencourage entrepreneurship and to retrain its workforce. The Ministry of\nManpower (MoM) has the prime responsibility for setting, adjusting, and\nenforcing immigration rules for foreign workers, in order to achieve the dual\nmandate of maximum employment of the local resident population and maximum\neconomic growth for the nation. Approximately 29% of the total population\nwithin Singapore are non-resident foreigners, including 255,800 foreign\ndomestic workers (FDWs) who operate in Singapore.",

    "text": "In 1819, Stamford Raffles, at the time Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen,\nestablished a trading post in Singapore. Raffles had been searching for a new\nsettlement that could be used as an outpost of the British Empire. He left\nCalcutta and set out to explore much of South-East Asia. At the time, the\nDutch Empire and British Empire were close economic rivals. Colonization\nenabled these empires to gain control of the vast resources of militarily\nweaker and economically less prosperous nations. Raffles was looking for a new\nsettlement that could replace Malacca as a key economic advantage over the\nDutch Empire. The former had been handed over to the Dutch under the Treaty of\nVienna of 1815. Raffles found Singapore to be a perfect location, sitting just\nof the edge of the Straits of Malacca, nowadays one of the most important\nshipping lanes in the world. As well, the territory had key economic resources\nwhich would benefit the British. There was abundant timber and fresh water,\nand a natural deep water harbor which would be beneficial for the British\nfleet. He arrived on an island at the mouth of the Singapore River, where\nthere was a small Malay settlement. At the time accompanied by William\nFarquhar, Raffles met with Temenggong (essentially, Chief of Security, for the\nsettlement) Abdul Rahman to negotiate the right to establish a trading post on\nthe island, under the British Empire. The island was ruled nominally from\nJohar on the peninsula by Tengku (essentially, Prince) Rahman, Sultan of\nJohor, who was heavily influenced by the Dutch and the Bugis. However, the\nSultanate was weakened by factional division so that Temenggong Abdul Rahman\nand his officials were more loyal to Rahman's elder brother Tengku Hussein (or\nTengku Long) who was living in exile in “Riau” (likely the Riau Archipelago).\nWith the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein back to\nSingapore. He offered to recognize Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor and\nprovide him with a yearly stipend; in return, Hussein would grant the British\nthe right to establish a trading post on Singapore.[_citation needed_] On 6\nFebruary 1819 Raffles succeeded in having the territory formally incorporated\ninto the British Empire as the aforementioned trading post.[_citation needed_]\nMuch of the settlement’s rapid economic growth thereafter can be credited to\nits natural suitability as a seaport hub."

    "text": "As a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33\ntimes by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.\nLiving standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income\nstatus to middle-income security with increased household incomes.\n\nIn 1987, Lee claimed that (based on the government's home ownership criterion)\n80% of Singaporeans could now be considered to be members of the middle-class.\nUnder Lee, Singapore had both low inflation and unemployment. However, much\nunlike the economic policies of Greece and the rest of Europe, Singapore\nfollowed a policy of individualising the social safety net. This led to a\nhigher than average savings rate and a very sustainable economy in the long\nrun. Without a burdensome welfare state or its likeliness, Singapore has\ndeveloped a very self-reliant and skilled workforce well versed for a global\neconomy.\n\nThe 1990s posed a great question for Singapore, as to how they would reinvent\ntheir economy. The 1990s emergence of efficient manufacturing firms in\nsoutheast Asia challenged the nation with such a small labor force and land\nrestrictions. Friedrich noted how \" it would be \"unlikely to expand beyond the\ncurrent 25% share of the economy,\" when regarding manufacturing firms. Despite\nstruggling in the manufacturing sector Singapore thrived in global finance,\ntrading, and was an industrial hub for international trade.\n\nSingapore's economic strategy produced real growth averaging 8.0% from 1960 to\n1999. Since the nation's independence in 1965, Singapore's GDP has amassed an\naverage of a 9.5% increase. The economy picked up in 1999 under Goh Chok Tong,\nthe Prime Minister of Singapore, after the regional financial crisis, with a\ngrowth rate of 5.4%, followed by 9.9% for 2000. However, the economic slowdown\nin the United States, Japan and the European Union, as well as the worldwide\nelectronics slump, had reduced the estimated economic growth in 2001 to a\nnegative 2.0%.\n\nThe economy expanded by 2.2% the following year, and by 1.1% in 2003 when\nSingapore was affected by the SARS outbreak. Subsequently, a major turnaround\noccurred in 2004 allowed it to make a significant recovery of 8.3% growth in\nSingapore, although the actual growth fell short of the target growth for the\nyear more than half with only 2.5%. In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in\n2006, 7.9%.\n\nIt was apparent that Singapore would also struggle due to the 2008 financial\ncrisis given its status as a financial services hub. Some market commentators\ndoubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis. In the\nend the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2%\ngrowth rate.\n\nAs of 8 June 2013, Singapore's unemployment rate is around 1.9% and the\ncountry's economy has a lowered growth rate, with a rate of 1.8% on a quarter-\nby-quarter basis—compared to 14.8% in 2010.\n\n2015 and 2016 saw a downturn for the nation as GDP growth shrunk to just 2\npercent. Despite growth diminishing, the nation has yet to post negative\ngrowth rates which are a positive sign. During the same period of diminishing\neconomic growth. Unemployment and inflation have also decreased.\n\nAs of 2017 Singapore's GDP reached $323.907 billion.\n\nSingapore is expected to experience an economic slowdown in 2019, with GDP\ngrowth slowing to 1.9% from 3.1% in 2018, due to tariff hikes from the United\nStates and China.\n\nDuring the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 26 March 2020,\nSingapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said it believed that the economy\nwould contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank\n2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May,\nMTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy\nin 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists had to downgrade their numbers from\npreviously, and some suggested that the economic recovery could take some\ntime. In response to the economic pressure, Moody's temporarily downgraded the\nSingapore banking sector that year from \"stable\" outlook to a \"negative\"\noutlook.\n\nIt was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the Singapore circuit breaker\nmeasures in response to the pandemic, beginning on 7 April could impact the\neconomy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on construction\nworkers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction\nprojects of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry\nChee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020,\nonly slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in\nthe past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming\nmonths. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the\nnumber of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average\nApril since 2015."

Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( July 2013)_\n---|---\nSingaporean exports in 2006\n\nSingapore's total trade in 2022 amounted to $1,365.4 billion SGD. In 2022,\nSingapore's imports were $655.4 billion SGD and exports were $710.0 billion\nSGD. China was Singapore's main import partner, as well as its largest export\nmarket in 2021. Singapore's major trading partners include Malaysia, the\nUnited States and the European Union.\n\nChina is Singapore's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling\nroughly 175 billion Singapore dollars in 2022. Since 2009, the value of\nexports exceeds imports for Singapore's trade with China. In comparison, the\nvalue of imports exceeds exports for Singapore's trade with the US since 2006.\n\nRe-exports accounted for 43% of Singapore's total sales to other countries in\n2000. Singapore's principal exports are electronic components, refined\npetroleum, gold, computers, and packaged medications. Singapore's main imports\nare electronic components, refined petroleum, crude petroleum, gold, and\ncomputers.\n\nTrade in Singapore has benefited from the extensive network of trade\nagreements Singapore has implementing. According to Healy Consultants,\nSingapore has free trade access to the entirety of the ASEAN network, with\nimport duty reduced when dealing with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,\nThailand, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.\n\nThe Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) continues to attract investment\nfunds on a large-scale for the country despite the city's relatively high-cost\noperating environment. The US leads in foreign investment, accounting for 40%\nof new commitments to the manufacturing sector in 2000. As of 1999, cumulative\ninvestment for manufacturing and services by American companies in Singapore\nreached approximately $20 billion (total assets). The bulk of US investment is\nin electronics manufacturing, oil refining and storage, and the chemical\nindustry. More than 1,500 US firms operate in Singapore.\n\nSingapore's largely corruption-free government, skilled workforce, and\nadvanced and efficient infrastructure have attracted investments from more\nthan 3,000 multinational corporations (MNCs) from the United States, Japan,\nand Europe. Foreign firms are found in almost all sectors of the economy. MNCs\naccount for more than two-thirds of manufacturing output and direct export\nsales, although certain services sectors remain dominated by government-linked\ncorporations.\n\nThe government also has encouraged firms to invest outside Singapore, with the\ncountry's total direct investments abroad reaching $39 billion by the end of\n1998. The People's Republic of China was the top destination, accounting for\n14% of total overseas investments, followed by Malaysia (10%), Hong Kong (9%),\nIndonesia (8%) and US (4%). The rapidly growing economy of India, especially\nthe high technology sector, is becoming an expanding source of foreign\ninvestment for Singapore.\n\nThe United States strives to improve bilateral trade with Singapore and has\nsigned the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement in 2003. Singapore corporate tax\nis 17 per cent.\n\nSingapore is the European Union's 14th largest trading partner. Singapore-EU\ntrade is worth more than €50 billion euros a year. Singapore is also the EU's\n5th largest trade in services partner and the EU's 6th destination for foreign\ndirect investment. Over 10,000 EU companies have set up their hubs or offices\nin Singapore.\n\nIn 2018, the EU and Singapore signed the EUSFTA, a free trade agreement which\naims to boost and promote trade between Singapore and the EU. The agreement\nincludes provisions on:\n\n* Eliminating tariffs on goods\n* Harmonizing safety, testing and labeling standards (for cars and vehicle parts, electronics and textiles)\n* Preferential market access and equal treatment for services (for telecommunications, financial services, transport, etc.)\n* Simplifying customs procedures and improving trade facilitation\n* Improved protection of intellectual property\n* Guaranteed access to government procurement contracts\n* Legally-binding commitments on environmental protection and workers' rights\n\nIn addition to the free trade agreement, the EU and Singapore signed an\ninvestment protection agreement which aims to encourage investment between\nSingapore and the EU. It ensures that governments in the EU and Singapore\ntreat each other's investors equally, and replaces old-style bilateral\ninvestment treaties between Singapore and individual EU countries."

With limited access\nto natural resources, Singapore had been forced to invest in its\npeople.[_citation needed_] The country has the largest proficiency of English\nlanguage speakers in Asia, making it an attractive place for multinational\ncorporations. Singapore has come a long way from where it once stood. In the\n1970s according to Tilak Abeysinghe \"2.4 percent of the labor force were\ndegree holders\". By 1990 the number rose to just 6.3%. In 2013 the percentage\nof the labor force who held degrees reached 31%. The nation's directive toward\nhigh skilled labor jobs, has promoted both growth and education to the region.\nThe National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the sole trade union federation,\nwhich has a symbiotic relationship with the ruling party, accounts for almost\n99% of total organised labour. Government policy and pro-activity rather than\nlabour legislation controls general labour and trade union matters.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nThe Employment Act offers little protection to white-collar workers due to an\nincome threshold. The Industrial Arbitration Court handles labour-management\ndisputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower.\nThe Singapore Government has stressed the importance of co-operation between\nunions, management and government (tripartism), as well as the early\nresolution of disputes. There has been only one strike in the past 15 years.\n\nSingapore has enjoyed virtually full employment for long periods of time. Amid\nan economic slump, the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% by the end of 2001, from\n2.4% early in the year. Unemployment has since declined and as of 2012 the\nunemployment rate stands at 1.9%.\n\nWhile the Singapore government has taken a stance against minimum wage and\nunemployment benefit schemes, in 2007 the government introduced a Workfare\nIncome Supplement (WIS) scheme to supplement wages of low-skilled workers. To\nsupport employers in hiring older Singaporean workers, Special Employment\nCredit (SEC) was introduced in 2011. It was first enhanced in 2012 to provide\nemployers with support in hiring older Singaporean workers and Persons with\nDisabilities (PWDs). It helped the employers to cope with costs associated\nwith the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older\nworkers. The 5-year SEC scheme was further extended an additional 3 years, up\nto 2019 to encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ older workers aged 65\nand above. The Singapore Government and the NTUC have tried a range of\nprograms to increase lagging productivity and boost the labour force\nparticipation rates of women and older workers. However, labour shortages\npersist in the service sector and in many low-skilled positions in the\nconstruction and electronics industries. Foreign workers help make up this\nshortfall. In 2000, there were about 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore,\nconstituting 27% of the total work force. As a result, wages are relatively\nsuppressed or do not rise for all workers. To have some controls, the\ngovernment imposes a foreign worker levy payable by employers for low end\nworkers like domestic help and construction workers. In 2012, the Ministry of\nTrade and Industry (MTI) reported that Singapore should continue to fine-tune\nthe calibration of its inflow of foreigners as the country continues to face\nan ageing population and a shrinking workforce. Singapore Parliament accepted\nthe recommendations by its Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) for the optimal\nratio of the level of immigration and foreign manpower for both high and low\nskilled workers. The Government recognises that the current overall foreign\nworkforce should complement the local resident workforce and not replace the\nSingaporean Core concept, and helps companies greatly as they raise\nproductivity through business restructuring and workforce retraining; raise\nresident labour force participation rate."

    "text": "Singapore is one of the world's wealthiest countries _per capita_ , but its\nGini coefficient is high in comparison to developed countries. Statistics on\nincome inequality are published by the Singapore Department of Statistics.\nWithout taking taxes and social transfers into account, Singapore's gini\ncoefficient puts the country in the medium range. Nevertheless, the country\nremains on the \"very high\" category on the inequality-adjusted human\ndevelopment index (IHDI), a ranking similar to the Human Development Index\n(HDI), but with inequality also accounted for.\n\nIn October 2018, Oxfam ranked Singapore 149 out of 157 in its Commitment to\nReducing Inequality Index 2018, placing it among the bottom ten of the\ncountries in the index, which ranks countries based on efforts to reduce\neconomic inequality. In its report, Oxfam accused Singapore of practices which\nencouraged \"harmful tax practices\", not having a universal minimum wage (apart\nfrom janitors and security guards), and poor performance on labour rights. The\ngovernment responded to the report by claiming that it was more important to\nlook at \"real outcomes\" such as Singapore's high home ownership, health,\neducation, and employment, rather than public spending or tax rates, also\nsaying that the report \"assumes that high taxation and high public expenditure\nreflects commitment to combating inequality\".\n\nThe government provides social support through a variety of social assistance\nschemes. The Ministry of Social and Family Development runs ComCare, a program\nwhich provides income support for low-income citizen households through\nvarious schemes for short-to-medium term assistance, long-term assistance,\nchild support, and urgent financial needs. The Community Development Councils\nalso run various local assistance schemes within their districts. The Ministry\nof Manpower runs a Silver Support Scheme which provides additional financial\nsupport for low-income elderly with no family support. Meanwhile, the Ministry\nof Health also runs MediFund to assist families that have difficulty paying\nfor medical bills despite government subsidies and other health financing\nschemes. In addition, the National Council of Social Service coordinates a\nrange of 450 non-government voluntary welfare organisations to provide social\nservices, while raising funds through The Community Chest of Singapore.\n\nToday, low and middle-income groups now receive 2.5 times the public subsidies\nthey did ten years ago."

    "text": "Government spending in Singapore has risen since the start of the 2008\nfinancial crisis, from around 15% of GDP in 2008 to 17% in 2012. The\ngovernment's total expenditure as a percentage of GDP ranks among the lowest\ninternationally and allows for a competitive tax regime. Singapore is required\nunder its constitution to keep a balanced budget over each term of government.\nSingapore government debt is issued for investment purposes, not to fund\nexpenditure.\n\nPersonal income taxes in Singapore range from 0% to 22% for incomes above\nS$320,000. There are no capital gains or inheritance taxes in Singapore.\nSingapore's corporate tax rate is 17% with exemptions and incentives for\nsmaller businesses. Singapore has a single-tier corporate income tax system,\nwhich means there is no double-taxation for shareholders.\n\nSingapore introduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) with an initial rate of 3%\non 1 April 1994, increasing government's revenue by S$1.6 billion (US$1b,\n€800m) and establishing government finances. The GST rate increased to 4% in\n2003, 5% in 2004, 7% in 2007, 8% in 2023, and 9% in 2024.\n\nThe Singapore government owns two investment companies, GIC Private Limited\nand Temasek Holdings, which manage Singapore's reserves. Both operate as\ncommercial investment holding companies independently of the Singapore\ngovernment, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his wife Ho Ching serve as\nchairman and CEO of these corporations respectively. While GIC invests abroad,\nTemasek holds 31% of its portfolio in Singapore, holding majority stakes in\nseveral of the nation's largest companies, such as Singapore Airlines,\nSingtel, ST Engineering and Mediacorp. As of 2014, Temasek holds S$69 billion\nof assets in Singapore, accounting for 7% of the total capitalisation of\nSingapore-listed companies.\n\nIn April 2013, the country was recognised as an increasingly popular tax haven\nfor the wealthy due to the low tax rate on personal income, a full tax\nexemption on income that is generated outside of Singapore and 69 double\ntaxation treaties that can minimise both withholding tax and capital gains\ntax. Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy, with an estimated personal\nwealth worth AU$835 million, and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo\nSaverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore\n(Blundy in 2013 and Saverin in 2012). Additionally, Australian mining magnate\nGina Rinehart owns property in Singapore and American investor Jim Rogers\nmoved to Singapore in 2007—Rogers has identified the 21st century as an era in\nwhich Asia will dominate and wishes for his two daughters to learn Mandarin as\na key outcome of the relocation. Chinese Media TV celebrities Jet Li and Gong\nLi have also taken up naturalised Singapore citizenship."

    "text": "The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and\nfinancial regulatory authority. Its current chairman is Lawrence Wong (July\n2023–present). It administers the various statutes pertaining to money,\nbanking, insurance, securities and the financial sector in general, as well as\ncurrency issuance. The MAS has been given powers to act as a banker to and\nfinancial agent of the Government. It has also been entrusted to promote\nmonetary stability, and credit and exchange policies conducive to the growth\nof the economy.\n\nUnlike many other central banks such as Federal Reserve System, European\nCentral Bank or Bank of England, MAS does not regulate the monetary system via\ninterest rates to influence the liquidity in the system. Instead, it chooses\nto do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since\n1981. In doing so it manages the Singapore dollar versus a number of\ncurrencies that they do not reveal publicly – a Singapore dollar nominal\neffective exchange rate (S$ NEER). It carries this out by intervening in the\nSGD market as well as other operations in the money market. The MAS reviews\nits policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is\naround every 6 months. In some circumstances, such as during the COVID-19\npandemic MAS can change the date of its twice yearly meeting.\n\nIn May 2022, six major banks agreed to pay $64.5 million to resolve antitrust\nallegations that they worked together to rig benchmark Singapore interest\nrates. The banks involved included Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG, The\nHongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, ING Bank N.V., Citibank\nN.A. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nPolicy decisions  Date  | Changes\n---|---\n22 February 2001  | gradual modest appreciation rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band.\n10 April 2001  | gradual modest appreciation rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band.\n12 July 2001  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band.\n10 October 2001  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; width widened.\n2 January 2002  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; width narrowed.\n14 October 2016  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n13 April 2017  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n13 October 2017  | zero percent rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n13 April 2018  | slightly increase rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n12 October 2018  | slightly increase rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n12 April 2019  | unchanged rate of appreciation of SGD NEER band; no change to width and the level at which it is centred.\n14 October 2019  | slightly reduce rate of appreciation, with no change in width.\n30 March 2020  | zero percent per annum rate of appreciation, starting at the prevailing level with no change in width.\n14 October 2020  | There was no change in foreign exchange policy from the March decision.
