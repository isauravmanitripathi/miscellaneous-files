Record high Gold price 2023 earned Ghana 15.6 billion $\nof exports.\n\nThe Ghanaian domestic economy in 2012 revolved around services, which\naccounted for 50% of GDP and employed 28% of the work force. Besides the\nindustrialization associated with minerals and oil, industrial development in\nGhana remains basic, often associated with plastics (such as chairs, plastic\nbags, razors, and pens). 53.6% of Ghana's workforce were employed in\nagriculture in 2013.[_outdated statistic_]\n\nGhana embarked on a currency re-denomination exercise from the Cedi (₵) to the\nnew currency, Ghana Cedi (GH₵) in July 2007. The transfer rate is 1 Ghana Cedi\nfor every 10,000 Cedis.\n\nGhana became the largest gold-producing country in Africa after overtaking\nSouth Africa in 2019. The country is also the second-largest cocoa producer\n(after Ivory Coast). Ghana is rich in diamonds,  manganese or manganese ore,\nbauxite, and oil. Most of its debt was cancelled in 2005, but government\nspending was later allowed to balloon. Coupled with a plunge in oil prices,\nthis led to an economic crisis that forced the government to negotiate a $920\nmillion extended credit facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in\nApril 2015. Bloomberg rated Ghana currency Cedi as the strongest performing\ncurrency in the World April 2025 against the Dollar reducing its debt burden.",
