    "text": "Egypt’s earliest industrial efforts began under Muhammad Ali (r. 1805–1849),\nwhose state-led program focused on military goods, agricultural processing,\nand textiles. By the 1830s, 30 cotton mills employed around 30,000 workers,\nbut the experiment collapsed due to poor management, fuel shortages, and\nreliance on forced corvée labor. Though short-lived, this phase weakened\ntraditional artisan guilds and introduced wage labor. A later wave under\nIsma'il Pasha (r. 1863–1879), sparked by the American Civil War cotton boom,\nsaw attempts at diversification with sugar refineries and textile plants.\nThese too struggled against European competition, but they helped expand\nEgypt’s wage labor force and laid foundations for a modern working class.\n\nBetween 1869 and 1876, Ismail launched British-led military campaigns against\nSudanese slave raiders, as part of broader efforts to reassert Egyptian\nauthority in Sudan. The process culminated in the signing of the Anglo-\nEgyptian Slave Trade Convention in 1877, which formally ended the practice of\nslavery and slave trade in Egypt. Ismail’s increasing political subordination\nto Britain, particularly after Egypt's default on its international debt in\n1876, likely facilitated the agreement.\n\nBy the late 19th century, a clearer working class began to emerge. This was\nshaped by Egypt’s integration into the global capitalist economy under foreign\ncontrol, especially following the British occupation in 1882. European\ncapital, attracted to Egypt’s export sector, invested heavily in transport and\nutilities, prompting the development of urban infrastructure but neglecting\nbroader industrialization. Employment in these sectors, especially railways,\nports, and public utilities, formed the nucleus of the new working class.\n\nKing Fuad I with his ministers on a visit to the phosphate mines in the Red\nSea region.\n\nLegal reforms under Muhammad Ali and his successors enabled land\nprivatization, displacing a third of the peasantry by the late 19th century.\nMany had migrated to cities, joining an expanding pool of wage laborers.\nMeanwhile, the rise of foreign capital eroded Egypt’s artisan guilds,\nparticularly after the 1890 Professional Permits Duty. Guilds fractured, with\nguild heads becoming labor contractors and members reduced to common laborers,\nleading to tensions culminating in early labor unrest such as the 1882 Port\nSaid coal loaders' strike.\n\nBy the early 20th century, guild-based trades had collapsed, leading to a\nnotable increase in wage labor. Foreign skilled workers, mainly Greeks,\nArmenians, and Italians, introduced European labor ideologies and led early\nstrikes in sectors like cigarettes, tailoring, and printing. However, wage\ndisparities and employer manipulation often hindered unity with Egyptian\nworkers. Strikes in the tram and railway sectors fostered unionization and\ngreater class awareness, especially during the 1908 and 1911 Cairo tram\nstrikes, which drew harsh repression and led to martial law in 1914.\n\nDespite several waves of industrial experimentation, early attempts at\nindustrialization struggled due to factors like tariff restrictions imposed by\nBritain through the 1838 commercial treaty. In the beginning of the 20th\ncentury, little industrial development occurred, and Egypt's land-owning elite\ninvested mainly in land rather than industry. Foreign competition stunted\ndomestic ventures, with only a few enterprises, such as sugar and cotton\nprocessing, surviving under foreign ownership. In the following years, over\none million Egyptians would be conscripted to the Egyptian Labour Corps and\nEgyptian Camel Transport Corps to support British efforts in World War I,\noften through coercion. Simultaneously, wartime shortages fostered growth in\ndomestic industries such as textiles and food processing, prompting the\nestablishment of the Commission of Commerce and Industry in 1916.\n\nTalaat Harb, widely regarded as the father of the modern Egyptian economy\n\nBy the 1920s, Egypt’s urban labor force had grown significantly, supported by\na limited but increasing domestic industrialization under a wave of economic\nnationalism pioneered in large part by Talaat Harb, an Egyptian financier. In\n1920, Harb founded Banque Misr, the country’s first national bank funded\nentirely with Egyptian capital, with an initial start-up capital of EGP 80,000\n(approximately USD 5,000). Harb envisioned a financial institution that would\nchannel national savings into industrial and economic development. His efforts\nmarked a turning point in Egypt’s economic history, enabling Egyptians to\nexert greater control over their country’s financial resources and laying the\nfoundation for national industrialization.\n\nBeyond banking, Harb spearheaded the establishment of multiple industrial and\nservice ventures across textiles, insurance, shipping, real estate, and media.\nHe founded Studio Misr in 1935, which became Egypt’s leading film production\nhub for over three decades, as well as EgyptAir in 1932, the first airline in\nthe Middle East and the seventh in the world. Through Banque Misr, he also\nlaunched companies in cotton ginning, paper manufacturing, and printing,\nhelping to create a vertically integrated national economy. These initiatives\nwere critical in asserting Egypt’s economic independence and identity during\nand after the colonial period.\n\nThe Great Depression helped catalyze industrialization, shifting Egypt toward\nimport-substitution industries. In 1930, the expiration of commercial treaties\nallowed Egypt to control its tariff policies, fostering local industry. On\nFebruary 16, 1930, Egypt enacted tariff reforms aimed at protecting local\nindustries. The government imposed high duties on imports and reduced taxes on\nraw materials, encouraging local manufacturing. The changes led to a decline\nin imports of finished goods and an increase in raw materials and machinery by\n1938.\n\nWorld War II provided a boost to industrialization, with increased demand from\nAllied forces and local consumers. Many industries diversified, while new\nenterprises emerged. The war also trained workers, helping to establish a\nfoundation for local industries that expanded in the post-war period. By 1947,\nthe government enacted laws and established an industrial bank to support\nindustrial growth.",

The officers held King Farouk\nresponsible for Egypt’s military defeat in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the\ncountry's persistent socioeconomic problems, including widespread poverty,\nilliteracy, and underdevelopment. These conditions were underscored by the\nstagnation of per capita gross national product (GNP), which averaged E£43 in\n1954 prices between the end of World War I and the 1952 Revolution.\n\nUnder Gamal Abdel Nasser, Egypt's economy saw substantial growth driven by\nagrarian reforms, import substitution, key nationalisation efforts like the\nSuez Canal Company, and major infrastructure projects, including the Helwan\nsteel works and the Aswan High Dam. This period marked an unprecedented rise\nin living standards, offering Egyptians access to housing, education,\nhealthcare, and employment.\n\nPresident Nasser at the inauguration of the Nasr Automotive factory in Helwan\n\nThe land reforms of 1952 aimed to weaken the old landowning class and promote\nindustrialization, with Nasser’s government supporting urban workers through\nlabor reforms. The nationalization of key industries occurred between 1957 and\n1961, alongside increased public sector control. While the initial economic\nresults were positive, a crisis emerged by the mid-1960s due to the\nunsustainable combination of rising consumption and investment.\n\nBy necessity if not by design, the revolutionary regime gave considerably\ngreater priority to economic development than did the monarchy, and the\neconomy has been a central government concern since then. While the economy\ngrew steadily, it sometimes exhibited sharp fluctuations. Analysis of economic\ngrowth is further complicated by the difficulty in obtaining reliable\nstatistics. Growth figures are often disputed, and economists contend that\ngrowth estimates may be grossly inaccurate because of the informal economy and\nworkers' remittances, which may contribute as much as one-fourth of GNP.\nAccording to one estimate, the gross domestic product (GDP), at 1965 constant\nprices, grew at an annual compound rate of about 4.2 percent between 1955 and\n1975. This was about 1.7 times larger than the annual population growth rate\nof 2.5 percent in the same period. The period between 1967 and 1974, the final\nyears of Gamal Abdul Nasser's presidency and the early part of Anwar Sadat's,\nhowever, were lean years, with growth rates of only about 3.3 percent. The\nslowdown was caused by many factors, including agricultural and industrial\nstagnation and the costs of the 1967 war. Investments, which were a crucial\nfactor for the preceding growth, also nose-dived and recovered only in 1975\nafter the dramatic 1973 increase in oil prices.\n\nAnwar Sadat’s Infitah, or \"Open Door Policy\", introduced in 1974, marked a\nstark departure from Nasser's approach, shifting Egypt toward closer ties with\nthe Western capitalist market. This policy led to the emergence of a new\nruling coalition, consisting of technocrats, former landowners, and private-\nsector entrepreneurs, further solidifying the role of market forces in Egypt's\neconomy. The changes introduced under Sadat's era effectively marked a shift\ntowards capitalist development, contrary to the socialist trajectory some had\nhoped for following Nasser’s reforms.\n\nLike most countries in the Middle East, Egypt partook of the oil boom and\nsuffered the subsequent slump. Available figures suggest that between 1975 and\n1980 the GDP (at 1980 prices) grew at an annual rate of more than 11 percent.\nThis impressive achievement resulted, not from the contribution of\nmanufacturing or agriculture, but from oil exports, remittances, foreign aid,\nand grants. From the mid-1980s, GDP growth slowed as a result of the 1985-86\ncrash in oil prices. In the two succeeding years, the GDP grew at no more than\nan annual rate of 2.9 percent. Of concern for the future was the decline of\nthe fixed investment ratio from around 30 percent during most of the 1975-85\ndecade to 22 percent in 1987.",

    "text": "Smart Village, a business district in 6th of October established in 2001 to\nfacilitate the growth of high-tech businesses.\n\nEgypt began implementing structural adjustment reforms in the early 1990s to\naddress a worsening macroeconomic situation marked by low growth, double-digit\ninflation, unsustainable fiscal and current account deficits, and heavy\nreliance on import restrictions to protect inefficient, state-led industries.\nThese reforms aimed to reduce the country’s rentier-state characteristics by\nshifting economic control from the public to the private sector.\n\nA major shift occurred in 2004 with the appointment of Ahmed Nazif as prime\nminister. His cabinet introduced a new round of reforms, including the\nrestructuring of the banking sector, increasing the private sector share, and\nwidespread privatization of state-owned enterprises. Efforts to reduce the\npublic debt included cutting subsidies and shrinking the government workforce.\n\nIn this period Egypt experienced fluctuating economic growth accompanied by\nshifting patterns of poverty, inequality, and middle-class formation. The\ngovernment undertook major policy reforms, with significant changes in income\ndistribution, and debates over whether economic growth was inclusive or \"pro-\npoor\".\n\nDespite economic growth, poverty persisted. The proportion of Egyptians living\nunder the national poverty line declined from 24.2% in 1991 to a low of 16.7%\nin 2000, before rising again to 22% in 2008. Similarly, the share of the\npopulation living on less than $2 per day (PPP) fell from 28% in 1990 to 15%\nby 2008. Absolute extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.25 per\nday, remained relatively low at around 2% from 2000 onward.\n\n**Indicator** | **1980** | **1990** | **2000** | **2005** | **2010**\n---|---|---|---|---|---\nGDP per capita at constant prices, (E£) | 9,548.57 | 12,507.81 | 15,437.06 | 16,680.25 | 20,226.91\nGDP per capita at current prices, (E£) | 406.03 | 1,967.41 | 5,607.67 | 8,003.33 | 16,115.11\nGDP per capita at current prices, (US$) | 580.04 | 1,870.85 | 1,642.63 | 1,330.46 | 2,921.76\nGDP (PPP) per capita, (Int$) | 2,252.47 | 4,444.05 | 6,725.83 | 8,137.14 | 10,848.16\n\nThe Gini index, a measure of income inequality, remained moderate, fluctuating\nbetween 30 and 33.8 over the period. The Palma ratio, which captures the\nincome share of the richest 10% compared to the poorest 40%, declined\nslightly, indicating marginal improvement in distribution.\n\nThe middle class, however, exhibited a more complex trajectory. Using absolute\nincome thresholds, the middle class appeared to constitute over 80% of the\npopulation by 2008. Yet, when defined using relative or median-based\nthresholds, its size appeared far smaller, approximately 40% by some\nestimates, and even declined during periods of high economic growth. This\nparadox reflected the vulnerability of those just above the poverty line,\noften labeled as “new strugglers”, who were susceptible to falling back into\npoverty.\n\nTo stimulate investment and trade, the corporate tax rate was lowered from 40\nto 20 percent, and tax collection mechanisms were strengthened. Tariff\nbarriers were drastically reduced, and Egypt entered into preferential trade\nagreements with the United States, the European Union, several Arab and\nAfrican neighbors, as well as neighboring states. These changes contributed to\nan improved business climate and growing investor confidence. Between 2003 and\n2008, exports of goods and services tripled, tourism surged by over 60\npercent, and foreign direct investment rose by 50 percent in 2007 alone. As a\nresult, Egypt’s external debt declined to less than 20 percent of GDP by 2009.\n\nAlthough the 2000s were marked by robust macroeconomic growth, the benefits\nwere not evenly distributed. Consumption gains were concentrated among the top\ndecile, while lower quintiles saw marginal improvements. Consequently, while\npoverty indicators improved, public dissatisfaction remained widespread, as\nlarge segments of the population perceived limited social mobility or\nsecurity. The disconnect between growth and equitable distribution contributed\nto mounting discontent in the years leading to the 2011 revolution.",

Concerns over social unrest and financial\ninstability led to repeated downgrades by credit rating agencies.

The sharp devaluation that\nfollowed improved Egypt's external balance but also led to inflationary\npressures.\n\nDespite claims by the Central Bank of Egypt that the currency remained free-\nfloating, reports indicated that by 2018 the central bank was actively using\nstate-owned banks to manage the pound’s value, effectively returning to a\ncontrolled exchange rate.

    "text": "Egypt’s international trade has long been a central pillar of its economy,\nconstituting 40% of its GDP according to the World Bank. Over the years, the\ncountry has pursued greater economic integration through a series of free\ntrade agreements, including those with the EU-Egypt Association Agreement and\nthe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The association agreement\nwith the EU, in force since 2004, established a free-trade area by eliminating\ntariffs on industrial goods and facilitating agricultural trade. A subsequent\nagreement in 2010 expanded this arrangement to processed agricultural and\nfisheries products. The gradual reduction of customs duties has significantly\nstrengthened economic ties, with bilateral trade between the EU and Egypt more\nthan doubling from €11.8 billion in 2004 to €27.9 billion in 2017.\n\nThe Pan-Arab Free Trade Area (PAFTA), signed by 17 Arab League members in 1981\nand implemented in 1997, aims to enhance trade among Arab states by\neliminating non-tariff barriers and gradually reducing tariffs. Originally\nplanned to achieve full tariff removal by 2007, an Arab League summit in 2002\naccelerated this timeline, establishing a zero-tariff trade zone by 2005 while\ngranting preferential treatment to the least developed member states.\n\nEgypt's participation in the AfCFTA is expected to enhance its trade with\nAfrican markets, expanding beyond its traditional partners in Europe and the\nMiddle East. As part of the Guided Trade Initiative (GTI), Egypt is working to\naccelerate integration, with sectors such as renewable energy,\npharmaceuticals, and textiles identified as potential areas of growth. While\nlogistical challenges exist, Egypt’s established industrial base and supply\nchain networks may support greater regional trade and economic cooperation.\n\nEgypt also benefits from Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZs), which grant\ntariff-free access to U.S. markets for exports meeting predefined rules of\norigin. These zones offer cost advantages, exemption from non-tariff barriers,\nand access to Egypt’s large labor pool, attracting both local and foreign\ninvestors. Initially established in Alexandria, the Suez Canal, Greater Cairo,\nand the Central Delta, the program has since expanded to Minya and Beni Suef.\n\nPetroleum and natural gas have historically dominated both exports and\nimports, reflecting the country’s role as a regional energy hub. In addition\nto hydrocarbons, Egypt exports a diverse range of goods, including textiles,\nfertilizers, plastics, and agricultural products.\n\nImports, meanwhile, are characterized by a high demand for intermediate and\ninvestment goods, reflecting the needs of the country’s industrial and\ninfrastructure sectors. Essential commodities such as iron, steel, plastics,\nwheat, and pharmaceuticals also constitute a substantial share of inbound\ntrade.\n\nEgypt's exports have seen significant growth in the past years, reaching $51.1\nbillion in 2023. The Egyptian government has set a target to increase exports\nto $145 billion by 2030. A new export support program, expected to launch in\nearly 2026, will focus on boosting competitiveness by enhancing the value of\nEgyptian products and offering incentives for small companies and start-ups.\nThis system, alongside the settlement of overdue dues, aims to address\nchallenges faced by exporters, ensuring fair support distribution and\nfostering investment",

The Minister of Emigration and Expatriate\nAffairs reported that the number of Egyptians living abroad has increased more\nthan fivefold since 2013, rising from 2.7 million in 2013 to 14 million in\n2023 and according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), remittances reached\n$23.7 billion between January and October 2024, reflecting a 45.3% increase\nfrom $16.3 billion during the same period in 2023.\n\nRemittances recorded a decline during 2022/2023, when inflows dropped to $22.1\nbillion from a peak of $31.9 billion in 2021/2022, figures rebounded in 2024.\nThis was attributed to global disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, exchange\nrate volatility, and geopolitical factors, including the Russian-Ukrainian\nwar. The March 2024 economic measures, particularly the liberalization of\nexchange rates and increased interest rates on Egyptian pound and dollar-\ndenominated savings instruments, played a key role in restoring remittance\ninflows to the formal banking system.\n\nAs a result of this recovery, Egypt has moved from sixth to fifth place\nglobally among the top remittance-receiving countries, ranking behind India,\nMexico, China, and the Philippines. The sustained rise in remittances\nunderscores their continued importance to Egypt’s economy and highlights the\nimpact of recent economic policies on foreign currency inflows.\n\nThe Egyptian government considers remittances from Egyptians abroad vital to\nthe economy and aims to sustain their growth as part of its broader economic\nstrategy. To that end, the government has introduced various measures to\nattract remittances, including offering dollar savings certificates with some\nof the highest interest rates globally, according to the Minister of\nEmigration and Expatriate Affairs. These efforts aim to bolster foreign\ncurrency inflows and integrate remittances into the formal banking system.\n\nAdditional incentives include customs exemptions for cars imported for\npersonal use, requiring a foreign currency deposit refundable in Egyptian\npounds after five years at the prevailing exchange rate. The government has\nalso introduced a final exemption from compulsory conscription for draft\nevaders or male students abroad over the age of 18, available for a fee of\n$5,000 or €5,000. Furthermore, the state has promoted real estate sales in\nforeign currency, offering land and property to Egyptians abroad and foreign\ninvestors.\n\nAccording to a study by the International Organization for Migration, most\nremittance-receiving households use the funds for daily expenses, but 20%\nportion is invested in real estate, small businesses, and other economic\nactivities.",

    "text": "In the 19th century, Egypt's currency system was based on the piastre (qersh),\nsubdivided into 40 para. Although formally equal to its Ottoman counterpart\nafter the 1840 Turkish-Egyptian treaty, the Egyptian piastre was typically\nvalued higher, leading to disparities in exchange, such as 10 Egyptian\npiastres equaling 11 Turkish piastres around the mid-19th century,. Egypt\nadopted a bimetallic standard in 1834, basing its system on the Maria Theresa\nthaler, known as _abu taqa_ in Egypt, which was valued at 20 piastres. The\n1830s saw the introduction of new gold and silver coins, yet foreign coins\nlike the British sovereign continued to circulate at unofficial rates.\n\nThe 1885 currency reform led to the adoption of the gold standard, introducing\nthe Egyptian pound (jeneih) at E£1 = 7.4375 grams of fine gold. Pegged to the\nBritish gold sovereign, it maintained an exchange value of 97.5 piastres per\npound sterling, replacing the Egyptian piastre (qersh) as the primary currency\nunit. This reform standardized foreign exchange rates by law and adjusted the\nMaria Theresa thaler to 21 piastres, while 20 piastres equaled 5 French\nfrancs.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Egypt abandoned the gold standard and pegged\nits currency to the British pound at a fixed rate, which remained until 1962\nwhen it shifted to the U.S. dollar. In 1969, Egypt adopted a multiple exchange\nrate system to address two key challenges. It helped mitigate the negative\neffects of an overvalued currency on external competitiveness while also\nmanaging the country's heavy reliance on workers’ remittances.\n\nBy the 1980s, external shocks, including declining oil prices and rising debt,\nexposed the vulnerabilities of Egypt's economy. The government attempted\nexchange rate liberalization in 1987, reducing multiple exchange rates from\nfive to three, implementing a gradual devaluation, and establishing a free\nexchange market. However, these measures proved insufficient due to Egypt's\ncontinued dependence on external revenues from oil, the Suez Canal, and\nremittances, and by the early 1990s, Egypt faced mounting fiscal deficits,\ninflation, and a balance of payments crisis.\n\nIn response, the Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program was\nlaunched in 1991, backed by the IMF and World Bank. This program sought to\nunify exchange rates, liberalize trade, and reduce state intervention. The\nEgyptian pound was pegged to the U.S. dollar, supported by tight fiscal\npolicies and high-interest rates. While this approach stabilized inflation and\nattracted capital inflows, it led to a gradual overvaluation of the currency,\nreducing competitiveness and straining foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s saw growing pressure on the fixed exchange rate\nsystem due to external shocks, including the 1997 Asian financial crisis and\ndeclining oil prices. By 2003, Egypt adopted a managed float, allowing greater\ncurrency flexibility while still maintaining central bank interventions.\nHowever, persistent trade imbalances and political instability following the\n2011 revolution led to renewed currency pressures. A foreign exchange black\nmarket sprung up, and by 2016, Egypt was forced to implement a full float of\nthe pound under an IMF-backed reform program. The sharp devaluation that\nfollowed improved Egypt's external balance but also led to inflationary\npressures.\n\nBy 2018, despite official claims of a free float, the Central Bank of Egypt\nwas reportedly intervening through state-owned banks to manage the pound’s\nvalue. The COVID-19 pandemic and later the Russia-Ukraine war further weakened\nEgypt’s external position, disrupting tourism, raising commodity prices, and\ntriggering a dollar shortage that revived the black market.\n\nIn 2024, the government floated the pound again, leading to a 40% depreciation\nand a 600-basis-point interest rate hike. This unlocked an $8 billion IMF loan\nwithin a $20 billion international support package and helped stabilize the\ncurrency. Recovery was further supported by a $35 billion investment deal with\nthe UAE to develop Ras El Hekma, the largest foreign investment in Egypt’s\nhistory.",

Due to the country's arid climate and minimal rainfall, the vast\nmajority of Egypt’s population and agricultural activity is concentrated along\nthe Nile Valley and Nile Delta. The Nile Valley in Egypt is a narrow,\nelongated corridor of fertile land that cuts through an otherwise arid and\nhyper-arid landscape. Bordered by vast desert plateaus to the east and west,\nthe valley forms a ribbon of greenery stretching from the Sudanese border in\nthe south to the Nile Delta in the north.\n\nTo manage its limited water resources, Egypt constructed the Aswan High Dam,\ncompleted in 1970, which created Lake Nasser, one of the world’s largest\nartificial reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 130 billion m³. The dam\nplays a critical role in regulating Nile flows, enabling year-round\nirrigation, and mitigating flood and drought cycles. With a fixed annual\nrelease of 55.5 billion m³ (1.96 trillion cu ft), as stipulated by the 1959\nNile Waters Agreement between Egypt and Sudan, it constitutes 97 percent of\nthe country's renewable water resources.\n\nFacing increasing water scarcity and rising demand, Egypt has adopted treated\nwastewater reuse as a strategic component of its national water management\npolicy. The volume of wastewater produced in Egypt is approximately 16.4\nbillion m³ annually, comprising 4.4 billion m³ of municipal sewage and 12\nbillion m³ of agricultural drainage water. As of recent estimates, Egypt\noperates over 400 wastewater treatment plants employing a range of\ntechnologies including activated sludge, oxidation ponds, up-flow anaerobic\nsludge blankets, and membrane bioreactors. Treated wastewater is primarily\nreused for agricultural irrigation.\n\nRainfall in Egypt is minimal, with significant precipitation occurring only\nalong the north coast, where annual averages range between 50 and 250\nmillimetres. Rainfall increases eastward, reaching about 150 mm in Arish and\n250 mm in Rafah. Based on average winter precipitation, the volume of\nrainwater falling over the northern regions of Egypt, which cover an area of\napproximately 200,000 km², is estimated at 5 to 10 billion m³ per year. Of\nthis, about 1.5 billion m³ contributes to surface runoff, while most of the\nremainder evaporates or percolates into the groundwater system. In the Sinai\nPeninsula, surface runoff from rainfall amounts to approximately 131.67\nmillion m³ per year, constituting 5.25% of total rainfall there. Only 200–300\nmillion m³ are effectively harvested in regions such as Sinai, the north\ncoast, and the Red Sea mountains.",

The most significant\namong them is the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, the world's largest known\nfossil water aquifer system. This vast underground reservoir, located beneath\nthe eastern end of the Sahara desert, extends across the political boundaries\nof four northeastern African countries. The system spans approximately 2.2\nmillion km², with about 826,000 km² located in Egypt, nearly 40% of the total\narea and the largest share among the four countries, covering over 80% of the\ncountry's land surface.

The most ambitious of all irrigation\nprojects was the Aswan High Dam, completed in 1971. A report from the National\nCouncil for Production and Economic Affairs in March 1975 reflected the dam's\nsuccess in regulating floodwaters and providing a reliable water supply.\nHowever, it was noted that water consumption had exceeded expectations, and\nmeasures to control this were being considered. Some fertile land was lost due\nto the cessation of the flow of Nile silt, and increasing salinity presented\nchallenges. Additionally, a period of drought in the Ethiopia highlands, the\nsource of the Nile's waters, caused the level of Lake Nasser, the dam's\nreservoir, to reach its lowest point in 1987.\n\nIn the 1970s, despite considerable investments in land reclamation,\nagriculture gradually lost its place as the primary sector of the economy.\nAgricultural exports, which accounted for 87% of Egypt’s merchandise export\nvalue in 1960, had declined to 35% by 1974 and 11% by 2001. As of the 2020s,\nagriculture accounts for approximately 10% of Egypt’s GDP and provides\nemployment for 18% of the labor force.\n\nIn 2010 Egypt's fertile area totaled about 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million\nacres), about one-quarter of which has been reclaimed from the desert after\nthe construction of the Aswan High Dam. The government aims to increase this\nnumber to 4.8 million hectares by 2030 through additional land reclamation.\nEven though only 3 percent of the land is arable, it is extremely productive\nand can be cropped two or even three times annually. However, the reclaimed\nlands only add 7 percent to the total value of agricultural\nproduction.[_citation needed_] Surface irrigation is forbidden by law in\nreclaimed lands and is only used in the Nile Valley and the Delta, the use of\npressurized irrigation and localized irrigation is compulsory in other parts\nof the country. Most land is cropped at least twice a year, but agricultural\nproductivity is limited by salinity which in 2011 affected 25% of irrigated\nagriculture to varying degrees. This is mainly caused by insufficient drainage\nas well as seawater intrusion in aquifers as a result of over-extraction of\ngroundwater, the latter primarily affects the Nile Delta. Thanks to the\ninstallation of drainage systems a reduction in salinized areas from about 1.2\nmillion hectares in 1972 to 900 000 hectares in 2010 was achieved.",

However, wheat\nyields in Egypt are expected to reduce nearly 20% by 2060. Other impacts of\nclimate change on agriculture include reduced water availability, increased\npests and diseases, and a shorter growing period in some places. Prices for\nimported food will increase as a result of climate change due to global\ndeclines in crop production. Hotter temperatures and increased drought will\nalso impact livestock, including cows and chickens. Heat and water stress\nreduces milk yield and quality, egg yield, and animals’ reproductive capacity.\nGiven increases in the human populations and decreases in milk production,\nmodels predict that milk availability will decrease by 40 kg per person by\n2064. Together, these climate change impacts on agriculture will threaten food\nsecurity in Egypt.",

By late 2024, total bank assets\nreached approximately 21 trillion Egyptian pounds (USD 420 billion), a\nsignificant rise from EGP 633 billion (USD 101 billion) in 2004.\n\nEgypt’s banking system dates back to 1856, evolving through privatization,\nmergers, and foreign bank exits, such as Société Générale's 2012 sale of\nNational Société Générale Bank to QNB Al Ahli. Despite private sector growth,\nstate-owned commercial banks remain dominant.\n\nFinancial inclusion has expanded, with 74.8% of Egyptians aged 15 and above\nusing financial accounts, reaching 52 million users by 2024. Usage spans\nbanks, Egypt Post, mobile wallets like Vodafone Cash and MobiCash, and prepaid\ncards like Meeza. Women’s financial inclusion grew 295% since 2016 thanks to\npolicies and initiatives aimed at empowering women financially, reaching\n68.8%, while youth participation rose 65% from 2020 to 2024, hitting 53.1%.\n\nThe fintech sector has expanded 5.5-fold since 2020, with 177 startups ranking\nEgypt 10th among emerging markets. Growth, driven by digital payments, lending\nplatforms, and B2B marketplaces, is bolstered by financial inclusion policies.\nWith over 60% of the population under 30, youth adoption is high, though\ncybersecurity risks, regulatory gaps, and digital literacy disparities remain\nchallenges."

However, the government has undertaken several initiatives to\nimprove the investment climate and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).\nThe Investment Law of 2017 was introduced to streamline procedures and\ninvestor incentives, and was followed by a new company law and bankruptcy law\nin 2018 and a customs law in 2020, all aimed at creating a more efficient\nbusiness environment. Alongside these legal amendments, efforts to simplify\ncompany registration and encourage foreign participation have contributed to\nmaking Egypt one of the leading FDI destinations in Africa between 2016 and\n2020.\n\nTo further enhance its economic attractiveness, Egypt has implemented fiscal\nreforms such as reducing corporate tax rates and cutting trade tariffs, aimed\nat increasing foreign investment and economic growth. At the same time, large-\nscale infrastructure projects, including transportation modernization, new\nurban communities, and the Suez Canal's expansion, have been pursued to reduce\nlogistical costs, enhance trade efficiency, and provide improved facilities\nfor investors.\n\nAs part of the reforms, Egypt introduced \"golden licenses\", a single-approval\nmechanism that allows investors to acquire land and begin operations without\nrequiring multiple approvals from various government bodies. The General\nAuthority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) oversees the program, which\naims to reduce bureaucracy and attract FDI. As of March 2024, 26 golden\nlicenses had been granted. Additionally, in July 2023, President El-Sisi\nratified Law No. 159 of 2023, which eliminated exemptions for state-owned\nenterprises, ensuring equal regulatory treatment for all investors.\n\nTo further encourage foreign capital inflows, the government has also\nintroduced a citizenship-by-investment program, offering residency and\ncitizenship in exchange for financial contributions.\n\nDespite these efforts, challenges persist. Issues like corruption and the need\nfor improved enforcement of regulatory frameworks continue to impact investor\nconfidence.

It also seeks to increase private sector participation by clearly\ndefining the state's economic role, enhancing governance of state-owned\nenterprises according to OECD standards, and promoting competitive neutrality.\nBy the final quarter of 2024, these reforms had led private investment to\nexceed public investment for the second consecutive quarter, representing over\nhalf of total investments.
