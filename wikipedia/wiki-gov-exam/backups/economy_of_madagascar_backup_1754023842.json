    "text": "Over the years, successive French colonial and independence-era governments\nhave sought to modernize Madagascar's economy. The first modern land use\nprojects were established by French settlers or Creole immigrants from the\nMascarene Islands in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They introduced\ncash crops such as coffee, sugarcane, vanilla, cloves, and sisal for export.\nThey also built small-scale mines to exploit the island's graphite, chromite,\nand uranium resources. To facilitate the processing and marketing of these\ncommodities, the immigrants established a number of financial and commercial\nenterprises and built a small, modern railroad system. They then brought some\nMalagasy into this modern sector of the economy, either as wage laborers and\nsharecroppers on the foreign-owned plantations, or as low-level employees in\nthe civil service or business enterprises. The foreign owners and managers,\nhowever, retained almost all of the benefits from these operations.\n\nAfter independence the Philibert Tsiranana regime did little to change the\nFrench domination of the modern sector of the economy, despite increasing\noutrage at this continued economic dependence. This anger, together with\ngrowing concern over an unequal distribution of wealth that left the southern\nand western parts of the island in relative poverty, caused the ouster of\nTsiranana in 1972 and a shift in economic policy. The new military regime led\nby Gabriel Ramanantsoa cut most ties with France and began to Malagachize the\neconomy. Slow progress toward this goal, however, helped to precipitate the\nend of the Ramanantsoa regime in mid-1975. Only with the rise of Didier\nRatsiraka to the presidency later that year did the takeover of formerly\nFrench-dominated enterprises begin in earnest.\n\nRatsiraka's policy of \"revolution from above\" went beyond confiscating or\nbuying out foreign firms and turning them over to Malagasy ownership; he\nintended to socialize the economy by nationalizing major enterprises. The\nstate acquired majority or minority ownership in nearly all large financial,\ntransportation, marketing, mining, and manufacturing enterprises. Firms left\nunder private control were required to buy and sell at state-controlled\nprices, and the state closely monitored the repatriation of profits. In the\nrural sector, Ratsiraka aimed to establish local farming cooperatives. Almost\nas important as this institutional reform was the regime's intention,\nannounced in an economic plan for the 1978-80 period, to increase dramatically\nthe level of government capital investment in all sectors of the economy in\norder to improve the availability of goods and services to all.\n\nBy the start of the 1980s, however, Ratsiraka's attempt to fashion viable\nsocialist institutions and to stimulate the economy through increased\ninvestment had failed to improve economic production and welfare. Economic\ngrowth throughout the 1970s had not kept pace with the expanding population.\nDespite the availability of significant agricultural and mineral resources,\nthe economy was less productive than at the start of the decade when the\naverage per capita income was already among the lowest in the world. The only\napparent effect of the enhanced level of investment, which reached all-time\nhighs in the 1978-80 period, was to put the country deeply in debt to foreign\ncreditors and, therefore, pave the way for a series of structural adjustment\nagreements signed with the IMF and the World Bank during the 1980s and the\nearly 1990s. Such agreements were necessary because as a 1993 World Bank study\npointed out, between 1971 and 1991 the per capita income of Malagasy dropped\n40 percent.\n\nEventually admitting that adoption of the socialist model of economic\ncentralization and state control was a mistake, the Ratsiraka regime in 1980\ninitiated a return to a more classic liberal economic model that the Albert\nZafy regime wholeheartedly adopted following its inauguration in 1993. The\npost-1980 Ratsiraka and Zafy regimes have overseen the privatization of\nparastatals, the disbanding of agricultural marketing boards, the ratification\nof more liberal investment codes favoring foreign investment, the\nprivatization of the banking industry, diversification of traditional,\nprimary-product exports, and greater investment in food production. The Zafy\nregime has made reinvigoration of the Malagasy economy its number-one\npriority.\n\nAs of 1994, the majority of Malagasy continued to earn their livelihoods in\nways fundamentally unchanged from those of their ancestors — small-scale farms\nsupporting traditional irrigated rice cultivation, dryland farming of cassava\nand other foods, zebu cattle herding, or the raising of cash crops.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, Donald J. Trump declared \"reciprocal tariffs\" of 47% on\nMadagascar. Madagascar, produces around 80% of the world's vanilla, and such\nexport was put at risk by Trump's new policy towards Madagascar exporters.",

Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration\nwith the private sector and donors and presented it at a \"Friends of\nMadagascar\" conference organized by the World Bank in Paris in July\n2002.[_citation needed_] Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the\nnew government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The\nMalagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principal priority\nand underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a\njoint public-private sector steering committee.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the\nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Malagasian\nartisan producers in Madagascar in 2002. The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council\nwas formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations\ncontinue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nThe government of former President Marc Ravalomanana was aggressively seeking\nforeign investment and had planned to tackle many of the obstacles to such\ninvestment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws,\nencouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active\npursuit of foreign investors. [_citation needed_]President Ravalomanana rose\nto prominence through his agro-foods TIKO company, and is known for attempting\nto apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the\ngovernment.[_citation needed_] Prior to Ravalomanana's resignation, concerns\nhad arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the\nactivities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment\nfor rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a\nproduction shortfall in the country.[_citation needed_]\n\nMadagascar's appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work\nforce. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were\norganized under the country's export processing zone (EPZ) system since it was\nestablished in 1989.[_citation needed_] The absence of quota limits on textile\nimports to the European market under the Lomé Convention helped stimulate this\ngrowth.[_citation needed_]\n\nPort Toamasina\n\nGrowth in output in 1992–97 averaged less than the growth rate of the\npopulation. Growth has been taken away by a decline in world coffee demand,\nand the erratic commitment of the government to economic reform. During a\nperiod of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly\nhigh, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a\ndispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001\nvirtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of\n2002. Real GDP dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of foreign investment dropped\nsharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an AGOA\nstandout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy\nrebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003.[_citation needed_] Currency\ndepreciation and rising inflation in 2004 hampered economic performance, but\ngrowth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the\nend of the year.[_citation needed_] In 2005, inflation was brought under\ncontrol by tight monetary policy of raising the _Taux Directeur_ (central bank\nrate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was\nexpected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.[_citation needed_]\n\nDuring Ravalomanana's presidency, the government adopted a series of business\nlaws and regulations, including the commercial companies law (2003), labor law\n(2003), regulations on the application of commercial companies law (2004),\npublic procurement law (2004), competition law (2005), foreign exchange law\n(2006), investment law (2007), and free zones and free enterprises law (2007).",
