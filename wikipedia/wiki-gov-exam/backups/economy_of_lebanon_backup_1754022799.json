After the\nwar, the central government regained its ability to control key port and\ngovernment facilities. As a result, GDP per capita expanded 353% in the 1990s.\nEconomic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and\nresilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances,\nbanking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the\nmain sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains\nsince the launch of \"Horizon 2000,\" the government's $20 billion\nreconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before\nIsrael's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity.\nReal GDP grew at an average annual rate of less than 3% per year for 1997 and\n1998 and only 1% in 1999. During 1992–98, annual inflation fell from more than\n100% to 5%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $6 billion from\n$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign payments\nsurpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable. Progress\nalso has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial\ninfrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of\nBeirut's central business district; the stock market reopened in January 1996,\nand international banks and insurance companies are returning. The government\nnonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund\nreconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting borrowing.\nReducing the government budget deficit is a major goal of the current\ngovernment. The gap between rich and poor grew in the 1990s, resulting in\npopular dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's\nbenefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding\ninfrastructure to improving living conditions.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability,\nBeirut's reconstruction was almost complete, and increasing numbers of\ntourists poured into the nation's resorts. The economy witnessed growth, with\nbank assets reaching over US$75 billion, Market capitalization was also at an\nall-time high, estimated at $10.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of\n2006. The month-long 2006 war severely damaged Lebanon's economy, especially\nthe tourism sector. Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure\nmainly in the real estate and tourism sectors, resulting in a comparatively\nrobust post war economy. Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon\ninclude Saudi Arabia (with US$1.5 billion pledged), the European Union (with\nabout $1 billion) and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of\nup to $800 million.\n\nGiven the frequent security turmoil it has faced, the Lebanese banking system\nhas adopted a conservative approach, with strict regulations imposed by the\ncentral bank to protect the economy from political instability. These\nregulations have generally left Lebanese banks unscathed by the 2008 financial\ncrisis. Lebanese banks remain, under the current circumstances, high on\nliquidity and reputed for their security. In late 2008, Moody's shifted\nLebanon's sovereign rankings from stable to positive, acknowledging its\nfinancial security. Moreover, with an increase of 51% in the Beirut stock\nmarket, the index provider MSCI ranked Lebanon the world's best performer in\n2008. Lebanon is one of the only seven countries in the world in which the\nvalue of the stock market increased in 2008. The Lebanese economy experienced\ncontinued resilience, growing 8.5 percent in 2008, 7 percent in 2009 and 8.8%\nin 2010. However, Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio remained one of the highest in\nthe world.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has significantly affected Lebanese economic and financial\nsituation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living\nin Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct\nconsequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A\nloss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also\nbeen registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate\nincreased with 170,000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the\nperiod between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and\nlosses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian\nrefugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every\nyear.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund issued a second report on Lebanon in October\n2015, where its expectations of the economic growth rate were lowered to 2%,\ncompared to the 2.5% growth rate of the first report, released in April 2015.\n\nIn October 2019, Lebanon witnessed nationwide protests that erupted over the\ncountry's deteriorating economic conditions. Thousands of demonstrations took\nto the streets of downtown Beirut, calling for the government of Prime\nMinister Saad al-Hariri to quit over \"its utter failure to stop the\ndeterioration of the economic and living conditions in the country\". The\nprotests began after the government announced to charge 20 cents per day for\nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) over social media apps, including\nWhatsApp, Facebook, and other applications.\n\nLebanon has a very high level of public debt and large external financing\nneeds. The 2010 public debt exceeded 150.7% of GDP, ranking fourth highest in\nthe world as a percentage of GDP, though down from 154.8% in 2009. At the end\n2008, finance minister Mohamad Chatah stated that the debt was going to reach\n$47 billion in that year and would increase to $49 billion if privatization of\ntwo telecoms companies did not occur. The Daily Star wrote that exorbitant\ndebt levels have \"slowed down the economy and reduced the government's\nspending on essential development projects\".\n\nDuring the early part of 2020, the central bank (BdL) defaulted on $90\nsovereign debt obligations and the government needed recourse to the IMF for a\nshortfall of $50 billion.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, the explosion of 2,750 tons ammonium nitrate in a Beirut\nport warehouse caused the destruction of the \"only large grain silo\" in the\ncountry, in addition to more than 200 people killed and several square\nkilometres of pulverised buildings in the downtown core of the city. By 9\nAugust, President of France Emmanuel Macron had counted over €250 million of\nglobal contributions to the relief effort. On 10 August, the government of\nHassan Diab resigned. The day before, IMF director Kristalina Georgieva had\nlaid down four conditions for the co-operation of her organization:\n\n* restoring the financial solvency of the state,\n* cutting losses at state-owned companies,\n* passing a law to regulate capital outflows and\n* setting up a social safety net.\n\nOn 14 August, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs (UNOCHA) launched a $565 million appeal for donors of aid to victims\nof the explosions. The UN effort was to focus on: meals, first aid, shelters,\nand repair of schools. Some of the money that Macron collected would be used\nby the UNOCHA."

    "text": "According to a World Bank report, Lebanon's economy which was structurally\nstrained before the Syrian shock suffered a real blow as an aftermath of the\nSyrian crisis which brought around 1.5 million Syrian refugees into Lebanon.\nThe GDP growth rate declined by around 1 percent in 2018. In August 2019, the\nUSD parallel exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate;\nthe official exchange rate for the USD had been £L1,507.5 since 1997, while\nthe parallel exchange rate was £L1,600 in the fall of 2019 and would increase\nto around £L4,200 in May 2020. The USD parallel exchange rate is increasing\nbecause of the dollar shortage in Lebanon. In a bid to lower the dollar price,\nthe central bank made an agreement with the licensed exchangers to make the\nofficial rates on offer at £L3,860/3,910. However, despite the central bank's\nefforts, on 23 June 2020, the black market dollar reached a staggering rate of\n£L 6,075 devaluing the Lebanese pound by 75%. This dollar shortage also caused\n785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020\nand caused 25,000 employees to lose their jobs. This economic crisis made\nLebanon's gross domestic product fall to about $44 billion, which was about\n$55 billion the year before. The crisis became worse when the COVID-19\npandemic affected the Lebanese economy. In 2020, the country defaulted for the\nfirst time on $30 billion in bonds and tried to seek help from the IMF but the\nnegotiations never reached fruition.\n\nThe liquidity crisis also lead to a restriction on the withdrawals from US\ndollar bank accounts. Depositors needed to preserve the value of their\nsavings, especially following press reports about possible haircuts and\nrestructuring of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real\nestate. For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate\ndeveloper, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5\nmillion. Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company,\nwhich lead to a rise of 500% in its price between the start of the liquidity\ncrisis and April 2021.\n\nThe already battered economy of Lebanon suffered fresh blow with the port\nblast on 4 August 2020. Economists have claimed that the blasts could result\nin the contraction of Beirut's GDP by around 20–25% for the year. The current\nfigure surpasses IMF's last forecast of 12% crash in GDP because of the\nongoing and increasing economic and political crisis in Lebanon.\n\nIn March 2021, Lebanon approved an emergency assistance package from the World\nBank worth $246 million in order to support struggling families and strengthen\nthe social safety and try to face the economic crisis.\n\nOn March 16, as the Lebanese pound jumped on the black market from £L13,000 to\n£L15,000 against the US dollar, protesters took to the streets, grocery stores\nclosed and bakeries threatened to close.\n\nAfter the meeting of the President Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Saad\nHariri on March 18, the Lebanese pound dropped from £L15,000 against the\ndollar on the black market to £L12,500.\n\nAs of 2023, Lebanon is considered by some to have become a failed state,\nsuffering from chronic poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.\nLebanon’s poverty rate have surged from 20 percent to over 80 percent after\n2019, driven by economic crises worsened by the 2020 Beirut explosion and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These crises have intensified resource shortages and\ndeepened reliance on sectarian patronage systems that have further entrenched\nsocietal divisions and accompanying political and economic stagnation."

    "section_name": "External debt",
    "text": "After the civil war, the Lebanese government resorted to massive borrowing to\nfinance its post-war restructuring. The yearly growth of gross debt between\n1993 and 1995 was 123 percent and between 1995 and 2000 was 171 percent.\nBetween 2005 and 2018, the yearly growth of debt has averaged around 22\npercent, and in comparison the GDP growth rate for the same period has been in\nsingle digits with an exception of 2009. This high debt has caused Lebanon to\nspend a big chunk of its revenues in debt servicing; on average, close to 45\npercent is spent by the government as interest payments. In 1996, interest\npayments made up almost 68 percent of that year's budget deficit. With debt\npiling up and growth being minuscule, Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio reached 178\npercent by the end of 2019, which makes it the third most indebted country\nafter Greece and Japan. In 2020, Beirut defaulted on a $1.2 billion external\nbond, the first sovereign default in its history. The nation is currently in\ndiscussions with a group of creditors about a possible restructuring of a\ndefaulted Eurobond. A successful restructuring would allow the country to\nagain access external credit markets."

    "text": "Lebanon's national currency, the Lebanese pound is pegged to the US dollar at\n£L15,000 to US$1. This fixed rate has been unstable due to the depreciating\nvalue of the pound in the black market. According to reports, the pound was\ntrading at £L8,100 to US$1 in 2019 on the black market. The causes of the\npound's depreciation can be traced back to the economy's dependence on\nimports. Lebanon in 2018 imported US$20 bn worth of goods and exported goods\nworth only US$3 bn. This trade deficit also widened as the remittances share,\nwhich was around 24 percent in 2008 declined to nearly 12 percent in 2018.\nThis coupled with geopolitical tensions of the region, caused the Pound-Dollar\npeg rate to wither. As a response, the central bank resorted to more borrowing\nand also issued a directive that required all money transfer offices to cash\nout transfers in the local currency, further exacerbating the dollar crunch."

    "text": "After a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August 2020 that killed at least\n200 people, the government, headed by Prime Minister Hassan Diab, announced\nthat his government was stepping down. In his speech, Mr. Diab said that\ncorruption cases were widespread in the country's political and administrative\nlandscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which\npose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the\ncountry.\n\nAccording to reports, the financial troubles and political inaction had caused\ngrowing anger and frustration among people who began protesting in October\nlast year. Protesters demanded an end to corruption and the resignation of\npolitical leaders including the then Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. This year,\nthe newly formed government under Diab faced the same accusations of\ncorruption. In November 2019, The central bank of Lebanon was accused of\nrunning a Ponzi scheme as it relied on fresh borrowing to service its debt.\nThe bank denied the allegations stating that its action was in par with the\n1963 Code of Money and Credit. Amidst the failing banking system, banks\nresorted to putting informal curbs on dollar withdrawals and international\ntransfers, stirring mass protests and police violence. The pandemic brought\nthe protests to a halt for some time but the port explosion in Beirut once\nagain brought people to the streets, who, as reports state, have lost faith in\nthe political elite. Some estimates state that half of Lebanon's population is\nliving near or below the poverty line and thousands of people have lost their\njobs. There have been incessant power cuts and some residents have been\ncalling the blackouts worse than those witnessed in the 1975–1990 civil war."

In\n2019, domestic wheat production measured 130,000 tons, while wheat imports\nmeasured 570,000 tons.\n\nThe food security of Lebanon is a subject of debate. On the one hand,\nadministrators of the UNESCWA used the World Food Programme in May 2016 to\nsell the story that the country imports up to 80% of its needs.

    "text": "The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Lebanon was valued at\n$9.6 billion in January 2019, down from $11.5 billion in January 2018\n\nLebanon was unable to attract significant foreign aid to help it rebuild from\nboth the long civil war (1975–89) and the Israeli occupation of the south\n(1978–2000). In addition, the delicate social balance and the near-\ndissolution of central government institutions during the civil war\nhandicapped the state as it sought to capture revenues to fund the recovery\neffort. Thus it accumulated significant debt, which by 2001 had reached $28\nbillion, or nearly 150% of GDP. Economic performance was sluggish in 2000 and\n2001 (zero growth in 2000, and estimates between 1.0 and 1.4% in 2001, largely\nattributed to slight increases in tourism, banking, industry, and\nconstruction). Unemployment is estimated at 14% for 2000 and 29% among the\n15-24-year age group, with preliminary estimates of further increases in 2001.\nHowever, many Lebanese expatriates have been able to return to the country due\nto the negative financial situations they are facing abroad, due to the global\neconomic crisis. Also, more job opportunities are attracting more Lebanese\nyouths for a chance to return and work in Lebanon, and also a benefit for the\nLebanese living in the country, graduating from universities."

In late 2000, the\ngovernment substantially reduced customs duties, adopted export promotion\nschemes for agriculture, decreased social security fees and restrictions on\ninvestment in real estate by foreigners, and adopted an open-skies policy,\nwith positive effects on trade in 1991. Nonetheless, the relative appreciation\nof the Lebanese currency has undermined competitiveness, with merchandise\nexports falling from 23% of GDP in 1989 to 4% in 2000.\n\nIn 2001, the government turned its focus to fiscal measures, Increasing\ngasoline taxes, reducing expenditures, and approving a value-added-tax that\nbecame effective in February 2002. Slow money growth and dollarization of\ndeposits have hampered the ability of commercial banks to finance the\ngovernment, leaving more of the burden to the central bank. This monetization\nof the fiscal deficit has put enormous pressure on central bank reserves,\nmitigated only slightly with the issuance of new Eurobonds over the past 2\nyears. The central bank has maintained a stable currency by intervening\ndirectly in the market, as well as low inflation, and succeeded in maintaining\ninvestors' confidence in debt. It has done so at a cost, however, as\ninternational reserves declined by $2.4 billion in 2000 and by $1.6 billion in\nthe first half of 2001.\n\nFor 2002, the government has put primary emphasis on privatization, initially\nin the telecom sector and electricity, with continued planning for sales of\nthe state airline, Beirut port, and water utilities. The government has\npledged to apply the proceeds of sales to reducing the public debt and the\nbudget deficit. In addition, it projects that privatization will bring new\nsavings as government payrolls are pared, interest rates decline, and private\nsector growth and foreign investment are stimulated. The government also is\ntackling the daunting task of administrative reform, aiming to bring in\nqualified technocrats to address ambitious economic programs, and reviewing\nfurther savings that can be realized through reforms of the income tax system.\nThe Lebanese Government faces major challenges in order to meet the\nrequirements of a fiscal adjustment program focusing on tax reforms and\nmodernization, expenditure rationalization, privatization, and improved debt\nmanagement.\n\nFaraya in Mount Lebanon Governorate. The Lebanese economy depends on its\ntourism sector throughout all seasons of the year. Tourists from Europe, GCC,\nand Arab countries visit Lebanon for various reasons.\n\nThe U.S. enjoys a strong exporter position with Lebanon, generally ranking as\nLebanon's fourth-largest source of imported goods. More than 160 offices\nrepresenting U.S. businesses currently operate in Lebanon. Since the lifting\nof the passport restriction in 1997 (see below), a number of large U.S.\ncompanies have opened branches or regional offices, including Microsoft,\nAmerican Airlines, Coca-Cola, FedEx, UPS, General Electric, Parsons\nBrinckerhoff, Cisco Systems, Eli Lilly, Computer Associates and Pepsi Cola.\nMexico has also many enterprises run by ethnic Lebanese, such as Carlos Slim's\nTelmex.\n\nSolidere shares are the most actively traded in the Beirut Stock Exchange. Its\nshare price in the Beirut Stock Exchange has risen sharply in the last year\nfrom around US$5.00 in early 2004 to close at US$17.50 on Friday, 23 December\n2005.\n\nIn 2025, Lebanon amended its banking secrecy laws under pressure from the IMF.\nThe reforms would allow independent auditors access to banking records from\nthe past 10 years in an effort to stop corruption and facilitate a larger\nrestructuring of the Lebanese banking industry."

Most unions went ahead\nwith the strike except the general worker's union.\n\n* Wages between minimal wage and £L1,200,000 ($800) were increased by £L200,000 ($133) to become £L700,000 (minimal wage) and £L1,400,000 ($933) respectively.\n* Wages more than £L1,200,000 up to £L1,700,000 ($1,133) were increased by £L300,000 ($200) to become £L1,500,000 ($1,000) and £L2,000,000 ($1,333).\n* Wages above £L1,800,000 ($1,200) were not increased.\n\nThe increase in wages was welcomed by most Lebanese but it also sparked\ncriticism by some worker's unions, saying that the increases were not up to\nexpectations, especially that employees earning more than $1200 were not\nentitled to raises. Others criticized the raises altogether citing that it\nwould burden small business that might end up closing altogether; those\ncritics were mainly opposition politicians.\n\nAs of 2013 World Bank analysis of Quality Life Index, it was estimated that:\n\n* 15% of the Lebanese people lives below the poverty line ($2,500)\n* 54% of the Lebanese people lives in the moderate middle class ($9,000) annually.  12% from 1998\n* 32% of the Lebanese people lives in the upper middle class ($15,000–27,000) annually.  19% from 1998\n* 7% of the Lebanese people lives in the highest upper class ($30,000 and above) annually  1% from 1998"
