    "text": "Since the first settlement by the British in 1625, through history the\n**economy of Barbados** was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been\nrecorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of\nthe desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. In the 1640s,\n\nBarbados shifted from small-scale mixed crop farming using indentured labor to\nlarge-scale sugar production, introduced by the Jewish community that\nimmigrated to Barbados when exiled from Dutch Brazil. Land was divided into\nlarge estate-plantations, with a labor-force that was almost entirely made up\nof enslaved men and women.\n\nSugar cane became the driving force in the economy of Barbados. Barbados soon\nhad built so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of\nwindmills per square mile in the world, after the Netherlands. For about the\nnext 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in\nthe Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados\nremained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production caught up in\ngeographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being\neclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop\nwell into the 20th century.\n\nWhile the emancipation of African slaves in the British Empire in 1833,\nnominally liberated the slaves, limited access to education and land kept the\nfreed as a disenfranchised underclass. As such, emphasis began to be placed on\nincreased labour rights as well as upward mobility and strong education to\ncombat plantation living.\n\nDuring the 1920s, politicians in Barbados started a push for more self-\ngovernment. As the 1940s–1950s rolled around, Barbados moved towards\ndeveloping political ties with neighbouring Caribbean islands. By 1958 the\nWest Indies Federation was proposed by the British government for Barbados and\nnine other Caribbean territories. The Federation was first led by the Premier\nof Barbados, however the experiment ended by 1962. Later, Barbados tried to\nnegotiate several other unions with other islands, yet it became likely that\nBarbados needed to move on. Subsequently, the island peacefully negotiated its\nindependence with the British Government and the island became independent at\nmidnight on November 30, 1966.",

    "text": "After the country became independent of the United Kingdom on 30 November 1966\nsugar cane still remained a chief money-maker for Barbados. The island's\npoliticians tried to diversify the economy from just agriculture. During the\n1950s–1960s visitors from both Canada and the United Kingdom started\ntransforming tourism into a huge contributor for the Barbadian economy. The\nman-made Deep Water Harbour port at Bridgetown had been completed in 1961, and\nthereafter the island could handle most modern oceangoing ships for shipping\nsugar or handling cargoes at the port facility.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, global companies started to recognise Barbados for\nits highly educated population. In May 1972 Barbados formed its own Central\nBank, breaking off from the East Caribbean Currency Authority (ECCA). By 1975\nthe Barbadian dollar was changed to a new fixed / constant rate of exchange\nrate with the US$ with the rate being changed to present day US$1 = BBD$1.98\n(BBD$1.00 = ~US$0.50).\n\nBy the 1980s a growing manufacturing industry was seen as a considerable\nearner for the Barbados economy. With manufacturing then being led by\ncompanies such as Intel Corporation and others, the Manufacturing industry\ncontributed greatly to the economy during the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n> Under the 1993 Wage and Price Protocol, workers and unions assented to a\n> one-time cut in real wages of about 9 percent and agreed to keep their\n> demands for future pay raises in line with increases in productivity. Firms\n> promised to moderate their price increases, the government maintained the\n> parity of the currency, and all parties agreed to the creation of a national\n> productivity board to provide better data on which to base future\n> negotiations.\n\nIn the early 1990s the country's economy was hit hard when real GDP per capita\ndeclined by 5.1% per year between 1989 and 1992 partly due to the 1990 oil\nprice spike. Barbados entered into an agreement with the International\nMonetary Fund financial assistance after a long and hard period of\nnegotiations between the IMF, the government of Barbados, labour unions and\nemployers. This led to a protocol on wages and prices in 1993. This helped\nprevent an inflationary spiral and restored the island's international\ncompetitiveness thereby leading to a period of long-term economic growth of\n2.7% between 1993 and 2000.\n\nAs one of the founding members, Barbados joined the World Trade Organization\n(WTO) on 1 January 1995. Following this, the Government of Barbados\naggressively tried to make the Barbados economy fully WTO compliant. This led\nto the collapse of much of the manufacturing industry of Barbados during the\nlate 1990s in favour of many companies like Intel and others moving to lower\ncost Asian economies. During the late 1990s more companies started to become\ninterested in Barbados' offshore sector, until it over took sugar as the new\nchief money maker. In 1999–2000 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD) \"blacklist\" was circulated with Barbados listed in error.\nThe negative fallout stymied new investment into Barbados' offshore sector for\nnearly two years as Barbados' authorities acted swiftly successfully proving\nthat Barbados' economy was regulated sufficiently to ward off financial\ncriminal activity and that it was not a \"tax haven\" as charged, but instead a\nlow-tax regime.\n\nAs the global recession hit in 2001, the offshore sector in Barbados slightly\ncontracted further, thereby making tourism the new chief money maker, after\nhaving earlier eclipsed manufacturing and sugar cane. The Government of\nBarbados further changed legislation to transform the Barbados economy into\none which fosters investment. This led to several new hotel developments. The\ngovernment continues to try maintaining constraint from personal involvement\nin the Hotel activity and instead seeks private investment into the Barbados\neconomy for future growth.[_citation needed_]\n\nSeveral large hotel projects like the Port Charles Marina project in\nSpeightstown helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996–99, and\nmore recently the new Hilton Hotel on Needhams Point, Saint Michael in 2005.\n\nVarious firms from Wall Street in New York provide routine economic analysis\nof the Barbadian economy. This has included such firms as Standard & Poor's\nand Moody's.",

The GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture 6%,\nindustry 16%, and services 78% (2000 est.) In 2001, it had a labor force of\n128,500, of which 10% were in agriculture, 15% in industry, and 75% in\nservices (1996 est.). The unemployment rate in 2003 was 10.7%, and the\ninflation rate in 2007 was 5.5%. The Barbadian government had estimated\nrevenues of $847 million (including grants) in 2000, and expenditures of $886\nmillion. The industrial production growth rate was -3.2%.\n\nOffshore finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and\nthere is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues its\nefforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate, which it met in the\n1990s, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatise remaining state\nowned Crown corporations of Barbados.\n\nThe main factors responsible for the improvement in economic activity include\nan expansion in the number of tourist arrivals, an increase in manufacturing,\nand an increase in sugar production. Recently, offshore banking and financial\nservices also have become an important source of foreign exchange and economic\ngrowth.\n\nEconomic growth has led to net increases in employment in the tourism sector,\nas well as in construction and other services sub-sectors of the economy. The\npublic service remains Barbados' largest single employer. Total labour force\nhas increased from 126,000 in 1993 to 140,000 persons in 2000, and\nunemployment has dropped significantly from over 20% in the early 1990s to\n9.3% at the end of 2000.\n\nThe Barbados government encourages the development in: financial services,\ninformatics, e-commerce, tourism, educational and health services, and\ncultural services for the future. In 2000 based on Barbados' level of growth –\n(at the time) Barbados was supposed to become the world's smallest developed\ncountry by 2008. This had then been restated as being achievable by around\n2025.\n\nIn May 2018 The Prime Minister Mia Mottley disclosed previously uncovered\nfinancial obligations of the state. The Prime Minister said that the new\ngovernment inherited 15 billion Barbados dollars of debt (about 7.5 billion US\ndollars). Disclosure of information about the current level of debt has led to\nan increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 137% to 175%. This is the fourth\nvalue in the world after Japan, Greece, and Sudan. Mia Mottley announced that\nnew government had no other choice than to ask the IMF to facilitate debt\nrestructuring. On 5 June 2018 Barbados didn't fulfill its obligation to pay\nthe 26th coupon on Eurobonds maturing in 2035. According to Cbonds, excluding\nthe disclosure of the true level of debt, on 7 June 2018 the country had 47\ndebt issues in circulation totaling 4.425 billion US dollars.",

    "text": "The manufacturing sector in Barbados has yet to recover from the recession of\nthe late 1980s when many bankruptcies occurred and almost one-third of the\nworkforce lost their jobs. Today, approximately 10,000 Barbadians work in\nmanufacturing. The electronics sector in particular was badly hit when the\nU.S. semi-conductor company, Intel, closed its factory in 1986. Except for\ntraditional manufacturing—such as sugar refining and rum distilling—Barbados's\nindustrial activity is partly aimed at the local market, which produces goods\nsuch as tinned food, drinks, and cigarettes. Many industrial estates are\nlocated throughout the island. A cement factory is located in St. Lucy.\n\nExport markets have been severely damaged by competition from cheaper\nCaribbean and Latin American countries. But domestic manufacturing also faces\nserious potential problems, as trade liberalisation means that the government\ncan no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported\ngoods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete with other regional\neconomies with lower wage costs and other overhead. The other significant\nindustrial employer is the petroleum sector. Oil deposits are located in the\nsouthern parishes, but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities. The\nisland's one small oil refinery closed in 1998 and moved refining to Trinidad\nand Tobago, where labour and other costs are cheaper."

    "text": "Tourism is Barbados's crucial economic activity and has been since the 1960s.\nAt least 10 per cent of the working population (some 13,000 people) are\nemployed in this sector, which offers a range of tourist accommodations from\nluxury hotels to modest self-catering establishments. After the recession\nyears, tourism picked up again in the mid-1990s, only to face another slowdown\nin 1999. This drop was in part due to increasing competition from other\nCaribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic, and in part to a reduction\nin visits from cruise ships as they shifted to non-Caribbean routes or shorter\nroutes such as the Bahamas. Cruise ship visitors totalled 445,821 in 1999, a\nreduction from 517,888 in 1997, but stay-over visitors rose to 517,869 in\n1999, setting a new record. Overall, the country witnessed over US$700 million\nin tourism receipts in 1999.\n\nA problem in Barbados is that tourist facilities are too densely concentrated\non the south coast, which is highly urbanised, while the Atlantic coast—with a\nrugged shoreline and large waves—is not suitable for beach tourism. There are\nfew large brand-name hotels, which makes marketing the island in the United\nStates difficult. On the other hand, the absence of conglomerates and package\ntours results in more direct tourist spending among the general population.\n\nBathsheba, Saint Joseph\n\nBarbados has numerous internationally known hotels. Time-shares are available,\nand many smaller local hotels and private villas that dot the island have\nspace available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of\nBarbados are popular, with the calm light-blue Caribbean Sea and their white\nand pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast, which faces the\nAtlantic Ocean, there are tumbling waves that are perfect for light surfing.\nSome areas remain risky to swimmers due to under-tow currents. The Crane beach\nwas named one of the top 10 best beaches in the world.\n\nShopping districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping.\nThere is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the Saint\nLawrence Gap. Other attractions include wildlife reserves (Graeme Hall Nature\nSanctuary), jewellery stores, scuba diving, helicopter rides, golf, festivals\n(the largest being the annual Crop Over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave\nexploration (Harrison's Cave), exotic drinks and fine clothes shopping."
