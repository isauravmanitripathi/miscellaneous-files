Banana production\nemploys, directly or indirectly, upwards of one-third of the work force. This\nsector is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events\naffecting commodity prices. The value of banana exports fell to less than 25%\nof merchandise trade earnings in 1998 compared to about 44% in 1994.\n\nIn view of the European Union's announced phase-out of preferred access of\nbananas to its markets, agricultural diversification is a priority. Dominica\nhas made some progress, with the export of small quantities of citrus fruits\nand vegetables and the introduction of coffee, patchouli, aloe vera, cut\nflowers, and exotic fruits such as mangoes, guavas, and papayas. Dominica has\nalso had some success in increasing its manufactured exports, with soap as the\nprimary product. Dominica also recently entered the offshore financial\nservices market.\n\nBecause Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches, development of\ntourism has been slow compared with that on neighboring islands. Nevertheless,\nDominica's high, rugged mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs,\nwaterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive destination. Cruise ship\nstopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and\nwaterfront facilities in the capital. Eco-tourism also is a growing industry\non the island.\n\nDominica is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The\nEastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues a common currency (the East\nCaribbean dollar) to all eight members of the ECCU. The ECCB also manages\nmonetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in\nits member countries. Dominica is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin\nInitiative (CBI). Its 1996 exports to the U.S. were $7.7 million, and its U.S.\nimports were $34 million. Dominica is also a member of the 15-member Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) and of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States\n(OECS).",

Additionally, there are\nother products like citrus, coconuts, cocoa, herbal oils and extracts.\n\nAgriculture accounts for about 20% of GDP and employs about 40% of the labor\nforce. Agricultural exports amounted to $19.1 million in 2001. Most crops are\nproduced on small farms, the 9,000 owners of which are banded together in\nabout 10 cooperatives; there are also several large farms that produce mostly\nbananas for export. Other major crops are coconuts and citrus fruits which are\ngrown in commercial quantities. Production for 1999 included coconuts, 11,000\ntons; grapefruit, 21,000 tons; lemons and limes, 1,000 tons; and oranges,\n8,000 tons. Fruits and vegetables are produced mostly for local consumption.",

The largest\nmanufacturer is Dominica Coconut Products, controlled by Colgate-Palmolive,\nwhich produces soap from coconuts. The factory has an agreement to sell an\nestimated 3 million bars of soap each year to Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.\nDominican soap is also exported throughout the region, but has recently\nencountered intensified competition from other regional producers, especially\nin the important export markets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThere are four plants to process limes and other citrus fruits; two bottling\nplants; two distilleries; four small apparel plants; and four small furniture\nfactories. Dominica exports water to its Caribbean neighbors; shoes, cement\nblocks, furniture, and soap and toiletries are also exported. Home industries\nproduce some leather work, ceramics, and straw products.\n\nSince the 1990s, the small manufacturing sector has been expanding at a modest\npace, including electronic assembly, rum, candles, and paints. The Trafalgar\nHydro Electric Power Station is now operational, making the island virtually\nenergy self-sufficient. Industry accounted for 23% of GDP in 2001.\n\nDominica has not yet been able to attract significant numbers of foreign\nmanufacturers, partly because its wage rates are relatively high and partly\nbecause its infrastructure is not suited to high-volume manufacturing. Like\nother islands, it seeks to attract investors with tax concessions and other\nfinancial inducements, but several offshore manufacturing plants have closed\nafter their duty-free concessions expired, normally a 10-year span."

These include global financial\ninstitutions including Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Canada, First Caribbean\nInternational Bank;\n\nThe largest Financial sectors are \"offshore banking, payment processing\ncompanies, and general corporate activities\". Regulation and supervision of\nthe financial services industry is the responsibility of the Financial Service\nUnit of the Commonwealth of Dominica (FSU) under the supervision of the\nMinistry of Finance.\n\nStarting in the mid-late 1990s, offshore financial centres, such as the\nCommonwealth of Dominica, came under increasing pressure from the OECD for\ntheir allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax\nregimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD\nthreatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other financial centres\non a \"black list\" and impose sanctions against them. However, the Commonwealth\nof Dominica successfully avoided being placed on the OECD blacklist by\ncommitting to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information\nexchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.\n\nDominica has tried to expand its base by building up offshore financial\nservices. So far, a relatively small number of offshore banks and other\ninternational business companies have registered in Dominica, but the\ngovernment is trying to attract more by making registration economical and\neasy. A Dominica-based International Business Company (IBC) can, for instance,\nbe formed over the Internet, and the government has also granted operating\nlicenses to several Internet gambling companies."
