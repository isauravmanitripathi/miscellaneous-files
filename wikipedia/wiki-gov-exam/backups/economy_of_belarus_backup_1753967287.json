As a post-\nSoviet transition economy, Belarus rejected most privatisation efforts in\nfavour of retaining centralised political and economic controls by the state.\nThe highly centralized Belarusian economy emphasizes full employment and a\ndominant public sector. It has been described as a welfare state practicing\nmarket socialism.[_not in body_] Belarus is the world's 74th-largest economy\nby GDP.\n\nAs of 2018[update], Belarus ranks 53rd from 189 countries on the United\nNations Human Development Index, and appeared in the group of states with\n\"very high development\". With an efficient health system, it has a very low\ninfant-mortality rate of 2.9 (compared to 6.6 in Russia or 3.7 in the United\nKingdom). The rate of doctors per capita is 40.7 per 10,000 inhabitants (the\nfigure is 26.7 in Romania, 32 in Finland, 41.9 in Sweden) and the literacy\nrate is estimated[_by whom?_] at 99%.

    "text": "Before the October Revolution, Belarus was a relatively backward and\nunderdeveloped country, heavily reliant on agriculture and with rural\noverpopulation, although it experienced a rapid economic and industrial growth\nafter the construction of railways in the late 19th century (with Minsk,\nVitsebsk, Hrodna, Pinsk and Homel becoming significant industrial centres. The\nSecond World War devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its\npopulation and suffered immense destruction of infrastructure. In the post-war\nyears, Belarus rapidly industrialised and became an important trade hub\nbetween the Soviet Union and Europe. Manufacturing became a pillar of its\neconomy emphasising tractors, heavy trucks, oil processing, metal-cutting\nlathes, synthetic fibres, TV sets, semi-conductors and microchips. In the\n1980s, more than half of the industrial personnel of Belarus worked for\nenterprises with over 500 employees. Among the Soviet republics, it had an\nunusually high export rate of its products, about 80%, and was the most\ntechnologically advanced. Because of its role as a producer of products made\nfrom raw materials imported from the Soviet Union, Belarus was called \"the\nSoviet assembly shop\".\n\nSince the disintegration of the Soviet Union and under Lukashenko's\nleadership, Belarus has maintained government control over key industries and\neschewed the large-scale privatizations seen in other former Soviet republics.\n\nThe period between 1996 and 2000 was also characterised by significant\nfinancial distress, in particular in 1998 and 1999 as a result of the\nfinancial and economic crisis in Russia. This resulted primarily in a sharp\nincrease in prices and the devaluation of the national currency, a decline in\ntrade with Russia and other CIS countries, growth in inter-enterprise arrears,\nand overall deterioration of the country's balance of payments. Extreme\ntension within the foreign exchange market was the key factor that\ndestabilized the economy in 1998 and 1999. In 1999, consumer prices grew by\n294%.[_citation needed_]\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the national economy demonstrated steady and dynamic\ngrowth. The GDP grew at an average rate of 7.4 percent, peaking in 2005 at 9.2\npercent. This growth was mainly a result of the performance of the industrial\nsector, which grew on average more than 8.7 percent per year, with a high of\n10.4 percent in 2005. Potatoes, flax, hemp, sugarbeets, rye, oats, and wheat\nare the chief agricultural products. Dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and chickens\nare raised. Belarus has only small reserves of petroleum and natural gas and\nimports most of its oil and gas from Russia. The main branches of industry\nproduce tractors and trucks, earth movers for use in construction and mining,\nmetal-cutting machine tools, agricultural equipment, motorcycles, chemicals,\nfertilizer, textiles, and consumer goods. The chief trading partners are\nRussia, Ukraine, Poland, and Germany.\n\nThe Belarus GDP grew 9.9% in 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, GDP grew\n8.2%. GDP further grew in 2008 by 10%.\n\nAnalysis of foreign direct investment to Belarus between 2002 and 2007 shows\nthat nearly 80% of FDI was geared into the service sector, while industrial\nconcerns accounted for 20%. Agricultural FDI was negligible at 1%."

    "text": "Shortly before the 2010 presidential election, average salaries in Belarus\nwere increased by the government to $500 per month. It is believed to be one\nof the main reasons for the crisis in 2011. Other reasons for the crisis were\nstrong governmental control in the economy, a discount rate lower than\ninflation and the budget deficit.\n\nIn January 2011, Belarusians started to convert their savings from Belarusian\nrubles to dollars and euros. The situation was influenced by rumors of\npossible devaluation of the ruble. Exchange rates in Belarus are centralized\nby the government-controlled National Bank of Belarus. The National Bank was\nforced to spend $1 billion of the foreign reserves to balance the supply and\ndemand of currency On March 22, it stopped the support to banks. The National\nBank also didn't change the exchange rate significantly (3,000 BYR per dollar\non January 1 and 3,045 BYR on April 1), so the increased demand of dollars and\neuro exhausted cash reserves of banks. In April and May 2011, many people had\nto wait for several days in queues to buy dollars in the exchange booths. In\nApril, Belarusian banks were given informal permission of government to\nincrease the exchange rate to 4,000 BYR for 1 dollar (later 4,500 BYR), but\nfew people started to sell dollars and euro. On May 24, the ruble was\nofficially devalued by 36% (from 3,155 to 4,931 BYR per 1 dollar). But the\nshortage of the currency retained. As a result of the shortage, a black market\nof currency was created. In July 2011, the black market exchange rate was\nnearly 6,350 BYR per 1 dollar, in August, it reached 9,000 BYR per 1 dollar.\n\nIn September 2011, National Bank of Belarus introduced a free exchange market\nsession to determine a market value of the ruble. From November 2011 to March\n2012, the exchange rate was Br 8,000—8,150 per dollar, but it started to rise\nin April 2012 and reached Br 8,360 per dollar on 10 July 2012.\n\nRecovery from the crisis was difficult due to isolation of the Belarusian\ngovernment from the EU and US.\n\nThe crisis strongly affected the economy. Inflation reached 108.7% in 2011.\nAverage salary (counted in dollars) decreased from $530 in December 2010 to\n$330 in May 2011. In May 2012, the average salary reached $436 (3,559,600 with\n8,165 per dollar). Refinancing rate (analogue of discount rate) rose from\n10.5% in December 2010 to 45% in December 2011 and fell to 32% in June 2012.\nIn November 2011, interest rates of several banks reached 120% in rubles."

In 1992, industry in Belarus accounted for\napproximately 38 percent of GDP, down from 51 percent in 1991. This figure\nreflects a decline in the availability of imported inputs (especially crude\noil and deliveries from Russia), a drop in investments, and decreased demand\nfrom Belarus's traditional export markets among the former Soviet republics.\nBelarus's economy was also affected by decreased demand for military\nequipment, traditionally an important sector.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 1994, gross industrial output declined by 19 percent. At the beginning of\n1995, every industrial sector had decreased output, including fuel and energy\nextracting (down by 27 percent); chemical and oil refining (18 percent);\nferrous metallurgy (13 percent); machine building and metal working (17\npercent); truck production (31 percent); tractor production (48 percent);\nlight industry (33 percent); wood, paper, and pulp production (14 percent);\nconstruction materials (32 percent); and consumer goods (16\npercent).[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 1996, a Free Economic Zone (FEZ) area was set up in Brest.

The share of agriculture in GDP declined by over\n10-percentage point to 14 percent in 1997. This happened, irrespective to the\npresident's economic strategy of self-sufficiency in food production in 2001.\nThe decline in overall agriculture production partly could be attributed to\nunfavorable weather conditions (like floods), but declines in the harvests of\npotatoes, vegetables, and other crops that grow mostly in private plots were\nsmaller than in produce grown by collective farms. Also, animal breeding has\nbeen in decline and it is concentrated in the state sector. Subsidization of\nagricultural sector in Belarus amounted to 1–2 percent of GDP in the form of\ndirect government credits, advanced payments for the realization of state\norders of major crops, at strongly negative interest rates. Additionally, a\nstate budget fund, Agriculture Support Fund provides funds to compensate food\nproducers for the costs of inputs (fertilizers and equipment) that amounted to\nanother 1–2 percent of GDP in 1996–1997. Finally, the Central Bank of Belarus\nissued subsidized credits to the agriculture sector at an interest rate of\nhalf the refinance rate. However, in spite of the fact that state-owned and\ncollective farms cultivate about 83 percent of agricultural land and benefited\nthe most from the government subsidies, privately run farms and private plots\nproduce more than 40 percent of gross output.[_citation needed_]\n\nBelarus can be divided into three agricultural regions: north (flax, fodder,\ngrasses, and cattle), central (potatoes and pigs), and south (pastureland,\nhemp, and cattle). Belarus' cool climate and dense soil are well suited to\nfodder crops, which support herds of cattle and pigs, and temperate-zone crops\n(wheat, barley, oats, buckwheat, potatoes, flax, and sugar beets). Belarus'\nsoils are generally fertile, especially in the river valleys, except in the\nsouthern marshy regions.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe greatest changes in agriculture in the first half of the 1990s were a\ndecline in the amount of land under cultivation and a significant shift from\nlivestock to crop production because crops had become a great deal more\nprofitable than before. The sales price for crops generally increased more\nthan production costs, while inputs for livestock (such as imported fodder)\nhave increased in price beyond livestock sales prices.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe food processing industry in the country is led primarily by state concern\nBelgospischeprom and local municipal or regional owned production\nfacilities.[_citation needed_]"

Most Minsk-born start-ups\nrelocated to other European countries, only in 2021 more than 15,000 IT\nworkers left the country. More than 3000 tech workers had gone to Ukraine,\n1800 employees of 30 companies with total investments of $76.8 million moved\nto Poland, at least 41 companies went to Lithuania.

Almost\n40% of companies faced refuses in new contracts due to sanctions, imposed on\nBelarus.\n\nIn August 2021 Lukashenko accused HTP companies of working 'for the USA for\nhalf prices'. On April 4, 2022, he commanded to 'deal with the tech workers'\nand return the IT sector into equal terms with other industries. In March 2022\ntaxes for IT companies were raised."

On 24 June 2021, the EU introduced the sectoral sanctions that\naffected petroleum and fertilizer production, tobacco industry, supply of\ndual-purpose equipment, and access to the EU financial markets by the\nBelarusian government. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on\nBelneftekhim concern and its subordinated companies. They were later\nsuspended, but not cancelled. In 2021, USA renewed them and imposed new\nsanctions on several companies. In 2021, UK and Canada imposed similar\nsanctions on several companies.\n\nIn 2020–2021, Belarusian authorities made different efforts to circumvent the\nWestern sanctions. They also hid the statistics to prevent revealing the ways\nused to circumvent them and track their effects. In particular, access to data\nregarding production and exports of the sanctioned goods became restricted to\npublic. In October 2021, Belstat started to hide data regarding exports of\ntractors and trucks. Overall classified exports in January–August 2021 is\nestimated at US$8.2 billion. In September 2021, Alexander Lukashenko mentioned\nminister of industry Petr Parkhomchik [ru] and vice prime minister Yuri\nNazarov (politician) [ru] as the people who organized the circumvention of\nsanctions. He also accused several workers of state factories of gathering\ninformation about the ways used to circumvent the sanctions, and he threatened\nthem with imprisonment. 13 workers from Grodno Azot fertilizer factory, Naftan\noil refinery, BMZ steel mill and Belarusian Railway were arrested by the\nBelarusian KGB in a possible connection with this statement. It was reported\nthat some of them were accused of state treason. At least two of them were\nlater released. In June 2021, Belorusneft was removed from subordination of\nBelneftekhim. This move was believed to be connected with the sanctions."
