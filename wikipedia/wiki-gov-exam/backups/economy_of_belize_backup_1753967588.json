    "text": "Belize's economy depended on forestry until well into the 20th century.\nLogwood, used to make dye, was Belize's initial main export. However, the\nsupply outstripped the demand, especially as Europeans developed man-made dyes\nwhich were less expensive. Loggers turned to mahogany, which grew in abundance\nin the country's forests. The wood was prized for use in cabinets, ships, and\nrailroad carriers.\n\nWhile many merchants and traders became wealthy from the mahogany industry,\nups and downs in the market had a large impact on the economy. In addition,\nnew mahogany trees weren't being planted because mahogany trees grow slowly;\nthe rate of natural regrowth necessitated a large, long-term investment in\ntree farming, which was not made. As the 19th century progressed, loggers were\nforced to go deeper into the forests to find the trees, increasing labour\ncosts.\n\nVariations in mahogany exports over long periods of time were linked to the\naccessible supply of the resource. Thus, improvements in hauling methods\nhelped the cutters satisfy increasing demands for mahogany by enabling them to\nextract timber from areas in the interior that had been previously\ninaccessible to them. Immediately after the introduction of cattle in the\nearly 19th century, tractors in the 1920s, and lorries in the 1940s,\nproduction levels rose dramatically.\n\nWhen the supply of accessible timber dwindled and logging became too\nunprofitable in the 20th century, the country's economy shifted to new\nsectors. Cane sugar became the principal export and recently has been\naugmented by expanded production of citrus, bananas, seafood, and apparel. The\ncountry has about 8,090 km2 of arable land, only a small fraction of which is\nunder cultivation. To curb land speculation, the government enacted\nlegislation in 1973 that requires non-Belizeans to complete a development plan\non land they purchase before obtaining title to plots of more than 10 acres\n(40,000 m2) of rural land or more than one-half acre (2,000 m2) of urban land.",
