Record high Gold price 2023 earned Ghana 15.6 billion $\nof exports.\n\nThe Ghanaian domestic economy in 2012 revolved around services, which\naccounted for 50% of GDP and employed 28% of the work force. Besides the\nindustrialization associated with minerals and oil, industrial development in\nGhana remains basic, often associated with plastics (such as chairs, plastic\nbags, razors, and pens). 53.6% of Ghana's workforce were employed in\nagriculture in 2013.[_outdated statistic_]\n\nGhana embarked on a currency re-denomination exercise from the Cedi (₵) to the\nnew currency, Ghana Cedi (GH₵) in July 2007. The transfer rate is 1 Ghana Cedi\nfor every 10,000 Cedis.\n\nGhana became the largest gold-producing country in Africa after overtaking\nSouth Africa in 2019. The country is also the second-largest cocoa producer\n(after Ivory Coast). Ghana is rich in diamonds,  manganese or manganese ore,\nbauxite, and oil. Most of its debt was cancelled in 2005, but government\nspending was later allowed to balloon. Coupled with a plunge in oil prices,\nthis led to an economic crisis that forced the government to negotiate a $920\nmillion extended credit facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in\nApril 2015. Bloomberg rated Ghana currency Cedi as the strongest performing\ncurrency in the World April 2025 against the Dollar reducing its debt burden.",

Biomass is Ghana's dominant energy resource in terms of\nendowment and consumption, with the two primary bio-fuels consumed being\nethanol and biodiesel. To that effect, the Ghana ministry of Energy in 2010\ndeveloped its energy sector strategy and development plan. Highlights of the\nstrategy include sustaining the supply and efficient use of wood fuels while\nensuring that their utilization does not lead to deforestation.\n\nThe plan would support private sector investments in the cultivation of bio-\nfuel feedstock, the extraction of bio-oil, and refining it into secondary\nproducts, thereby creating financial and tax incentives. The Ghana Renewal\nEnergy Act provides the necessary fiscal incentives for renewable energy\ndevelopment by the private sector, and also details the control and management\nof bio-fuel and wood fuel projects in Ghana. The Ghana National Petroleum\nAuthority (NPA) was tasked by the Renewable Energy Act 2011 to price Ghana's\nbio-fuel blend in accordance with the prescribed petroleum pricing formula.\n\nThe combined effects of climate change and global economic turbulence had\ntriggered a sense of urgency among Ghanaian policymakers, industry and\ndevelopment practitioners to find sustainable and viable solutions in the area\nof bio-fuels.\n\nBrazil, which makes ethanol from maize and sugarcane, is currently the world's\nlargest bio-fuel market."

Acting on that goal, in 2008 Ghana passed the _Electronic\nCommunications Act_ and the _Electronic Transactions Act_ , which established\nthe legal framework for governing information technology. In November 2011,\nthe Deputy Minister for Communications and Technology announced the\ndevelopment of a national cyber security strategy, aimed at combating cyber\ncrime and securing critical infrastructure.\n\nIn June 2012, the National Information Technology Agency announced a national\ncomputer emergency response team \"strategy\" designed to co-ordinate government\nresponse to cyber-attacks, both internal and external.

However, many of its citizens\nparticularly those in Accra cannot afford the housing prices which is a trait\nof most major cities globally particularly in the West. Kumasi is growing at a\nfaster rate than Accra, and there is less competition in its real estate\nmarket. The gross rental income tax of Ghana is withheld at 10%, capital gains\nare taxed at 15% with a 5% gift tax imposed on the transfer of properties and\nGhana's real estate market is divided into 3 areas: public sector real estate\ndevelopment, emerging private sector real estate development, and private\nindividuals. The activities of these 3 groups are facilitated by the Ghanaian\nbanks and the primary mortgage market which has demonstrated enormous growth\npotential. Recent developments have given birth to a boom in the construction\nsector, including the housing and public housing sector generating and\ninjecting billions of dollars annually into the Ghanaian economy. The real\nestate market investment perspective and attraction comes from Ghana's\ntropical location and robust political stability. An increasing number of the\nGhanaian populace are investing in properties, and the Ghana government is\nempowering the private sector in the real estate direction."
