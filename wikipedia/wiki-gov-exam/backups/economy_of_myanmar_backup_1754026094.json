    "text": "Under the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of\nsocial hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and\nChristianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom.\nIntegrated into the world economy by force, economic growth in Burma was\ndriven by the extractive industries and cash crop agriculture, and the country\nhad the second-highest GDP per capita in Southeast Asia. However, much of the\nwealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans. The country became the\nworld's largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other\ncolonies like India suffered mass starvation. The British followed the\nideologies of Social Darwinism and the free market, and opened up the country\nto a large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the\ngreatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s. Historian Thant Myint-U\nstates, \"This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was\nequivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year.\" By\nthen, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and\nMoulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The\nBurmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a \"racism that\ncombined feelings of superiority and fear\".\n\nCrude oil production, an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung, was taken over by\nthe British and put under Burmah Oil monopoly. British Burma began exporting\ncrude oil in 1853. It produced 75% of the world's teak. The wealth was\nhowever, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In the 1930s,\nagricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices\ndeclined and did not recover for several decades.\n\nDuring the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, the British followed a\nscorched earth policy. They destroyed the major government buildings, oil\nwells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the\nJapanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies. After independence,\nthe country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed.\nWith the loss of India, Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from\nthe British. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime\nMinister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was\ndeclared the owner of all land. The government tried to implement an eight-\nyear plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy which caused\nsome inflation.",

It permitted modest\nexpansion of the private sector, allowed some foreign investment, and received\nmuch needed foreign exchange. Than Shwe advocated for some deregulation\neconomic policies, despite his relaxation of some restrictions on Burma's\neconomy, his economic policies have been often criticized as ill-planned. Shwe\nrelaxed some state control over the economy, and was a supporter of Burma's\nparticipation in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). He also\noversaw a large crackdown on corruption, which saw the sackings of a number of\ncabinet ministers and regional commanders in 1997. Shwe advocated for Crony\ncapitalism. The economy was rated in 2009 as the least free in Asia (tied with\nNorth Korea). All basic market institutions are suppressed. Private\nenterprises were often co-owned or indirectly owned by state. The corruption\nwatchdog organisation Transparency International in its 2007 Corruption\nPerceptions Index released on 26 September 2007 ranked Burma the most corrupt\ncountry in the world, tied with Somalia.\n\nThe national currency is the kyat. Burma currently has a dual exchange rate\nsystem similar to Cuba. The market rate was around two hundred times below the\ngovernment-set rate in 2006. In 2011, the Burmese government enlisted the aid\nof the International Monetary Fund to evaluate options to reform the current\nexchange rate system, to stabilise the domestic foreign exchange trading\nmarket and reduce economic distortions. The dual exchange rate system allows\nfor the government and state-owned enterprises to divert funds and revenues,\nwhile also giving the government more control over the local economy and\nmaking it possible to temporarily subdue inflation.\n\nInflation averaged 30.1% between 2005 and 2007. In April 2007, the National\nLeague for Democracy organised a two-day workshop on the economy. The workshop\nconcluded that skyrocketing inflation was impeding economic growth. \"Basic\ncommodity prices have increased from 30% to 60% since the military regime\npromoted a pay rise for government workers in April 2006,\" said Soe Win, the\nmoderator of the workshop. \"Inflation is also correlated with corruption.\"\nMyint Thein, an NLD spokesperson, added: \"Inflation is the critical source of\nthe current economic crisis.\"\n\nIn recent years, China and India attempted to strengthen ties with Myanmar for\nmutual benefit.

Editing help is available. _(\nMarch 2024)_\n---|---\n\nIn 2011, when new President Thein Sein's government came to power, Burma\nembarked on a major policy of reforms including anti-corruption, currency\nexchange rate regulation, foreign investment laws and taxation. Foreign\ninvestments increased from US$300 million in 2009–10 to a US$20 billion in\n2010–11 by about 6567%. Large inflow of capital results in stronger Burmese\ncurrency, kyat by about 25%. In response, the government relaxed import\nrestrictions and abolished export taxes. Despite current currency problems,\nBurmese economy is expected to grow by about 8.8% in 2011. After the\ncompletion of 58-billion dollar Dawei deep seaport, Burma is expected be at\nthe hub of trade connecting Southeast Asia and the South China Sea, via the\nAndaman Sea, to the Indian Ocean receiving goods from countries in the Middle\nEast, Europe and Africa, and spurring growth in the ASEAN region.\n\nIn 2012, the Asian Development Bank formally began re-engaging with the\ncountry, to finance infrastructure and development projects in the country.\nThe $512 million loan is the first issued by the ADB to Myanmar in 30 years\nand will target banking services, ultimately leading to other major\ninvestments in road, energy, irrigation and education projects.\n\nIn March 2012, a draft foreign investment law emerged, the first in more than\n2 decades. This law oversees the unprecedented liberalisation of the economy.\nIt for example stipulates that foreigners no longer require a local partner to\nstart a business in the country and can legally lease land. The draft law also\nstipulates that Burmese citizens must constitute at least 25% of the firm's\nskilled workforce, and with subsequent training, up to 50–75%.\n\nOn 28 January 2013, the government of Myanmar announced deals with\ninternational lenders to cancel or refinance nearly $6 billion of its debt,\nalmost 60 per cent of what it owes to foreign lenders. Japan wrote off US$3\nBillion, nations in the group of Paris Club wrote off US$2.2 Billion and\nNorway wrote off US$534 Million.\n\nMyanmar's inward foreign direct investment has steadily increased since its\nreform. The country approved US$4.4 billion worth of investment projects\nbetween January and November 2014.\n\nAccording to one report released on 30 May 2013, by the McKinsey Global\nInstitute, Burma's future looks bright, with its economy expected to quadruple\nby 2030 if it invests in more high-tech industries. This however does assume\nthat other factors (such as drug trade, the continuing war of the government\nwith specific ethnic groups, etc.) do not interfere.\n\nAs of October 2017, less than 10% of Myanmar's population has a bank account.\nAs of 2016–17 approximately 98 percent of the population has smartphones and\nmobile money schemes are being implemented without the use of banks similar to\nAfrican countries.",

    "text": "Myanmar's economy has been in economic crisis since the coup d’état in\nFebruary 2021. On April 30, 2021, the United Nations Development Programme\nnoted that the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état could\nreverse economic gains made over the last sixteen years. Overall, Myanmar’s\neconomy under SAC rule is defined by stagnation, inflation, capital flight,\nand fractured governance. With no political resolution in sight, prospects for\nrecovery and inclusive growth remain bleak. The SAC’s economic strategy\nprioritizes regime survival through resource extraction and coercive controls,\nsuch as forced currency conversions and price fixing. This erratic and\nreactionary governance has undermined investor confidence and distorted\nmarkets.\n\nUnder the military-led State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar’s economy\nhas sharply declined, becoming the weakest in Southeast Asia. In fiscal year\n2024-25, real GDP is projected to contract by 1%, continuing a prolonged\ndownturn following an 18% collapse post-coup. Agriculture shrank by 4%, while\nindustry and services showed no growth. As the formal economy contracts,\ninformal and illicit sectors have expanded. Myanmar is now the world’s largest\nopium producer and a major hub for synthetic drugs and online scam centers.\nForeign investment has plummeted, with FDI approvals dropping from over $5\nbillion in fiscal year 2019-20 to $662 million in fiscal year 2023-24.\nInternational sanctions, financial blacklisting, and growing regulatory\nopacity have further discouraged engagement.\n\nPoverty has surged nationwide, with 77% of households now poor or near-poor,\nup from 58% in 2017. High inflation—driven by extensive money printing—peaked\nat 35% in 2022 and remains elevated, particularly for food and transport. Real\nwages have fallen across sectors, deepening household vulnerability. Labour\nshortages have worsened due to mass outmigration, particularly after the 2024\nconscription law. An estimated one-fifth of the population has left their\ncommunities due to conflict or hardship, draining the workforce and reducing\nproductivity. Trade declined in 2023 after a brief rebound, with exports down\n$4 billion and land border trade sharply reduced in 2024. The financial sector\nremains weak, with liquidity shortages, low public trust, and a shrinking\nmicrofinance industry.\n\nWhen the kyat fell by a third of its pre-coup value, the central bank then\nsold $600 million worth of foreign reserves (10% of the entire country's\ntotal) to prop up the kyat. By April 2022, reserves dwindled, foreign\ninvestment fell and remittances plummeted. This led the junta to impose\ncapital controls and import restrictions which led to shortages of diabetes\nand cancer medicines.\n\nThe overall loss of skilled workers has contributed to a 9–11% GDP contraction\nsince 2020. With the SAC prioritizing military aims over economic and human\ndevelopment, Myanmar faces a prolonged human resource crisis that could impact\nits economic recovery for decades.",

    "text": "Myanmar's economy depends heavily on sales of precious stones such as\nsapphires, pearls and jade. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's\nrubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and\nhue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Burma's \"_Valley of\nRubies_ \", the mountainous Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay, is\nnoted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires. Burma's gemstone\nindustry is a cornerstone of the Burmese economy with exports topping $1\nbillion.\n\nIn 2007, following the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Myanmar, human\nrights organisations, gem dealers, and US First Lady Laura Bush called for a\nboycott of a Myanmar gem auction held twice yearly, arguing that the sale of\nthe stones profited the dictatorial regime in that country. Debbie Stothard of\nthe Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma stated that mining operators used drugs\non employees to improve productivity, with needles shared, raising the risk of\nHIV infection. Richard W. Hughes, a Bangkok-based gemologist makes the point\nthat for every ruby sold through the junta, another gem that supports\nsubsistence mining is smuggled over the Thai border.\n\nThe Chinese have also been the chief driving force behind Burma's gem mining\nindustry and jade exports. The industry is completely under Chinese hands at\nevery level, from the financiers, concession operators, all the way to the\nretail merchants that own scores of newly opened gem markets. One Chinese-\nowned jeweller reportedly controls 100 gem mines and produces over 2,000\nkilograms of raw rubies annually. Since the privatization of the gem industry\nduring the 1990s, Burmese jewelers and entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have\ntransformed Burma's gem industry into new retail jewelry shops, selling\ncoveted pieces of expensive jewelry to customers mainly hailing from Hong Kong\nand Taiwan.\n\nThe permits for new gem mines in Mogoke, Mineshu and Nanyar state will be\nissued by the ministry according to a statement issued by the ministry on 11\nFebruary. While many sanctions placed on the former regime were eased or\nlifted in 2012, the US has left restrictions on importing rubies and jade from\nMyanmar intact. According to recent amendments to the new Myanmar foreign\ninvestment law, there is no longer a minimum capital requirement for\ninvestments, except in mining ventures, which require substantial proof of\ncapital and must be documented through a domestic bank. Another important\nclarification in the investment law is the dropping of foreign ownership\nrestrictions in joint ventures, except in restricted sectors, such as mining,\nwhere FDI will be capped at 80 per cent.\n\nMyanmar is famed for its production of Golden South Sea Pearls. In recent\nyears, the countries has auctioned its production in Hong Kong, first\norganized by Belpearl company in 2013 to critical acclaim and premium prices\ndue to strong Chinese demand. Notable pearls include the New Dawn of Myanmar,\na 19mm round golden pearl which sold to an anonymous buyer for undisclosed\nprice.",

Near the Mingaladon Industrial Park,\nfor example, Japanese-owned factories have risen from the \"debris\" caused by\n\"decades of sanctions and economic mismanagement.\" Japanese Prime Minister\nShinzō Abe has identified Burma as an economically attractive market that will\nhelp stimulate the Japanese economy. Among its various enterprises, Japan is\nhelping build the Thilawa Port, which is part of the Thilawa Special Economic\nZone, and helping fix the electricity supply in Yangon.\n\nJapan is not the largest investor in Myanmar. \"Thailand, for instance, the\nsecond biggest investor in Myanmar after China, is forging ahead with a bigger\nversion of Thilawa at Dawei, on Myanmar's Tenasserim Coast ... Thai rulers\nhave for centuries been toying with the idea of building a canal across the\nKra Isthmus, linking the Gulf of Thailand directly to the Andaman Sea and the\nIndian Ocean to avoid the journey round peninsular Malaysia through the Strait\nof Malacca.\" Dawei would give Thailand that connection."

    "text": "China, by far the biggest investor in Burma, has focused on constructing oil\nand gas pipelines that \"crisscross the country, starting from a new terminus\nat Kyaukphyu, just below Sittwe, up to Mandalay and on to the Chinese border\ntown of Ruili and then Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province\". This would\nprevent China from \"having to funnel oil from Africa and the Middle East\nthrough the bottleneck around Singapore\".\n\nSince the Myanmar's military junta took power as the State Peace and\nDevelopment Council junta in 1988, the ties between China's People's\nLiberation Army and Myanmar's military forces developed and formalised key\nties between the two states. China became Myanmar's key source of aid, loans\nand other financial assistance. China remained Myanmar's biggest foreign\ninvestor in 2013 even after the economy opened up to other providers like\nJapan and India. Chinese monetary assistance allowed China to gain structural\npower of Myanmar and a dominant position within the natural resource sector.\nDuring this period, an underdeveloped Burmese industrial sector was driven in\npart by Chinese investment and consumption of a few key extractive sectors\nsuch as mining, driving domestic production away from consumer goods sectors\nlike textiles and electronics.\n\nYanlonkyine Gate on the Myanmar-China Border within Kokang Self-Administered\nZone in 2019.\n\nLegal two-way trade between Burma and mainland China reached US$1.5 billion\nannually by 1988 and additional Chinese trade, investment, economic, and\nmilitary aid was sought to invigorate and jumpstart the re-emerging Burmese\neconomy.[_citation needed_] An influx of foreign capital investment from\nmainland China, Germany, and France has led to the development of new\npotential construction projects across Burma. Many of these infrastructure\nprojects are in the hands of Chinese construction contractors and civil\nengineers with various projects such as irrigation dams, highways, bridges,\nground satellite stations, and an international airport for Mandalay. Burmese\nentrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have also established numerous joint\nventures and corporate partnerships with mainland Chinese State-owned\nenterprises to facilitate the construction of oil pipelines that potentially\ncould create thousands of jobs throughout the country.[_citation needed_]\nPrivate Chinese companies rely on the established overseas Chinese bamboo\nnetwork as a conduit between mainland China and Burmese Chinese businesses to\nnavigate the local economic landscape and facilitate trade between the two\ncountries. Mainland China is now Burma's most important source of foreign\ngoods and services as well as one of the most important sources of capital for\nforeign direct investment (FDI) in the country. In the fiscal year 2013, Chin\naccounted for 61 percent of all foreign direct investment. Between 2007 and\n2015, Chinese FDI increased from US$775 million to US$21.867 billion\naccounting for 40 percent of all FDI in the country. Much of this investment\nwent into Burma's energy and mining industries. Chinese private firms account\nfor 87% percent of total legal cross-border trade at Ruili and have a\nconsiderable amount of structural power over the illicit economy of Myanmar.\nChinese structural power over Burma's structure of finance also allows China\nto maintain a dominant position within the country's natural resource sector,\nprimarily Burma's latent oil, gas, and uranium sectors. China's position as\nthe country's primary investor also allows it to be its largest consumer of\nits extractive industries. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises have set their\nsights on Burma's high-value natural resource industries such as raw jade\nstones, teak and timber, rice, and marine fisheries."

    "text": "The level of international aid to Burma ranks amongst the lowest in the world\n(and the lowest in the Southeast Asian region)—Burma receives $4 per capita in\ndevelopment assistance, as compared to the average of $42.30 per capita.\n\nIn April 2007, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified the\nfinancial and other restrictions that the military government places on\ninternational humanitarian assistance in the Southeast Asian country. The GAO\nreport, entitled \"Assistance Programs Constrained in Burma,\" outlines the\nspecific efforts of the Burmese government to hinder the humanitarian work of\ninternational organisations, including by restricting the free movement of\ninternational staff within the country. The report notes that the regime has\ntightened its control over assistance work since former Prime Minister Khin\nNyunt was purged in October 2004.\n\nFurthermore, the reports states that the military government passed guidelines\nin February 2006, which formalised Burma's restrictive policies. According to\nthe report, the guidelines require that programs run by humanitarian groups\n\"enhance and safeguard the national interest\" and that international\norganisations co-ordinate with state agents and select their Burmese staff\nfrom government-prepared lists of individuals. United Nations officials have\ndeclared these restrictions unacceptable.\n\n> The shameful behavior of Burma's military regime in tying the hand of\n> humanitarian organizations is laid out in these pages for all to see, and it\n> must come to an end,\" said U.S. Representative Tom Lantos (D-CA). \"In\n> eastern Burma, where the military regime has burned or otherwise destroyed\n> over 3,000 villages, humanitarian relief has been decimated. At least one\n> million people have fled their homes and many are simply being left to die\n> in the jungle.\"\n\nUS Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) said that the report \"underscores\nthe need for democratic change in Burma, whose military regime arbitrarily\narrests, tortures, rapes and executes its own people, ruthlessly persecutes\nethnic minorities, and bizarrely builds itself a new capital city while\nfailing to address the increasingly urgent challenges of refugee flows,\nillicit narcotics and human trafficking, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other\ncommunicable diseases.\""
