    "text": "As a relatively small principality founded in 1852, Montenegro's economy was\noriginally wholly based in agriculture, but it began developing an industrial\neconomy at the turn of the 20th century. Growth was hampered by its small\npopulation, lack of raw materials, an underdeveloped transport network, and a\ncomparatively low rate of domestic and international investment.\n\nThe first industrial enterprises built in Montenegro were wood mills, an oil\nrefinery, a brewery, salt works, and electric power plants. Economic\ndevelopment was interrupted by several wars, including the First Balkan War\n(1912–13), World War I (1914–18), and World War II (1939–45). Throughout the\nfirst half of the 20th century, agriculture continued to dominate Montenegro's\neconomic activity."

Its\nindustrial sector included the generation of electricity, steel and aluminum\nproduction, coal mining, forestry and wood processing, textiles, and tobacco\nmanufacturing, while international trade, shipping, and tourism became\nincreasingly important by the late 1980s."

    "text": "Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, Montenegro's\nentire industrial production system effectively collapsed, leading to\nshortages of many goods and skyrocketing prices for them. Due to its political\nalliance with Serbia and favourable geographic location, with access to the\nAdriatic Sea and a shipping-link to Albania across Lake Skadar, Montenegro\nbecame a hub for smuggling activity during the 1990s. The smuggling of petrol\nand cigarettes, in particular, became a de facto legalised practice within the\ncountry."

    "text": "In 1997, Milo Đukanović took control of Montenegro's ruling party, the\nDemocratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, and began severing political\nties with Serbia. He blamed the policies of Serbian President Slobodan\nMilošević for the overall decline of the Montenegrin economy. Resurgent\ninflation led the Montenegrin government to \"dollarize\" the economy, adopting\nthe German mark as its dominant currency. These economic policies also led to\na revision in 2003 of the relationship between the two countries from a\nfederal republic to a much looser political union of Serbia and Montenegro, in\nwhich the Montenegrin government assumed responsibility for its own economic\npolicies.\n\nThe union did not last and on 21 May 2006, the people of Montenegro voted by\nreferendum to declare independence from Serbia."

As of\n2008, Montenegro received more foreign investment per capita than any other\nnation in Europe.\n\nIn the first half of 2012, Montenegro exported goods, mostly metals, worth\n€182.3 million, which was 14.6% less than in the same period of the preceding\nyear. Its major export partners include Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, and Hungary. Montenegro's imports in the first half of 2012,\nmostly food, oil, and electrical energy, were worth €864.9 million, which was\n2.6% more than the same period in 2011. Its major import partners include\nSerbia, Greece, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in\nMontenegro is Services with 15,496 companies followed by Retail Trade and\nWholesale Trade with 11,200 and 6,839 companies respectively."

In 2019 its\nallowable draft was reported as 12.8m and several private storage tanks exist\non site, to service trade.

    "text": "In July 2006 prior to EU integration efforts a survey document was produced by\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management for the EU-funded\nproject _Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy of Montenegro_. The\nStatistical Office of Montenegro learned as late as November 2021 how to\ncollect its data in formats acceptable to the European Commission.\n\nSince 2010 agricultural trade relations between the EU and Montenegro have\nbeen governed by the EU-Montenegro Stabilisation and Association Agreement,\nand with the exception of beef, sugar and wine all agricultural products\noriginating in Montenegro can enter the EU duty free. The EU has a large agri-\nfood trade surplus with Montenegro, and exports meat, dairy and food\npreparations. The EU mainly imports vegetables such as mushrooms, wine and\noils from Montenegro.\n\nIt was reported by the EC Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural\nDevelopment in March 2019 that the share of agriculture in Montenegro's GDP\nwas 8%. Agricultural land accounts for 38% of the total. Olives and citrus\nfruits are grown in the coastal region, while seasonal vegetables and tobacco\nare produced in the central areas. In the north of the country ungulates\ndominate the farming. The largest share of the land consists of pasture and\ngrassland.\n\nMontenegro became a member of the UN International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment (IFAD) in 2015, which notes that the rural population represents\none-third of the total. In 2019 the IFAD focused its activities \"on the key\nchallenges of better connectivity and higher productivity by (i) fostering the\ngraduation of micro and small agricultural holdings from the current non-\nviable subsistence-type agriculture toward semi-commercial and commercial\nagriculture, through investments in pro-poor rural infrastructure, (ii)\npromoting the aggregation of smallholders within inclusive value chain\nclusters and (iii) supporting the proactive role of municipalities to deploy\ninvestment to promote inclusion for entire sectors of the rural population.\"\n\nOver the years 2009 to 2019 the World Bank contributed a development project\ncalled the _Montenegro Institutional Development and Agriculture Strengthening\nProject_ , by which (amongst other highlights) the food safety system was\nupgraded in EU compliant manners, a Border Inspection Post with veterinary and\nphyto-sanitary controls was established in the Port of Bar, an electronic farm\nregister was created, procedures for the classification of farm and food\nestablishments were completed according to EU norms, and the Veterinary\nDiagnostic Laboratory in Podgorica was accredited in ISO 17025 analysis\nmethods."
