    "text": "Denmark has a modern high-income and highly developed mixed economy, dominated\nby the service sector with 80% of all jobs; about 11% of employees work in\nmanufacturing and 2% in agriculture. The nominal gross national income per\ncapita was the ninth-highest in the world at $68,827 in 2023.\n\nCorrecting for purchasing power, per capita income was Int$57,781 or 10th-\nhighest globally. The income distribution is relatively equal but inequality\nhas somewhat increased during the last decades. In 2017, Denmark had the\nseventh-lowest Gini coefficient (a measure of economic inequality) of the then\n28 European Union countries. With 5,932,654 inhabitants as of 1 January 2023,\nDenmark has the 38th largest national economy in the world measured by nominal\ngross domestic product (GDP), and the 52nd largest in the world measured by\npurchasing power parity (PPP). Among OECD nations, Denmark has a highly\nefficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at\nroughly 26.2% of GDP.\n\nDenmark has a very long tradition of adhering to a fixed exchange-rate system\nand still does so today. It is unique among OECD countries to do so while\nmaintaining an independent currency: the Danish Krone, which is pegged to the\neuro. Though eligible to join the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),\nDanish voters in a referendum in 2000 rejected exchanging the krone for the\neuro. Whereas Denmark's neighbours like Norway, Sweden, Poland and the United\nKingdom generally follow inflation targeting in their monetary policy, the\npriority of Denmark's central bank is to maintain exchange rate stability.\nConsequently, the central bank has no role in a domestic stabilization policy.\n\nIn an international context, a relatively large proportion of the population\nis part of the labour force, in particular because the female participation\nrate is very high. 78.8% of all 15-to-64-year-olds were active on the labour\nmarket in 2017, the sixth-highest number among all OECD countries. With a 4.8%\nunemployment rate, unemployment is relatively low in comparison to other\nEuropean countries, where the average unemployment rate is 6.7%. The labour\nmarket is traditionally characterized by a high degree of union membership\nrates and collective agreement coverage. Denmark invests heavily in active\nlabor market policies and the concept of flexicurity has been important\nhistorically.\n\nDenmark is an example of the Nordic model, characterized by an internationally\nhigh tax level, and a correspondingly high level of government-provided\nservices (e.g. health care, child care and education services). There are also\nincome transfers to various groups, such as retirees, disabled people, the\nunemployed, and students. Altogether, the amount of revenue from taxes paid in\n2017 amounted to 46.1% of GDP. The Danish fiscal policy is generally\nconsidered healthy. The net government debt is very close to zero, amounting\nto 1.3% of GDP in 2017. The Danish fiscal policy is characterized by a long-\nterm outlook, taking into account likely future fiscal demands. During the\n2000s, a challenge was perceived to government expenditures in future decades.\nIt was ultimately a challenge to fiscal sustainability from demographic\ndevelopment, in particular higher longevity. Responding to this, age\neligibility rules for receiving public age-related transfers were changed.\nSince 2012, calculations of future fiscal challenges, from both the government\nand independent analysts, have generally perceived Danish fiscal policy to be\nsustainable. In recent years, it was considered overly sustainable."

    "text": "Development of real GDP per capita, 1820 to 2018\n\nDenmark's long-term economic development has largely followed the same pattern\nas other Northwestern European countries. In most of recorded history Denmark\nhas been an agricultural country with most of the population living on a\nsubsistence level. Since the 19th century, Denmark has gone through an intense\ntechnological and institutional development. The material standard of living\nhas experienced formerly unknown rates of growth, and the country has been\nindustrialized and later turned into a modern service society.\n\nAlmost all of the land area of Denmark is arable. Unlike most of its\nneighbours, Denmark has not had extractable deposits of minerals or fossil\nfuels, except for the deposits of oil and natural gas in the North Sea, which\nstarted playing an economic role only during the 1980s. On the other hand,\nDenmark has had a logistic advantage through its long coastal line and the\nfact that no point on Danish land is more than 50 kilometers from the sea – an\nimportant fact for the whole period before the industrial revolution when sea\ntransport was cheaper than land transport. Consequently, foreign trade has\nalways been very important for the economic development of Denmark.\n\nDanish silver penning from the time of Valdemar I of Denmark.\n\nAlready during the Stone Age there was some foreign trade, and even though\ntrade has made up only a very modest share of total Danish value added until\nthe 19th century, it has been decisive for economic development, both in terms\nof procuring vital import goods (like metals) and because new knowledge and\ntechnological skills have often come to Denmark as a byproduct of goods\nexchange with other countries. The emerging trade implied specialization which\ncreated demand for means of payments, and the earliest known Danish coins date\nfrom the time of Svend Tveskæg around 995.\n\nCount Otto Thott was the foremost representative of mercantilist thought in\nDenmark.\n\nImprovements in shipping technology allowed traders to sail around Jutland and\ninto the Baltic Sea directly, and Danish warships collected the Sound Toll\nfrom these mainly Dutch merchants, in exchange for protection. Nordic rulers\nbefore the mid-seventeenth century welcomed the Dutch merchants for their\nefficient shipping services and inflow of investments which boosted industrial\ndevelopment. According to economic historian Angus Maddison, Denmark was the\nsixth-most prosperous country in the world around 1600. The population size\nrelative to arable agricultural land was small so that the farmers were\nrelatively affluent, and Denmark was geographically close to the most dynamic\nand economically leading European areas since the 16th century: the\nNetherlands, the northern parts of Germany, and Britain. Still, 80 to 85% of\nthe population lived in small villages on a subsistence level.\n\nMercantilism was the leading economic doctrine during the 17th and 18th\ncentury in Denmark, leading to the establishment of monopolies like Asiatisk\nKompagni, development of physical and financial infrastructure like the first\nDanish bank Kurantbanken in 1736 and the first \"kreditforening\" (a kind of\nbuilding society) in 1797, and the acquisition of some minor Danish colonies\nlike Tranquebar.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century major agricultural reforms took place that\nentailed decisive structural changes. However, the Napoleonic Wars caused\nCopenhagen to lose its status as an international centre of finance and trade.\nPolitically, mercantilism was gradually replaced by liberal thoughts among the\nruling elite. Following a monetary reform after the Napoleonic wars, the\npresent Danish central bank Danmarks Nationalbank was founded in 1818.\n\nThere exists national accounting data for Denmark from 1820 onwards thanks to\nthe pioneering work of Danish economic historian Svend Aage Hansen. They find\nthat there has been a substantial and permanent, though fluctuating, economic\ngrowth all the time since 1820. The period 1822–94 saw on average an annual\ngrowth in factor incomes of 2% (0.9% per capita) From around 1830 the\nagricultural sector experienced a major boom lasting several decades,\nproducing and exporting grains, not least to Britain after 1846 when British\ngrain import duties were abolished. When grain production became less\nprofitable in the second half of the century, the Danish farmers made an\nimpressive and uniquely successful change from vegetarian to animal production\nleading to a new boom period. Parallelly industrialization took off in Denmark\nfrom the 1870s. At the turn of the century industry (including artisanry) fed\nalmost 30% of the population.\n\nDuring the 20th century agriculture slowly dwindled in importance relative to\nindustry, but agricultural employment was only during the 1950s surpassed by\nindustrial employment. The first half of the century was marked by the two\nworld wars and the Great Depression during the 1930s. After World War II\nDenmark took part in the increasingly close international cooperation, joining\nthe OECD, IMF, WTO, and from 1972 the European Economic Community, later\nEuropean Union. Foreign trade increased heavily relative to GDP. The economic\nrole of the public sector increased considerably, and the country was\nincreasingly transformed from an industrial country to a country dominated by\nproduction of services. The years 1958–73 were an unprecedented high-growth\nperiod. The 1960s are the decade with the highest registered real per capita\ngrowth in GDP ever, i.e. 4.5% annually.\n\nAs a chairman of the Danish Economic Council and of several policy-preparing\ncommissions, Professor Torben M. Andersen has played an important role in\nDanish economic policy debates for the last decades.\n\nDuring the 1970s Denmark was plunged into a crisis, initiated by the 1973 oil\ncrisis leading to the hitherto unknown phenomenon stagflation. For the next\ndecades the Danish economy struggled with several major so-called \"balance\nproblems\": High unemployment, current account deficits, inflation, and\ngovernment debt. From the 1980s economic policies have increasingly been\noriented towards a long-term perspective, and gradually a series of structural\nreforms have solved these problems. In 1994 active labour market policies were\nintroduced that via a series of labour market reforms have helped reducing\nstructural unemployment considerably. A series of tax reforms from 1987\nonwards, reducing tax deductions on interest payments, and the increasing\nimportance of compulsory labour market-based funded pensions from the 1990s\nhave increased private savings rates considerably, consequently transforming\nsecular current account deficits to secular surpluses. The announcement of a\nconsistent and hence more credible fixed exchange rate in 1982 has helped\nreducing the inflation rate.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century new economic policy issues have\nemerged. A growing awareness that future demographic changes, in particular\nincreasing longevity, could threaten fiscal sustainability, implying very\nlarge fiscal deficits in future decades, led to major political agreements in\n2006 and 2011, both increasing the future eligibility age of receiving public\nage-related pensions. Mainly because of these changes, from 2012 onwards the\nDanish fiscal sustainability problem is generally considered to be solved.\nInstead, issues like decreasing productivity growth rates and increasing\ninequality in income distribution and consumption possibilities are prevalent\nin the public debate.\n\nThe global Great Recession during the late 2000s, the accompanying Euro area\ndebt crisis and their repercussions marked the Danish economy for several\nyears. Until 2017, unemployment rates have generally been considered to be\nabove their structural level, implying a relatively stagnating economy from a\nbusiness-cycle point of view. From 2017/18 this is no longer considered to be\nthe case, and attention has been redirected to the need of avoiding a\npotential overheating situation.\n\nIn 2022 the popularity of Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss\nbegan greatly affecting the Danish economy. The pharmaceutical industry\ncontributed two thirds of growth that year, and 1.7 points of the 1.9% year-\nover-year growth in the first quarter of 2023. As of August 2023[update] Novo\nNordisk's market capitalization—Europe's second-largest, after LVMH—exceeded\nthe size of the entire national economy, and it is the largest payer of\ncorporate taxes to the Danish state. Economists discussed whether the\ngovernment needed to publish data including and excluding the company; as the\nenormous economic growth did not similarly increase employment, data including\nNovo Nordisk is misleading regarding the Danish business cycle. Some worried\nthat the nation might become overdependent on the company, similar to what\nhappened to the economy of Finland with Nokia, or that Novo Nordisk's success\nmight cause Dutch disease."

    "text": "Average per capita income is high in an international context. According to\nthe World Bank, gross national income per capita was the tenth-highest in the\nworld at $55,220 in 2017. Correcting for purchasing power, income was\nInt$52,390 or 16th-highest among the 187 countries.\n\nDuring the last three decades household saving rates in Denmark have increased\nconsiderably. This is to a large extent caused by two major institutional\nchanges: A series of tax reforms from 1987 to 2009 considerably reduced the\neffective subsidization of private debt implicit in the rules for tax\ndeductions of household interest payments. Secondly, compulsory funded pension\nschemes became normal for most employees from the 1990s. Over the years, the\nwealth of the Danish pension funds have accumulated so that in 2016 it\nconstituted twice the size of Denmark's GDP. The pension wealth consequently\nis a very important both for the life-cycle of a typical individual Danish\nhousehold and for the national economy. A large part of the pension wealth is\ninvested abroad, thus giving rise to a fair amount of foreign capital income.\nIn 2015, average household assets were more than 600% of their disposable\nincome, among OECD countries second only to the Netherlands. At the same time,\naverage household gross debt was almost 300% of disposable income, which is\nalso at the highest level in OECD. Household balance sheets are consequently\nvery large in Denmark compared to most other countries. Danmarks Nationalbank,\nthe Danish central bank, has attributed this to a well-developed financial\nsystem."

    "text": "Income inequality has traditionally been low in Denmark. According to OECD\nfigures, in 2000 Denmark had the lowest Gini coefficient of all countries.\nHowever, inequality has increased during the last decades. According to data\nfrom Statistics Denmark, the Gini coefficient for disposable income has\nincreased from 22.1 in 1987 to 29.3 in 2017. The Danish Economic Council found\nin an analysis from 2016 that the increasing inequality in Denmark is due to\nseveral components: Pre-tax labour income is more unequally distributed today\nthan before, capital income, which is generally less equally distributed than\nlabour income, has increased as share of total income, and economic policy is\nless redistributive today, both because public income transfers play a smaller\nrole today and because the tax system has become less progressive.\n\nIn international comparisons, Denmark has a relatively equal income\ndistribution. According to the CIA World Factbook, Denmark had the twentieth-\nlowest Gini coefficient (29.0) of 158 countries in 2016. According to data\nfrom Eurostat, Denmark was the EU country with the seventh-lowest Gini\ncoefficient in 2017. Slovakia, Slovenia, Czechia, Finland, Belgium and the\nNetherlands had a lower Gini coefficient for disposable income than Denmark."

    "text": "The Danish labour market is characterized by a high degree of union membership\nrates and collective agreement coverage dating back from _Septemberforliget_\n(The September Settlement) in 1899 when the Danish Confederation of Trade\nUnions and the Confederation of Danish Employers recognized each other's right\nto organise and negotiate. The labour market is also traditionally\ncharacterized by a high degree of flexicurity, i.e. a combination of labour\nmarket flexibility and economic security for workers. The degree of\nflexibility is in part maintained through active labour market policies.\nDenmark first introduced active labour market policies (ALMPs) in the 1990s\nafter an economic recession that resulted in high unemployment rates. Its\nlabour market policies are decided through tripartite cooperation between\nemployers, employees and the government. Denmark has one of the highest\nexpenditures on ALMPs and in 2005, spent about 1.7% of its GDP on labour\nmarket policies. This was the highest amongst the OECD countries. Similarly,\nin 2010 Denmark was ranked number one amongst Nordic countries for expenditure\non ALMPs.\n\nDenmark's active labour market policies particularly focus on tackling youth\nunemployment. They have had a \"youth initiative\" or the Danish Youth\nUnemployment Programme in place since 1996. This includes mandatory activation\nfor those unemployed under the age of 30. While unemployment benefits are\nprovided, the policies are designed to motivate job-seeking. For example,\nunemployment benefits decrease by 50% after 6 months. This is combined with\neducation, skill development and work training programs. For instance, the\nBuilding Bridge to Education program was started in 2014 to provide mentors\nand skill development classes to youth that are at risk of unemployment. Such\nactive labour market policies have been successful for Denmark in the short-\nterm and the long-term. For example, 80% of participants in the Building\nBridge for Education program felt that \"the initiative has helped them to move\ntowards completing an education\". On a more macro scale, a study of the impact\nof ALMPs in Denmark between 1995 and 2005 showed that such policies had\npositive impact not just on employment but also on earnings. The effective\ncompensation rate for unemployed workers has been declining for the last\ndecades, however. Unlike in most Western countries there is no legal minimum\nwage in Denmark.\n\nA relatively large proportion of the population is active on the labour\nmarket, not least because of a very high female participation rate. The total\nparticipation rate for people aged 15 to 64 years was 78.8% in 2017. This was\nthe 6th-highest number among OECD countries, only surpassed by Iceland,\nSwitzerland, Sweden, New Zealand and the Netherlands. The average for all OECD\ncountries together was 72.1%.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the unemployment rate was 5.7% in 2017. This places\nunemployment in Denmark somewhat below the EU average, which was 7.6%. 10 EU\nmember countries had a lower unemployment rate than Denmark in 2017.\n\nAltogether, total employment in 2017 amounted to 2,919,000 people according to\nStatistics Denmark.\n\nThe share of employees leaving jobs every year (for a new job, retirement or\nunemployment) in the private sector is around 30% – a level also observed in\nthe U.K. and U.S.- but much higher than in continental Europe, where the\ncorresponding figure is around 10%, and in Sweden. This attrition can be very\ncostly, with new and old employees requiring half a year to return to old\nproductivity levels, but with attrition bringing the number of people that\nhave to be fired down."

    "text": "As a small open economy, Denmark is very dependent on its foreign trade. In\n2017, the value of total exports of goods and services made up 55% of GDP,\nwhereas the value of total imports amounted to 47% of GDP. Trade in goods made\nup slightly more than 60% of both exports and imports, and trade in services\nthe remaining close to 40%.\n\nMachinery, chemicals and related products like medicine and agricultural\nproducts were the largest groups of export goods in 2017. Service exports were\ndominated by freight sea transport services from the Danish merchant navy.\nMost of Denmark's most important trading partners are neighbouring countries.\nThe five main importers of Danish goods and services in 2017 were Germany,\nSweden, United Kingdom, United States and Norway. The five countries from\nwhich Denmark imported most goods and services in 2017 were Germany, Sweden,\nthe Netherlands, China and United Kingdom.\n\nAfter having almost consistently an external balance of payments current\naccount deficit since the beginning of the 1960s, Denmark has maintained a\nsurplus on its BOP current account for every year since 1990, with the single\nexception of 1998. In 2017, the current account surplus amounted to\napproximately 8% of GDP. Consequently, Denmark has changed from a net debtor\nto a net creditor country. By 1 July 2018, the net foreign wealth or net\ninternational investment position of Denmark was equal to 64.6% of GDP,\nDenmark thus having the largest net foreign wealth relative to GDP of any EU\ncountry.\n\nAs the annual current account is equal to the value of domestic saving minus\ntotal domestic investment, the change from a structural deficit to a\nstructural surplus is due to changes in these two national account components.\nIn particular, the Danish national saving rate in financial assets increased\nby 11 per cent of GDP from 1980 to 2015. Two main reasons for this large\nchange in domestic saving behaviour were the growing importance of large-scale\ncompulsory pension schemes and several Danish fiscal policy reforms during the\nperiod which considerably decreased tax deductions of household interest\nexpense, thus reducing the tax subsidy to private debt."

    "text": "The building of Danmarks Nationalbank, the central bank of Denmark, built by\nthe Danish architect Arne Jacobsen.\n\nThe Danish currency is the Danish krone, subdivided into 100 øre. The krone\nand øre were introduced in 1875, replacing the former rigsdaler and skilling.\nDenmark has a very long tradition of maintaining a fixed exchange-rate system,\ndating back to the period of the gold standard during the time of the\nScandinavian Monetary Union from 1873 to 1914. After the breakdown of the\ninternational Bretton Woods system in 1971, Denmark devalued the krone\nrepeatedly during the 1970s and the start of the 1980s, effectively\nmaintaining a policy of \"fixed, but adjustable\" exchange rates. Rising\ninflation led to Denmark declaring a more consistent fixed exchange-rate\npolicy in 1982. At first, the krone was pegged to the European Currency Unit\nor ECU, from 1987 to the Deutsche Mark, and from 1999 to the euro.\n\nAlthough eligible, Denmark chose not to join the European Monetary Union when\nit was founded. In 2000, the Danish government advocated Danish EMU membership\nand called a referendum to settle the issue. With a turn-out of 87.6%, 53% of\nthe voters rejected Danish membership. Occasionally, the question of calling\nanother referendum on the issue has been discussed, but since the 2008\nfinancial crisis, opinion polls have shown a clear majority against Denmark\njoining the EMU, and the question is not high on the political agenda\npresently.\n\nMaintenance of the fixed exchange rate is the responsibility of Danmarks\nNationalbank, the Danish central bank. As a consequence of the exchange rate\npolicy, the bank must always adjust its interest rates to ensure a stable\nexchange rate and consequently cannot at the same time conduct monetary policy\nto stabilize e.g. domestic inflation or unemployment rates. This makes the\nconduct of stabilization policy fundamentally different from the situation in\nDenmark's neighbouring countries like Norway, Sweden, Poland and the United\nKingdom, in which the central banks have a central stabilizing role. Denmark\nis presently the only OECD member country maintaining an independent currency\nwith a fixed exchange rate. Consequently, the Danish krone is the only\ncurrency in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), before Bulgaria\nand Croatia joined in 2020 (the latter uses the euro since 2023)\n\nIn the first months of 2015, Denmark experienced the largest pressure against\nthe fixed exchange rate for many years because of very large capital inflows,\ncausing a tendency for the Danish krone to appreciate. Danmarks Nationalbank\nreacted in various ways, chiefly by lowering its interest rates to record low\nlevels. On 6 February 2015 the certificates of deposit rate, one of the four\nofficial Danish central bank rates, was lowered to −0.75%. In January 2016 the\nrate was raised to −0.65%, at which level it has been maintained since then.\n\nInflation in Denmark as measured by the official consumer price index of\nStatistics Denmark was 1.1% in 2017. Inflation has generally been low and\nstable for the last decades. Whereas in 1980 annual inflation was more than\n12%, in the period 2000–2017 the average inflation rate was 1.8%."

At the central government level, the Ministry of Finance carries out\nthe coordinating role of conducting economic policy. In 2012, the Danish\nparliament passed a Budget Law (effective from January 2014) which governs the\nover-all fiscal framework, stating among other things that the structural\ndeficit must never exceed 0.5% of GDP, and that Danish fiscal policy is\nrequired to be sustainable, i.e. have a non-negative fiscal sustainability\nindicator. The Budget Law also assigned the role of independent fiscal\ninstitution (IFI, informally known as \"fiscal watchdog\") to the already-\nexisting independent advisory body of the Danish Economic Councils."

In 2022, the official\nDanish tax level amounted to 42.2% of GDP.

The tax structure of Denmark (the relative weight of\ndifferent taxes) also differs from the OECD average, as the Danish tax system\nin 2015 was characterized by substantially higher revenues from taxes on\npersonal income, whereas on the other hand, no revenues at all derive from\nsocial security contributions. A lower proportion of revenues in Denmark\nderive from taxes on corporate income and gains and property taxes than in\nOECD generally, whereas the proportion deriving from payroll taxes, VAT, and\nother taxes on goods and services correspond to the OECD average.\n\nIn 2016, the average marginal tax rate on labour income for all Danish tax-\npayers was 38.9%. The average marginal tax on personal capital income was\n30.7%.\n\nProfessor of Economics at Princeton University Henrik Kleven has suggested\nthat three distinct policies in Denmark and its Scandinavian neighbours imply\nthat the high tax rates cause only relatively small distortions to the\neconomy:\n\n* widespread use of third-party information reporting for tax collection purposes (ensuring a low level of tax evasion)\n* broad tax bases (ensuring a low level of tax avoidance)\n* a strong subsidization of goods that are complementary to working (ensuring a high level of labour force participation).\n\nin 2023, Denmark considered methods to increase taxes on energy dealers."

Not every Danish\ncitizen or employee qualifies for a membership of an unemployment fund, and\nmembership benefits will be terminated after 2 years of unemployment. A person\nthat is not a member of an A-kasse cannot receive unemployment benefits.\nUnemployment funds do not pay benefits to sick members, who will be\ntransferred to a municipal social support system instead. Denmark has a\ncountrywide, but municipally administered social support system against\npoverty, securing that qualified citizens have a minimum living income. All\nDanish citizens above 18 years of age can apply for some financial support if\nthey cannot support themselves or their family. Approval is not automatic, and\nthe extent of this system has generally been diminished since the 1980s. Sick\npeople can receive some financial support throughout the extent of their\nillness. Their ability to work will be re-evaluated by the municipality after\n5 months of illness.\n\nThe welfare system related to the labor market has experienced several reforms\nand financial cuts since the late 1990s due to political agendas for\nincreasing the labor supply. Several reforms of the rights of the unemployed\nhave followed up, partially inspired by the Danish Economic Council. Halving\nthe time unemployment benefits can be received from four to two years, and\nmaking it twice as hard to regain this right, was implemented in 2010 for\nexample.\n\nDisabled people can apply for permanent social pensions. The extent of the\nsupport depends on the ability to work, and people below 40 are not eligible\nunless deemed incapable of any kind of work."

    "text": "Pasture grazing cattle (Rømø)\n\nAgriculture was once the most important industry in Denmark. Nowadays, it is\nof minor economic importance. In 2016, 62,000 people, or 2.5% of all employed\npeople worked in agriculture and horticulture. Another 2,000 people worked in\nfishing. As value added per person is relatively low, the share of national\nvalue added is somewhat lower. Total gross value added in agriculture,\nforestry and fishing amounted to 1.6% of total output in Denmark (in 2017).\nDespite this, Denmark is still home to various types of agricultural\nproduction. Within animal husbandry, it includes dairy and beef cattle, pigs,\npoultry and fur animals – all sectors that produce mainly for export.\nRegarding vegetable production, Denmark is a leading producer of grass-,\nclover- and horticultural seeds. The agriculture and food sector as a whole\nrepresented 25% of total Danish commodity exports in 2015.\n\n63% of the land area of Denmark is used for agricultural production – the\nhighest share in the world according to a report from University of Copenhagen\nin 2017. The Danish agricultural industry is historically characterized by\nfreehold and family ownership, but due to structural development farms have\nbecome fewer and larger. In 2020 the number of farms was approximately 33,000,\nof which approximately 10,000 were owned by full-time farmers."

    "text": "The tendency toward fewer and larger farms has been accompanied by an increase\nin animal production, using fewer resources per produced unit.\n\nThe number of dairy farmers has reduced to about 3,800 with an average herd\nsize of 150 cows. The milk quota is 1,142 tonnes. More than half of the cows\nlive in new loose-housing systems. Export of dairy products accounts for more\nthan 20 percent of the total Danish agricultural export. The total number of\ncattle in 2011 was approximately 1.5 million. Of these, 565,000 were dairy\ncows and 99,000 were suckler cows. The yearly number of slaughtering of beef\ncattle is around 550,000.\n\nFor more than 100 years the production of pigs and pig meat was a major source\nof income in Denmark. Approximately 90 percent of the production is exported.\nThis accounts for almost half of all agricultural exports and for around 5\npercent of Denmark's total exports. About 4,200 farmers produce 28 million\npigs annually. Of these, 20.9 million are slaughtered in Denmark.\n\nFur animal production on an industrial scale started in the 1930s in Denmark.\nPrior to a government-mandated culling during the COVID-19 pandemic, Denmark\nwas the world's largest producer of mink furs, with 1,400 mink farmers\nfostering 17.2 million mink and producing around 14 million furs of the\nhighest quality every year (see mink industry in Denmark). Approximately 98\npercent of the skins sold at Kopenhagen Fur Auction were exported. Fur ranked\nas Danish agriculture's third largest export article, at more than DKK 7\nbillion annually. The number of farms peaked in the late 1980s at more than\n5,000 farms, but the number has declined steadily since, as individual farms\ngrew in size. Danish mink farmers claim their business to be sustainable,\nfeeding the mink food industry waste and using all parts of the dead animal as\nmeat, bone meal and biofuel. Special attention is given to the welfare of the\nmink, and regular \"Open Farm\" arrangements are made for the general public.\nMink thrive in, but are not a native to Denmark, and it is considered an\ninvasive species. American Mink are now widespread in Denmark and continues to\ncause problems for the native wildlife, in particular waterfowl. Denmark also\nhas a small production of fox, chinchilla and rabbit furs.\n\nTwo hundred professional producers are responsible for the Danish egg\nproduction, which was 66 million kg in 2011. Chickens for slaughter are often\nproduced in units with 40,000 broilers. In 2012, 100 million chickens were\nslaughtered. In the minor productions of poultry, 13 million ducks, 1.4\nmillion geese and 5.0 million turkeys were slaughtered in 2012."

    "text": "Denmark has invested heavily in windfarms. In 2015, 42% of the domestic\nelectricity consumption comes from wind. Fossil fuel consumption in Denmark.\n\nDenmark has changed its energy consumption from 99% fossil fuels (92% oil (all\nimported) and 7% coal) and 1% biofuels in 1972 to 73% fossil fuels (37% oil\n(all domestic), 18% coal, 18% natural gas (all domestic)), and 27% renewables\n(largely biofuels) in 2015. The goal is a full independence of fossil fuels by\n2050. This drastic change was initially inspired largely by the discovery of\nDanish oil and gas reserves in the North Sea in 1972 and the 1973 oil crisis.\nThe course took a giant leap forward in 1984, when the Danish North Sea oil\nand gas fields, developed by native industry in close cooperation with the\nstate, started major production. In 1997, Denmark became self-sufficient with\nenergy, and the overall CO2 emission from the energy sector began to fall by\n1996. Wind energy contribution to the total energy consumption has risen from\n1% in 1997 to 5% in 2015.\n\nSince 2000, Denmark has increased gross domestic product (GDP) and at the same\ntime decreased energy consumption. Since 1972, the overall energy consumption\nhas dropped by 6%, even though the GDP has doubled in the same period. Denmark\nhad the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014. Denmark has had\nrelatively high energy taxation to encourage careful use of energy since the\noil crises in the 1970s, and Danish industry has adapted to this and gained a\ncompetitive edge. The so-called \"green taxes\" have been broadly criticised\npartly for being higher than in other countries, but also for being more of a\ntool for gathering government revenue than a method of promoting \"greener\"\nbehaviour.\n\n**2015 overall energy taxes, in billionsDKK** | Oil | Gasoline | Natural gas | Coal | Electricity\n---|---|---|---|---|---\nExcise&VAT | 9.3 | 7.3 | 3.3 | 2.5 | 11.7\n\nDenmark has low electricity costs (including costs for cleaner energy) in EU,\nbut general taxes (11.7 billion DKK in 2015) make the electricity price for\nhouseholds the highest in Europe. As of 2015[update], Denmark has no\nenvironmental tax on electricity.\n\nDenmark is a long-time leader in wind energy and a prominent exporter of\nVestas and Siemens wind turbines, and in 2019 Denmark's exports of wind-\nturbine technology and services amounted to €8.9 billion. It has integrated\nfluctuating and less predictable energy sources such as wind power into the\ngrid. Wind produced the equivalent of 43% of Denmark's total electricity\nconsumption in 2017. The share of total energy production is smaller: In 2015,\nwind accounted for 5% of total Danish energy production.\n\nEnerginet.dk is the Danish national transmission system operator for\nelectricity and natural gas. The electricity grids of western Denmark and\neastern Denmark were not connected until 2010 when the 600MW Great Belt Power\nLink went into operation.\n\nCogeneration plants are the norm in Denmark, usually with district heating\nwhich serves almost 1.9 million households (January 1, 2025), 68% of all\nhouseholds.\n\nWaste-to-energy incinerators produce mostly heating and hot water.\nVestforbrænding in Glostrup Municipality operates Denmark's largest\nincinerator, a cogeneration plant which supplies electricity to 80,000\nhouseholds and heating equivalent to the consumption in 63,000 households\n(2016). Amager Bakke is an example of a new incinerator."
