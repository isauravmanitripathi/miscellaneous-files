    "text": "GDP per capita development in Guinea\n\nGuinea was part of the franc zone countries that included most of the former\nFrench Colonies. After Independence, these countries did not become completely\neconomical free. France decided against monetary autonomy hence they could not\nuse a freely convertible currency. The state intervention of the new\ngovernments was characterized by stops of quotas on imports and internal price\ncontrols. In the time up to c. 1980, the franc-zone countries had on average a\nlower inflation and a higher economic growth compared to the Anglophone\ncounterparts, who could use their own currencies. But regarding the time after\nc. 1980 and the economic liberalism, characterized by Structural Adjustments,\nthe franc zone countries could not outperform the rest.\n\nSince 1985, the Guinean Government has adopted policies to return commercial\nactivity to the private sector, promote investment, reduce the role of the\nstate in the economy, and improve the administrative and judicial framework.\nThe government has eliminated restrictions on agricultural enterprise and\nforeign trade, liquidated many parastatals, increased spending on education,\nand vastly downsized the civil service. The government also has made major\nstrides in restructuring the public finances.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank are heavily involved in the development of Guinea's\neconomy, as are many bilateral donor nations, including the United States.\nGuinea's economic reforms have had recent notable success, improving the rate\nof economic growth to 5% and reducing the rate of inflation to about 99%, as\nwell as increasing government revenues while restraining official\nexpenditures. Although Guinea's external debt burden remains high, the country\nis now current on external debt payments.\n\nCurrent GDP per capita of Guinea shrank by 16% in the 1990s.\n\nThe government revised the private investment code in 1998 to stimulate\neconomic activity in the spirit of a free enterprise. The code does not\ndiscriminate between foreigners and nationals and provides for repatriation of\nprofits. Foreign investments outside Conakry are entitled to especially\nfavorable conditions. A national investment commission has been formed to\nreview all investment proposals. The United States and Guinea have signed an\ninvestment guarantee agreement that offers political risk insurance to\nAmerican investors through OPIC. Guinea plans to inaugurate an arbitration\ncourt system to allow for the quick resolution of commercial disputes.\n\nMean wages were $0.45 per man-hour in 2009.\n\nIn 2002, the IMF suspended Guinea's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility\n(PRGF) because the government failed to meet key performance criteria. In\nreviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending\ngoals in targeted social priority sectors. However, spending in other areas,\nprimarily defense, contributed to a significant fiscal deficit. The loss of\nIMF funds forced the government to finance its debts through central bank\nadvances. The pursuit of unsound economic policies has resulted in imbalances\nthat are proving hard to correct.\n\nUnder then-Prime Minister Diallo, the government began a rigorous reform\nagenda in December 2004 designed to return Guinea to a PRGF with the IMF.\nExchange rates have been allowed to float, price controls on gasoline have\nbeen loosened, and government spending has been reduced while tax collection\nhas been improved. These reforms have not reduced inflation, which hit 27% in\n2004 and 30% in 2005. Currency depreciation is also a concern. The Guinea\nfranc was trading at 2550 to the dollar in January 2005. It hit 5554 to the\ndollar by October 2006. In August 2016 that number had reached 9089.\n\nDespite the opening in 2005 of a new road connecting Guinea and Mali, most\nmajor roadways remain in poor repair, slowing the delivery of goods to local\nmarkets. Electricity and water shortages are frequent and sustained, and many\nbusinesses are forced to use expensive power generators and fuel to stay open.\n\nEven though there are many problems plaguing Guinea's economy, not all foreign\ninvestors are reluctant to come to Guinea. Global Alumina's proposed alumina\nrefinery has a price tag above $2 billion. Alcoa and Alcan are proposing a\nslightly smaller refinery worth about $1.5 billion. Taken together, they\nrepresent the largest private investment in sub-Saharan Africa since the Chad-\nCameroon oil pipeline. Also, Hyperdynamics Corporation, an American oil\ncompany, signed an agreement in 2006 to develop Guinea's offshore Senegal\nBasin oil deposits in a concession of 80,000 square kilometres (31,000 sq mi);\nit is pursuing seismic exploration.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Guinean Mines Minister Mahmoud Thiam announced that the\nChina International Fund would invest more than $7bn (£4.5bn) in\ninfrastructure. In return, he said the firm would be a \"strategic partner\" in\nall mining projects in the mineral-rich nation. He said the firm would help\nbuild ports, railway lines, power plants, low-cost housing and even a new\nadministrative centre in the capital, Conakry. In September 2011, Mohamed\nLamine Fofana, the Mines Minister following the 2010 election, said that the\ngovernment had overturned the agreement by the ex-military junta.\n\nYouth unemployment remains a large problem. Guinea needs an adequate policy to\naddress the concerns of urban youth. One problem is the disparity between\ntheir life and what they see on television. For youth who cannot find jobs,\nseeing the economic power and consumerism of richer countries only serves to\nfrustrate them further."

    "text": "In 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of bauxite.\n\nBauxite mining and alumina production provide about 80% of Guinea's foreign\nexchange. Several U.S. companies are active in this sector. Diamonds and gold\nalso are mined and exported on a large scale, providing additional foreign\nexchange. Concession agreements have been signed for future exploitation of\nGuinea's extensive iron ore deposits.\n\nGuinea is richly endowed with minerals, possessing an estimated one-third of\nthe world's proven reserves of bauxite, more than 1.8 billion metric tons (MT)\n(2.0 billion short tons) of high-grade iron ore, significant diamond and gold\ndeposits, and undetermined quantities of uranium.\n\nLately, with the increase of alumina demand from the booming economy of China,\nthere is a renew interest in Guinea riches. The consortium Alcan and Alcoa,\npartner with the Guinean government in the CBG mining in north western Guinea,\nhave announced the feasibility study for the construction of a 1 million TPa\nalumina smelter. This comes with a similar project from Canadian start-up\nGlobal Alumina trying to come with a 2 billion dollar alumina plant in the\nsame region. As of April 2005, the National Assembly of Guinea has not\nratified Global's project.\n\nRevenue from bauxite mining is expected to fall significantly in 2010 due\nmainly to the world economic situation."

    "text": "Guinea has large reserves of the steel-making raw material, iron ore. Rio\nTinto was the majority owner of the $6 billion Simandou iron ore project,\nwhich it had called the world's best unexploited resource. This project is\nsaid to be of the same magnitude as the Pilbara in Western Australia.\n\nIn 2017, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group pled guilty to a multi-year bribery\nscheme, after an investigation by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)\nled to a trial in the United States and a fine of $412 million. Following\nthis, the SEC also filed a lawsuit in the US against head of Och-Ziff European\noperations, Michael Cohen, for his role in a bribery scheme in the region.\n\nIn 2009 the government of Guinea gave the northern half of Simandou to BSGR\nfor an $165 million investment in the project and a pledge to spend $1 billion\non railways, saying that Rio Tinto wasn't moving into production fast enough.\nThe US Justice Department investigated allegations that BSGR had bribed\nPresident Conté's wife to get him the concession, and so did the Federal\nBureau of Investigation, the next elected President of Guinea, Alpha Condé,\nand an assortment of other national and international entities.\n\nIn April 2014 the Guinean government cancelled the company's mining rights in\nSimandou. BSGR has denied any wrongdoing, and in May 2014 sought arbitration\nover the government of Guinea's decision to expropriate its mining rights. In\nFebruary 2019, BSGR and Guinean President Alpha Condé agreed to drop all\nallegations of wrongdoing as well as the pending arbitration case. Under the\nagreement, BSGR would relinquish rights to Simandou while being allowed to\nmaintain an interest in the smaller Zogota deposit that would be developed by\nNiron Metals head Mick Davis.\n\nIn 2010 Rio Tinto signed a binding agreement with Aluminum Corporation of\nChina Limited to establish a joint venture for the Simandou iron ore project.\nIn November 2016, Rio Tinto admitted paying $10.5 million to a close adviser\nof President Alpha Condé to obtain rights on Simandou. Conde said he knew\nnothing about the bribe and denied any wrongdoing. However, according to\nrecordings obtained by France 24, Guinean authorities were aware of the\nSimandou briberies.\n\nIn July 2017, the UK-based anti-fraud regulator, the Serious Fraud Office\n(SFO) and the Australian Federal Police launched an investigation into Rio\nTinto's business practices in Guinea.\n\nFurther, In November 2016, the former mining minister of Guinea, Mahmoud\nThiam, accused head of Rio Tinto's Guinea operation department of offering him\na bribe in 2010 to regain Rio Tinto's control over half of the undeveloped\nSimandou project.\n\nIn September 2011, Guinea adopted a new mining code. The law set up a\ncommission to review government deals struck during the chaotic days between\nthe end of dictatorship in 2008 and Condé coming to power.\n\nIn September 2015, the French Financial Public Prosecutor's Office launched an\ninvestigation into President Alpha Conde's son, Mohamed Alpha Condé. He was\ncharged with embezzlement of public funds and receiving financial and other\nbenefits from French companies that were interested in the Guinean mining\nindustry.\n\nIn August 2016, son of a former Prime Minister of Gabon, who worked for Och-\nZiff's Africa Management Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S. hedge fund Och-Ziff,\nwas arrested in the US and charged with bribing officials in Guinea, Chad and\nNiger on behalf of the company to secure mining concessions and gain access to\nrelevant confidential information. The investigation also revealed that he was\ninvolved in rewriting Guinea's mining law during President Conde's rule. In\nDecember 2016, the US Department of Justice announced that the man pleaded\nguilty to conspiring to make corrupt payments to government officials in\nAfrica.\n\nAccording to a Global Witness report, Sable Mining sought iron ore\nexplorations rights to Mount Nimba in Guinea by getting close to Conde towards\nthe 2010 elections, backing his campaign for presidency and bribing his son.\nThese allegations have not been verified yet but in March 2016 Guinean\nauthorities ordered an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe Conde government investigated two other contracts as well, one which left\nHyperdynamic with a third of Guinea's offshore lease allocations as well as\nRusal's purchase of the Friguia Aluminum refinery, in which it said that Rusal\ngreatly underpaid."
