    "text": "Nutmeg is one of Grenada's key exports\n\nThe **economy of Grenada** is largely tourism-based, small, and open economy.\nBetween the 1980s and the 2000s, the main thrust of Grenada's economy has\nshifted from agriculture to services, with tourism serving as the leading\nforeign currency earning sector. The country's principal export crops are the\nspices nutmeg and mace (Grenada is the world's second-largest producer of\nnutmeg after Indonesia). Other crops for export include cocoa, citrus fruits,\nbananas, cloves, and cinnamon. Manufacturing industries in Grenada operate\nmostly on a small scale, including production of beverages and other\nfoodstuffs, textiles, and the assembly of electronic components for export.\n\nEconomic growth picked up in the late 1990s following slow growth and domestic\nfiscal adjustment in the early years of the decade. Despite an expansionary\nfiscal policy, the public debt remained moderate at around 50 percent of GDP\nas deficits were financed partly by privatization receipts. Since 2001,\neconomic growth has declined. The decline was caused by adverse shocks, such\nas a slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters. To deal with the\nshocks, fiscal policy became more expansionary, while privatization receipts\ndeclined. As a result, public debt increased sharply to near 110 percent of\nGDP in 2003. Economic conditions worsened when Hurricane Ivan hit the country\nin September 2004; progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded as government\nrevenues fell and policy priorities was shifted to post-hurricane relief.\n\nAlthough reconstruction has proceeded quickly with significant aid from the\ninternational community, tourism and agricultural activities remain weak and\nnearly offset the stimulus from the reconstruction boom. The country is still\nfacing the difficult task of reconstruction and recovery, while public debt is\nunsustainable and the government faces large financing gaps. In the years\nahead, reinvigorating growth will be a high priority, and continued efforts\nare needed to address vulnerabilities.",

    "text": "The economy of Grenada is small, and tourism is its largest foreign exchange\nearner. Grenada shares a common central bank with Organisation of Eastern\nCaribbean States (OECS) and holds East Caribbean dollars as its currency.\nAfter tourism, Grenada relies heavily on agricultural exports, mainly\ndifferent types of spices. Nutmeg, wheat flour, and various fruits make up the\nmajority of Grenada's exports (per 2017). Grenada has suffered many economic\ndrawbacks since becoming a nation. A major concern is the rising fiscal\ndeficit and heavy debt crippling its government operations. Hurricane Ivan in\n2004 led to serious setbacks for Grenada, along with the Great Recession in\n2008 as the United States of America is one of Grenada's largest trade\npartners. Grenada was listed nine spaces above the bottom when it came to\ntotal debt in 126 developing countries in 2017.",

    "text": "After experiencing GDP growth averaging nearly six percent a year in the late\n1990s, economic growth declined considerably after 2001 as a result of a\ndecline in the tourism industry following the September 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks, and damages caused by several hurricanes.\n\nThe economy of Grenada was brought to a near standstill in September 2004 by\nHurricane Ivan, which damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the country's\nbuildings, including some tourist facilities. In July 2005, Hurricane Emily\nstruck Grenada who was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Ivan.\nBesides the negative impacts to the tourism industry, the two devastating\nhurricanes destroyed or significantly damaged a large percentage of Grenada's\ntree crops, which may take years to recover.\n\nAs the damage of Hurricane Ivan to the economy exceeded 200 percent of GDP,\neconomic growth registered a negative growth of three percent in 2004,\ncompared with a positive growth rate of 5.8 percent in 2003. Although signs of\nrecovery have been seen in Grenada after the damage inflicted by Hurricanes\nIvan and Emily, economic conditions remain difficult; GDP is projected at a\ngrowth rate of only one percent for 2005.\n\nWith the absence of sustained growth, the fiscal situation started to\ndeteriorate after 2001, reflecting a continued expansionary policy with a\nsharp increase in spending on social sectors, the wage bill, and goods and\nservices. As a result, the fiscal deficit rose to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2001\nfrom 3.2 percent in 2000. The fiscal situation remained shaky in 2002, with\nthe deficit widening to 19.2 percent of GDP due to dampened output from\nTropical Storm Lili. As the economy began to recover in 2003, the government\nbegan to take steps for fiscal consolidation, and the fiscal deficit fell to\n4.8 percent of GDP. Progress in fiscal consolidation was impeded in 2004 as\nthe government policy changed abruptly to post-hurricane relief. Meanwhile,\ngovernment revenues decreased as a result of the impact of the hurricanes on\nthe economy.\n\nWhile economic growth has declined since 2001 due to adverse shocks, including\na slowdown in the global economy and natural disasters, fiscal policy became\nmore expansionary when privatization receipts declined. As a result, public\ndebt has increased sharply to over 100 percent of GDP since 2002; it remained\nas high as near 130 percent of GDP in 2004.\n\nGrenada is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which\nmanages monetary policy and issues a common currency for all the member\ncountries. Inflation has remained low and stable within the framework of the\ncurrency board arrangement, with inflation averaging at two percent over the\npast 15 years.",
