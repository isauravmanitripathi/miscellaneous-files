The economy\nhas been reliant on mineral extraction since the 1920s, in particular copper.\n\nUpon achieving independence, Zambia had a higher GDP per capita than almost\nall sub-Saharan African countries. Over the subsequent decades, Zambia's\neconomy contracted, in part due to declining copper prices. Since the 2000s,\nZambia's economy has been growing. As of 2019, Zambia's GDP per capita\n(current international dollars) stands at $1,305.00.\n\nZambia is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's most urbanized countries. About one-half\nof the country's 16 million people are concentrated in a few urban zones\nstrung along the major transportation corridors, while rural areas are under-\npopulated.\n\nCopper and cobalt are among Zambia's main exports, while non-traditional\nexports include cotton, coffee, fresh flowers, burley tobacco, gemstones and\nmaize (corn). Zambia is eligible to export duty-free goods to the United\nStates under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); the Act allows\neligible countries from sub-Saharan Africa to export over 6,400 goods to the\nUnited States.\n\nCopper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices\nand the opening of new mines. The maize harvest was again good in 2005,\nhelping boost GDP and agricultural exports. Cooperation continues with\ninternational bodies on programs to reduce poverty, including a new lending\narrangement with the IMF in the second quarter of 2004.",

    "text": "A major switch in the structure of Zambia's economy came with the Mulungushi\nReforms of April 1968: the government declared its intention to acquire equity\nholdings (usually 51% or more) in a number of key foreign-owned firms, to be\ncontrolled by a parastatal conglomerate named the Industrial Development\nCorporation (INDECO). By January 1970, Zambia had acquired majority holding in\nthe Zambian operations of the two major foreign mining corporations, the Anglo\nAmerican Corporation and the Rhodesia Selection Trust (RST); the two became\nthe Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines (NCCM) and Roan Consolidated Mines\n(RCM), respectively. The Zambian government then created a new parastatal\nbody, the Mining Development Corporation (MINDECO). The Finance and\nDevelopment Corporation (FINDECO) allowed the Zambian government to gain\ncontrol of insurance companies and building societies. However, foreign-owned\nbanks (such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays) successfully\nresisted takeover. In 1971, INDECO, MINDECO, and FINDECO were brought together\nunder an omnibus parastatal, the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation\n(ZIMCO), to create one of the largest companies in sub-Saharan Africa, with\nthe country's president, Kenneth Kaunda as chairman of the board. The\nmanagement contracts under which day-to-day operations of the mines had been\ncarried out by Anglo American and RST were ended in 1973. In 1982 NCCM and RCM\nwere merged into the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM).\n\nIn 1973 a massive increase in the price of oil was followed by a slump in\ncopper prices in 1975, resulting in a diminution of export earnings. In 1973\nthe price of copper accounted for 95% of all export earnings; this halved in\nvalue on the world market in 1975. By 1976 Zambia had a balance-of-payments\ncrisis, and rapidly became massively indebted to the International Monetary\nFund (IMF). The Third National Development Plan (1978–83) had to be abandoned\nas crisis management replaced long-term planning.\n\nBy the mid-1980s Zambia was one of the most indebted nations in the world,\nrelative to its gross domestic product (GDP). The IMF was insisting that the\nZambian government should introduce programs aimed at stabilizing the economy\nand restructuring it to reduce dependence on copper. The proposed measures\nincluded: the ending of price controls; devaluation of the kwacha (Zambia's\ncurrency); cut-backs in government expenditure; cancellation of subsidies on\nfood and fertilizer; and increased prices for farm produce. Kaunda's removal\nof food subsidies caused massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs;\nthe country's urbanized population rioted in protest. In desperation, Kaunda\nbroke with the IMF in May 1987 and introduced a New Economic Recovery\nProgramme in 1988. However, this did not help him and he eventually moved\ntoward a new understanding with the IMF in 1989. In 1990 Kaunda was forced to\nmake a major policy volteface: he announced the intention to partially\nprivatize the parastatals. Time, however, was running out for him. Like many\nAfrican independence leaders Kaunda tried to hang on to power but unlike many\nhe called multiparty elections and lost them to the Movement for Multiparty\nDemocracy (MMD) and abided by the results. Kaunda left office with the\ninauguration of MMD leader Frederick Chiluba as president on 2 November 1991.",

    "text": "Zambia's Economic System of Government is Unitary because of that the\nFrederick Chiluba government (1991–2001), which came to power after democratic\nmulti-party elections in November 1991, was committed to extensive economic\nreform.[_page needed_]\n\nZambia's economic transformation into a free market system began toward the\nend of 1991 following a change of government. To tackle a serious economic\ncrisis, the government agreed to introduce substantial economic reforms to\nsecure much-needed loans from the World Bank and IMF.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges was the privatization of the country's copper\nmines, Zambia's prime export earner. The government privatised many state\nindustries, and maintained positive real interest rates. Exchange controls\nwere eliminated and free market principles endorsed. It remains to be seen\nwhether the Mwanawasa government will follow a similar path of implementing\neconomic reform and undertaking further privatization. Zambia has yet to\naddress issues such as reducing the size of the public sector, which still\nrepresents 44% of total formal employment, and improving Zambia's social\nsector delivery systems.\n\nAfter the government privatized the giant parastatal mining company Zambian\nConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), donors resumed balance-of-payment support.\nThe final transfer of ZCCM's assets occurred on March 31, 2000. Although\nbalance-of-payment payments are not the answer to Zambia's long-term debt\nproblems, it will in the short term provide the government some breathing room\nto implement further economic reforms. The government has, however, spent much\nof its foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the exchange rate mechanism.\nTo continue to do so, however, would jeopardize Zambia's debt relief. Zambia\nqualified for HIPC debt relief in 2000, contingent upon the country meeting\ncertain performance criteria, and this should offer a long-term solution to\nZambia's debt situation."

In January\n2003, the Zambian Government informed the International Monetary Fund and\nWorld Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance\ncriteria calling for privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and\nthe national telephone and electricity utilities.\n\nForeign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his anti-corruption drive.\nDuring his presidency, Zambia received foreign investment. The main driver of\neconomic growth was minerals. Mwanawasa's policies helped to lower inflation\nto single digits in 2006, a record the country had not seen in over 25 years,\nand spread some benefits to the poor. Tourists and white farmers diverted from\nZimbabwe and helped the Zambian economy. The policies turned the Zambian town\nof Livingstone, near Victoria Falls, into a tourist hub. Zambia received a\nrelatively large amount of aid and debt relief because of liberalisation and\nMwanawasa's efforts. Overall, economic growth increased to about 6% per year.\n\nAfter Mwanawasa suffered a stroke while attending an African Union summit in\nEgypt on 29 June 2008, Rupiah Banda became acting president and subsequently\nPresident. With divisions within the MMD, Banda promised to \"unite the party\nand the entire nation\" and to \"continue implementing [Mwanawasa's] programs\".\nAfter taking office, however, Banda dismantled much of the anti-corruption\neffort put into place by his predecessor, Mwanawasa. This, compounded with the\neffects of the Great Recession, led to a sustained period of increased\ninflation."

    "text": "In August 2021, the Zambian populace ushered in a new government with a\npromise for jobs growth. Hakainde Hichilema's United Party for National\nDevelopment (UPND) government delivered an ambitious budget that included an\nincrease in the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) from ZMW 1.6 million\n(US$91 thousand) to ZMW 25.7 million (US$1.5 million) for each of Zambia's 156\nconstituencies and its decentralization in release to these constituencies.\nThe expectation is that this will generate jobs growth in addition to the\ngovernment's targeted employment of 30,000 new teachers and 11,200 health\nworkers. In mid July 2022, the government recruited 30,496 Teachers. At the\nend of July 2022, 11,276 health workers, being doctors, nurses and ancillary\nstaff such as drivers were recruited by the government.\n\nWith a push for Zambia to be able to produce 3 million tonnes of Copper per\nannum within the next 10 years, the government reintroduced the deductibility\nof mineral royalty for corporate income tax assessment purposes. The results\nof these policy changes are yet to be seen.\n\nAt the 2022 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings, the World Bank announced it would\nfund projects worth US$560 million in Zambia in 2022.\n\nIn July 2022, to address its debt challenges, the Zambian government engaged\ncreditors of undisbursed loans to facilitate the formal cancellation of loans\nestimated to be about US$2.0 billion. Projects that were already ongoing would\nnow be financed through government revenues.\n\nIn early August 2022, the Zambia Development Agency, a quasi-government\ninstitution under the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry reported that\nit had recorded numerous investment pledges worth US$3.8 billion in the first\nhalf to 2022 targeting the agriculture, tourism, construction and mining\nsectors with a potential job market of 19,000.\n\nIn October 2021, to spur economic development, Zambia took measures to promote\nlocal development in its ambitious 2022 national budget. The Government\nannounced an unprecedented constituency development fund (CDF) increment from\nZMW 1.6 million (U$91,000) to ZMW 25.7 million (U$1.5million) for each\nconstituency taking the total development fund injection into the local\ncommunities from ZMW 250 million (U$14.2 million) to ZMW 4 billion (U$228.4\nmillion). After winning a crucial Staff-Level IMF Deal, in early December\n2021, Zambia went on to cut fuel subsidies later that month as a key step in\nseeking U$1.4 billion from the IMF.\n\nAt the end of July 2022, the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by China\nand France, and vice chaired by South Africa agreed to provide the financing\nassurances under the G20 Common Framework for debt treatment that Zambia had\nbeen waiting for to secure final approval from the International Monetary Fund\nfor a US$1.4 billion bailout under the Extended Credit Facility. In early\nAugust 2022, at the symposium on the midyear budget and economic performance\nand the 2023 to 2025 medium term budget plan, Zambia's Minister of Finance and\nNational Planning, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane said the IMF board was expected\nto meet at the end of August 2022 to approve the loan programme.\n\nOn 31 August 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board approved a\nUS$1.3 billion extended credit facility to help Zambia restore fiscal\nstability.\n\nIn June 2023, Zambia reached an agreement in principle to restructure US$6.3\nbillion of debt with bilateral lenders. In October 2023, Zambia agreed a\nmemorandum of understanding (MoU) with its bilateral creditors on\nrestructuring about $6.3 billion of debt. Following the signing of the MoU,\nthe terms would be implemented through bilateral agreements with each member\nof the OCC (Official Creditor Committee).\n\nIn March 2024, Zambia struck an 76.5 billion kwacha (US$3.0 billion)\nrestructuring deal with bondholders. The agreement included important\nconcessions from the Bondholders, while providing the required debt relief to\nthe Government. Under the agreement, Bondholders would forego approximately\n21.4 billion kwacha (US$840 million) of their claims, and provide cash flow\nrelief of approximately 63.8 billion kwacha (US$2.5 billion) during the IMF\nprogramme period."

    "text": "In 2019, the country was the world's 7th largest producer of copper.\n\nThe Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper-mining industry.\nThe industrialization of the copper industry is owed partly to Frederick\nRussell Burnham, the famous American scout who worked for Cecil Rhodes. By\n1998, however, output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 tonnes,\ncontinuing a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, and until\nrecently, low copper prices and uncertainty over privatization. In 2001, the\nfirst full year of a privatized industry, Zambia recorded its first year of\nincreased productivity since 1973. The future of the copper industry in Zambia\nwas thrown into doubt in January 2002, when investors in Zambia's largest\ncopper mine announced their intention to withdraw their investment. However,\nsurging copper prices from 2004 to the present day rapidly rekindled\ninternational interest in Zambia's copper sector with a new buyer found for\nKCCM and massive investments in expanding capacity launched. China has become\na major investor in the Zambian copper industry, and in February 2007, the two\ncountries announced the creation of a Chinese-Zambian economic partnership\nzone around the Chambishi copper mine.\n\nToday copper mining is central to the economic prospects for Zambia and covers\n85% of all the country's exports, but concerns remain that the economy is not\ndiversified enough to cope with a collapse in international copper prices.\n\nProduction of Mineral Raw Materials 2016-2024  Year  | Copper (MT)  | % Growth of Cu | Cobalt (MT)  | Gold (kg)  | Nickel (MT)  | Manganese (MT)  | Coal(MT)  | Emeralds(kg)  | Beryllium (kg)  | Sulfur (elemental & industrial) (MT)\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n2016  | 774,290  | 8.82%  | 5,276  | 4.610  | 0  | 27,500  | 129,470  | 74,742  | 5,000  | 363,000\n2017  | 799,329  | 3.23%  | 2,649  | 4,373  | 0  | 39,900  | 208,608  | 65,243  | 4,000  | 679,500\n2018  | 861,946  | 7.83%  | 1,766  | 4,044  | 0  | 37,800  | 344,717  | 18,869  | 7,000  | 947,800\n2019  | 796,430  | -7.60%  | 1,271  | 4.522  | 1,110  | 15,904  | 361,648  | 23,705  | 7,000  | 960,300\n2020  | 882,061  | 10.75%  |  367  | 3,994  | 3,226  | 46,515  | 446,153  | 7,653  | 2,000  | 917,300\n2021  | 802,967  | -8.97%  |  247  | 2,432  | 3,834  | 132,241  | 663,345  | 12,871  |  |\n2022  | 763,287  | -4.94%  |  251  | 1,515  | 4,059  | 161,611  | 781,466  | 20,703  |  |\n2023  | 682,431  | -10.59%  |  1,467  |  1,945  | 6,169  | 171,066  | 915,187  | 14,814  |  |\n2024  | 771,036  | 12.98%  | 1,310  | 3.159  | 19,137  |  | 769,531  | 31,683  |  |\n\nIn January 2013, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) approved 27\nmining and exploration licences, with more rumoured to be confirmed.\n\nZambia is the world's second biggest producer of emeralds, with its Kafubu\nRiver area deposits (Kagem Mines) about 45 km (28 mi) southwest of Kitwe\nresponsible for 20% of the world's production of gem-quality stones in 2004.\nIn the first half of 2011, the Kagem Mines produced 3.74 tons of emeralds. In\nApril 2022, Gemfields, the majority owner in the mine, recorded a record\nU$42.3 million at a sold out March/April auction and since 2009, Kagem-sourced\ngemstones (emerald and beryl) have netted Gemfields revenue totaling U$792\nmillion with the proceeds fully repatriated to Kagem in Zambia, with all\nroyalties due to the Zambian government paid on the full sales prices achieved\nat auctions.\n\nKagem Mines Performance  Year  | Premium Emerald (carats)  | Emerald and Beryl ('000 carats)\n---|---|---\n2019  | 204,600  | 36,300\n2020  | 133,900  | 9,400\n2021  | 230,500  | 32,000\n2022  | 259,500  | 37,241\n2023  | 156,700  | 30,153\n\nRich deposits of Uranium have been discovered in some parts of Zambia. In\n2007, the Zambian government sought scrutiny and guidance from the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its developed guidelines to\nregulate the mining of uranium in the country. In 2008, deposits were found in\nKaputa District, Northern Province. Albidon Zambia Limited also confirmed the\npresence of high-grade uranium mineralisation at its Njame east project near\nChirundu. In the Southern Province, 31 km North of Siavonga, and north of Lake\nKariba, there are 5 main Uranium Deposits: Mutanga, Dibwe, Dibwe East, Njame,\nand Gwabe explored under The Mutanga Uranium Project. The Canadian Toronto\nStock Exchange (TSX) listed GoviEx Uranium Inc acquired 100% of the Mutanga\nProject also known as the Kariba Uranium Project in 2016. In March 2022,\nGoviEx announced that the Project is forecast to start production in 2027 and\ncould be the lowest capital intensive uranium project in Africa.\n\nLumwana Mining Company Limited (LMC) who had embarked on uranium exploration\nin 2007 in Solwezi District are currently stock piling uranium that the firm\nis getting as a by-product of Copper from its operations as they are yet to\nobtain a uranium license. The mining of uranium in Zambia is monitored by the\nZambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA).\n\n_See Also:_\n\n* Munali Nickel Mine estimated development cost U$180 million in 2007\n* Enterprise Nickel Project estimated development cost U$275 million"

Over 99% of the Renewable energy\ncomponent was Hydro electricity.\n\nWith a view to diversifying the power generation profile, Zambia increased its\nSolar Power generation Capacity in 2019.\n\nIn March 2019, the 54MW Bangweulu Solar Power Station was commissioned.\n\nIn May 2019, the 34MW Ngonye Solar Power Station was commissioned.\n\nIn July 2022, the local National utility ZESCO, announced it had achieved an\nelectricity generation surplus of about 1,156 MW. Zambia's national generation\ncapacity stands at 3,456.8 MW versus a peak national demand of 2,300 MW. The\nsurplus power is to be directed to service the power supply agreements for the\nexport of 180 MW to Namibia and 100 MW to Zimbabwe. The exportation of 100MW\nelectricity to Zimbabwe which is set to commence in August 2022 is under a\nfive-year contract with a condition precedent that ZESCO earns monthly income\nof US$6.3 million prior exporting to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe close of 2022 brought in some serious challenges to the Zambian economy,\nwhen low water levels at the Kariba Dam significantly impacted the 1080MW\nKariba Hydro Power plant's output capacity and resulted in load shedding for\nbusinesses and residents across the country. This was compounded by the\nmaintenance that was being carried out at the 300MW Maamba Coilleries Coal\nFired Power Plant.\n\nIn January 2023, Zambia signed a US$2 billion dollar MOU and Joint Development\nAgreement (JDA) with the United Arab Emirates for the development of 2000MW of\nSolar Power Projects.\n\nIn April 2023, Zambia, through its state owned utility company ZESCO Limited,\nsigned a ZMW 67 Billion (US$3.4 Billion) Power Purchase Agreement with\nIntegrated Clean Energy Power Company of China to produce 2,400 Mega Watts of\nrenewable energy. Implementation of the project is expected to be done in a\nphased manner with the first phase producing 600MW of solar energy distributed\nas one 300MW power plant in Central Province and another 300MW Power plant in\nSouthern Province. The two 300MW solar power plants of phase one are expected\nto be connected to the National Grid by the end of 2024."

It also helps to\nkeep employments like repairs and alterations in business and forces tailors\nto proceed into more specialize production of styled garments.\n\nThere is a downside to such imports, however; the massive importation of used\nclothing from the developed world has resulted in a near-total collapse of the\nZambian indigenous textile industry. In the face of cheap used clothing,\ntailors' specialized production may be irrelevant - customers will buy the\nleast expensive clothing available, irrespective of style.

    "text": "Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), two countries, that have\nmore than 70% of the world's Cobalt reserves and an abundance of Copper,\nNickel and Manganese have resolved to set up a Zambia-DRC-Executive Battery\nCouncil to oversee the implementation of the cooperating agreement for the\nelectric vehicle battery value chain. The Executive Council's executive\ncommittee will be composed of President Hakainde Hichilema, his DRC\ncounterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the Deputy Secretary General of the African\nEconomic Community for the United Nations, as well as the President of AFREXIM\nBank, as a financial partner. Also issued was a communiqué by the two heads of\nstate that indicated that the two countries will also harmonize policies for\nthe initiative. Zambia and the DRC signed the MOU in Lusaka Zambia on 29 April\n2022.\n\nIn July 2022, the African Export-Import Bank President Benedict Oramah, whilst\nin Lusaka Zambia, announced that a pool of investors had earmarked more than\nUS$500.0 million to set up an industrial park for the purposes of adding value\nto the copper, cobalt, and manganese mined in Zambia. The investors will set\nup plants to process cobalt, copper, and lithium that are in Zambia and\nneighboring countries and establish a US$250 million Battery Electric Vehicle\n(BEV) manufacturing plant.\n\nIn July 2022, at the 94th Agricultural and Commercial Show in Lusaka, the\nmanaging director of the National Utility ZESCO, Victor Mapani announced that\nthe company plans to deploy Electric Vehicle EV charging stations across the\ncountry in an effort to accelerate and promote the transition to EVs and\nenhance carbon emission reduction.\n\nIn December 2022, on the sidelines of the ongoing US-Africa summit in\nWashington DC, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the\nUnited States of America signed an MOU toward the actualization of the\nelectric vehicle battery value chain. Different US institutions and agencies\nsuch as USAID, the US Department of Commerce, the Trade and Development\nAgency, are exploring technical assistance for the Zambia-DRC EV supply chain.\nAdditionally, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Development\nFinance Corporation, will be exploring financing and support mechanisms for\ninvestment in African electric vehicle value chains.\n\nIn April 2023, The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the United\nNations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) signed a framework agreement with\nZambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo for the establishment of special\neconomic zones for the production of electric vehicles and batteries.\nAfreximbank and ECA will lead the establishment of an operating company in\nconsortium with public and private investors and Afreximbank's impact fund\nsubsidiary, the Fund for Export Development in Africa. The new company will\ndevelop special economic zones (SEZs) dedicated to the production of battery\nprecursors, batteries, and electric vehicles, in both nations.\n\nIn October 2023, the Chinese company Better Technology Group announced that\nprocurement of electric vehicle battery, energy storage battery and\nUninterruptiple Supply battery manufacturing equipment was under underway and\nwill be delivered in Zambia by December 2023. This equipment will be part of\nthe EV battery manufacturing facility to be set up in Zambia's Chibomba-\nJiangxi Multi Facility Economic Zone in Central Province with construction set\nto be completed by March 2024. The Group President also announced that the\ncompany has budgeted to invest ZMW 2.18 billion kwacha (US$100 million) in the\nVenture through 2026."

    "text": "GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average =\n100)\n\nLack of balance-of-payment support meant the Zambian government did not have\nresources for capital investment and periodically had to issue bonds or\notherwise expand the money supply to try to meet its spending and debt\nobligations. The government continued these activities even after balance-of-\npayment support resumed. This has kept interest rates at levels that are too\nhigh for local business, fuelled inflation, burdened the budget with domestic\ndebt payments, while still falling short of meeting the public payroll and\nother needs, such as infrastructure rehabilitation. The government was forced\nto draw down foreign exchange reserves sharply in 1998 to meet foreign debt\nobligations, putting further pressure on the kwacha and inflation. Inflation\nheld at 32% in 2000; consequently, the kwacha lost the same value against the\ndollar over the same period. In mid- to late 2001, Zambia's fiscal management\nbecame more conservative. As a result, 2001 year-end inflation was below 20%,\nits best result in decades. In 2002 inflation rose to 26.7%. However, in 2007\ninflation hit 8%, the first time in 30 years that Zambia had seen single digit\ninflation.\n\nOn January 27, 2011, it was reported by the Central Statistical Office that\ninflation rose to 9%. in 2012\n\nBetween April 2019 and April 2020 Zambia' s Annual inflation rate rose to\n15.7% from 14% in March 2020. The rise of prices in food and other non- food\nitems led to the increase in the Annual inflation rate.\n\nHowever, it is significant that inflation often peaks in election years,\nhitting a recent high of 17.9% in 2016. This suggests that a further peak is\nlikely approaching during the 2021 general elections. The value of the kwacha\nagainst the dollar has been relatively consistent for the past two years and\nhas yet to return to the recent high of almost 0.2 kwacha to the dollar in\n2013. Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate of the kwacha against a\nweighted average of foreign currencies improved from 88.5 in 2016 to 96.4 in\n2017. The kwacha lost value against the dollar in September 2018 but has\nremained fairly consistent at 0.08 to the dollar in November to December,\nthough further instability remains likely due to both political and economic\nuncertainty."
