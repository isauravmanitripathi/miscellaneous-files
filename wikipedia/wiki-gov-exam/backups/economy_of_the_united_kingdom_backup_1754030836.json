    "text": "The United Kingdom has a highly developed social market economy. From 2017 to\n2025 it has been the sixth-largest national economy in the world measured by\nnominal gross domestic product (GDP), tenth-largest by purchasing power parity\n(PPP), and about 18th by nominal GDP per capita, constituting 2.4% of world\nGDP and 2.2% by purchasing power parity (PPP).\n\nThe United Kingdom has one of the most globalised economies and comprises\nEngland, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In 2022, the United Kingdom was\nthe fifth-largest exporter of goods and services in the world and the fourth-\nlargest importer. It also had the fourth-largest outward foreign direct\ninvestment, and the fifteenth-largest inward foreign direct investment. In\n2022, the United Kingdom's trade with the European Union accounted for 42% of\nthe country's exports and 48% of its total imports. The United Kingdom has a\nhighly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly\n24.5% of GDP.\n\nThe service sector dominates, contributing 82% of GDP; the financial services\nindustry is particularly important, and London is the second-largest financial\ncentre in the world. Edinburgh was ranked 17th in the world, and 6th in Europe\nfor its financial services industry in 2021. The United Kingdom's technology\nsector is valued at US$1 trillion, third behind the United States and China.\nThe aerospace industry in the United Kingdom is the second-largest national\naerospace industry. Its pharmaceutical industry, the tenth-largest in the\nworld, plays an important role in the economy. Of the world's 500 largest\ncompanies, 17 are headquartered in the UK. The economy is boosted by North Sea\noil and gas production; its reserves were estimated at 2.5 billion barrels in\n2021, although it has been a net importer of oil since 2005. There are\nsignificant regional variations in prosperity, with South East England and\nNorth East Scotland being the richest areas per capita. The size of London's\neconomy makes it the wealthiest city by GDP per capita in Europe. In 2022, the\nUK spent around 2.8% of GDP on research and development.\n\nIn the 18th century, Britain was the first nation to industrialise. During the\n19th century, through its expansive colonial empire and technological\nsuperiority, Britain had a preeminent role in the global economy, accounting\nfor 9.1% of the world's GDP in 1870. The Second Industrial Revolution was also\ntaking place rapidly in the United States and the German Empire; this\npresented an increasing economic challenge for the UK, leading into the 20th\ncentury. The cost of fighting both the First and Second World Wars further\nweakened the UK's relative position. Despite a relative decline in its global\ndominance, in the 21st century the UK retains the ability to project\nsignificant power and influence around the world. During the Great Recession\nof 2008, the UK economy suffered a significant decline, followed by a period\nof weak growth.\n\nGovernment involvement is primarily exercised by His Majesty's Treasury,\nheaded by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Department for Business and\nTrade. Since 1979, management of the economy has followed a broadly laissez-\nfaire approach. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank, and since 1997\nits Monetary Policy Committee has been responsible for setting interest rates,\nquantitative easing, and forward guidance.",

    "text": "The WWII net losses in British national wealth amounted to 18.6% (£4.595\nbillion) of the prewar wealth (£24.68 billion), at 1938 prices. After the\nSecond World War, a new Labour government fully nationalised the Bank of\nEngland, civil aviation, telephone networks, railways, gas, electricity, and\nthe coal, iron and steel industries, affecting 2.3 million workers. Post-war,\nthe United Kingdom enjoyed a long period without a major recession; there was\na rapid growth in prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s, with unemployment staying\nlow and not exceeding 3.5% until the early 1970s. The annual rate of growth\nbetween 1960 and 1973 averaged 2.9%, although this figure was far behind some\nother European countries such as France, West Germany and Italy.\n\nDeindustrialisation meant the closure of operations in mining, heavy industry,\nand manufacturing, resulting in the loss of highly paid working-class jobs.\nThe UK's share of manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830 during the\nIndustrial Revolution to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7%\nby 1938, and 4.9% by 1973. Overseas competition, lack of innovation, trade\nunionism, the welfare state, loss of the British Empire, and cultural\nattitudes have all been put forward as explanations. It reached crisis point\nin the 1970s against the backdrop of a worldwide energy crisis, high\ninflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia.\n\nDuring the 1973 oil crisis (which saw oil prices quadruple), the 1973–74 stock\nmarket crash, and the secondary banking crisis of 1973–75, the British economy\nfell into the 1973–75 recession and the government of Edward Heath was ousted\nby the Labour Party under Harold Wilson, which had previously governed from\n1964 to 1970. Wilson formed a minority government in March 1974 after the\ngeneral election on 28 February ended in a hung parliament. Wilson secured a\nthree-seat overall majority in a second election in October that year. The UK\nrecorded weaker growth than many other European nations in the 1970s; even\nafter the recession, the economy was blighted by rising unemployment and\ndouble-digit inflation, which exceeded 20% more than once and was rarely below\n10% after 1973.\n\nIn 1976, the UK was forced to apply for a loan of £2.3 billion from the\nInternational Monetary Fund. Denis Healey, then Chancellor of the Exchequer,\nwas required to implement public spending cuts and other economic reforms in\norder to secure the loan, and for a while the British economy improved, with\ngrowth of 4.3% in early 1979. Following the discovery of large North Sea oil\nreserves, the UK became a net exporter of oil by the end of the 1970s, which\ncontributed to a massive appreciation of the pound, making exports in general\nmore expensive and imports cheaper. Oil prices doubled between 1979 and 1980,\nfurther reducing manufacturing profitability. After the Winter of Discontent,\nwhen the UK was hit by numerous public sector strikes, the government of James\nCallaghan lost a vote of no confidence in March 1979. This triggered the\ngeneral election on 3 May 1979 which resulted in Margaret Thatcher's\nConservative Party forming a new government. In retrospect, the 1970s is\nconsidered to have been a \"lost decade\" for Britain economically (as well as\nculturally).",

    "text": "A new period of neo-liberal economics began with this election. During the\n1980s, many state-owned industries and utilities were privatised, taxes cut,\ntrade union reforms passed and markets deregulated. GDP fell by 5.9%\ninitially, but growth subsequently returned and rose to an annual rate of 5%\nat its peak in 1988, one of the highest rates of any country in Europe.\n\nThatcher's modernisation of the economy was far from trouble-free; her battle\nwith inflation, which in 1980 had risen to 21.9%, resulted in a substantial\nincrease in unemployment from 5.3% in 1979 to over 10.4% by the start of 1982,\npeaking at nearly 11.9% in 1984 – a level not seen in Britain since the Great\nDepression. The rise in unemployment coincided with the early 1980s global\nrecession, after which UK GDP did not reach its pre-recession rate until 1983.\nIn spite of this, Thatcher was re-elected in June 1983 with a landslide\nmajority. Inflation had fallen to 3.7%, while interest rates were relatively\nhigh at 9.56%. The increase in unemployment was largely due to the\ngovernment's economic policy which resulted in the closure of outdated\nfactories and coal pits. Manufacturing in England and Wales declined from\naround 38% of jobs in 1961 to around 22% in 1981. This trend continued for\nmost of the 1980s, with newer industries and the service sector enjoying\nsignificant growth. Many jobs were also lost as manufacturing became more\nefficient and fewer people were required to work in the sector. Unemployment\nhad fallen below 3 million by the time of Thatcher's third successive election\nvictory in June 1987; and by the end of 1989 it was down to 1.6 million.\n\nBritain's economy slid into another global recession in late 1990; it shrank\nby a total of 6% from peak to trough, and unemployment increased from around\n6.9% in spring 1990 to nearly 10.7% by the end of 1993. However, inflation\ndropped from 10.9% in 1990 to 1.3% three years later. The subsequent economic\nrecovery was extremely strong, and unlike after the early 1980s recession, the\nrecovery saw a rapid and substantial fall in unemployment, which was down to\n7.2% by 1997, although the popularity of the Conservative government had\nfailed to improve with the economic upturn. The government won a fourth\nsuccessive election in 1992 under John Major, who had succeeded Thatcher in\nNovember 1990, but soon afterwards came Black Wednesday, which damaged the\nConservative government's reputation for economic competence, and from that\nstage onwards, the Labour Party was ascendant in the opinion polls,\nparticularly in the immediate aftermath of Tony Blair's election as party\nleader in July 1994 after the sudden death of his predecessor John Smith.\n\nDespite two recessions, wages grew consistently by around 2% per year in real\nterms from 1980 until 1997, and continued to grow until 2008.",

    "text": "In May 1997, Labour, led by Tony Blair, won the general election after 18\nyears of Conservative government. The Labour Government inherited a strong\neconomy with low inflation, falling unemployment, and a current account\nsurplus. Blair ran on a platform of New Labour which was characterised largely\nby the continuation of neo-liberal economic policies, but also supporting a\nstrong welfare state. In Britain it was largely viewed as a combination of\nsocialist and capitalist policies, being dubbed 'Third Way'. Four days after\nthe election, Gordon Brown, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave the Bank\nof England the freedom to control monetary policy, which until then had been\ndirected by the government.\n\nDuring Blair's 10 years in office there were 40 successive quarters of\neconomic growth, lasting until the second quarter of 2008. GDP growth, which\nhad briefly reached 4% per year in the early 1990s, gently declining\nthereafter, was relatively anaemic compared to prior decades, such as the 6.5%\nper year peak in the early 1970s, although growth was smoother and more\nconsistent. Annual growth rates averaged 2.68% between 1992 and 2007, with the\nfinance sector accounting for a greater part than previously. The period saw\none of the highest GDP growth rates of any developed economy and the strongest\nof any European nation. At the same time, household debt rose from £420\nbillion in 1994 to £1 trillion in 2004 and £1.46 trillion in 2008 – more than\nthe entire GDP of the UK.\n\nThis extended period of growth ended in Q2 of 2008 when the United Kingdom\nentered the Great Recession brought about by the 2008 financial crisis. The UK\nwas particularly vulnerable to the crisis because its financial sector was the\nmost highly leveraged of any major economy. Beginning with the collapse of\nNorthern Rock, which was taken into public ownership in February 2008, other\nbanks had to be partly nationalised. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, at its\npeak the fifth-largest bank in the world by market capitalisation, was\neffectively nationalised in October 2008. By mid-2009, HM Treasury had a\n70.33% controlling shareholding in RBS, and a 43% shareholding, through the UK\nFinancial Investments Limited, in Lloyds Banking Group. The Great Recession,\nas it came to be known, saw unemployment rise from just over 1.6 million in\nJanuary 2008 to nearly 2.5 million by October 2009.\n\nIn August 2008 the IMF warned that the country's outlook had worsened due to a\ntwin shock: financial turmoil and rising commodity prices. Both developments\nharmed the UK more than most developed countries, as it obtained revenue from\nexporting financial services while running deficits in goods and commodities,\nincluding food. In 2007, the UK had the world's third largest current account\ndeficit, due mainly to a large deficit in manufactured goods. In May 2008, the\nIMF advised the UK government to broaden the scope of fiscal policy to promote\nexternal balance. The UK's output per hour worked was on a par with the\naverage for the \"old\" EU-15 countries.",

    "text": "In March 2009, the Bank of England (BoE) cut interest rates to a then-historic\nlow of 0.5% and began quantitative easing (QE) to boost lending and shore up\nthe economy. The UK exited the Great Recession in Q4 of 2009 having\nexperienced six consecutive quarters of negative growth, shrinking by 6.03%\nfrom peak to trough, making it the longest recession since records began and\nthe deepest since World War II. Support for Labour slumped during the\nrecession, and the general election of 2010 resulted in a coalition government\nbeing formed by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn 2011, household, financial, and business debts stood at 420% of GDP in the\nUK. As the world's most indebted country, spending and investment were held\nback after the recession, creating economic malaise. However, it was\nrecognised that government borrowing, which rose from 52% to 76% of GDP, had\nhelped to avoid a 1930s-style depression. Within three years of the general\nelection, government cuts aimed at reducing the budget deficit had led to\npublic sector job losses well into six figures, but the private sector enjoyed\nstrong jobs growth.\n\nThe ten years following the Great Recession were characterised by extremes. In\n2015, employment was at its highest since records began, and GDP growth had\nbecome the fastest in the Group of Seven (G7) and Europe, but workforce\nproductivity was the worst since the 1820s, with any growth attributed to a\nfall in working hours. Output per hour worked was 18% below the average for\nthe rest of the G7. Real wage growth was the worst since the 1860s, and the\nGovernor of the Bank of England described it as a lost decade. Wages fell by\n10% in real terms in the eight years to 2016, whilst they grew across the OECD\nby an average of 6.7%. For 2015 as a whole, the current account deficit rose\nto a record high of 5.2% of GDP (£96.2bn), the highest in the developed world.\nIn Q4 2015, it exceeded 7%, a level not witnessed during peacetime since\nrecords began in 1772. The UK relied on foreign investors to plug the\nshortfall in its balance of payments. Homes had become less affordable, a\nproblem exacerbated by QE, without which house prices would have fallen by\n22%, according to the BoE's own analysis.\n\nA rise in unsecured household debt added to questions over the sustainability\nof the economic recovery in 2016. The BoE insisted there was no cause for\nalarm, despite having said two years earlier that the recovery was \"neither\nbalanced nor sustainable\". Following the UK's 2016 decision to leave the\nEuropean Union, the BoE cut interest rates to a new historic low of 0.25% for\njust over a year. It also increased the amount of QE since the start of the\nGreat Recession to £435bn. By Q4 2018 net borrowing in the UK was the highest\nin the OECD at 5% of GDP. Households had been in deficit for an unprecedented\nnine quarters in a row. Since the Great Recession, the country was no longer\nmaking a profit on its foreign investments. The Great Recession had a long\nterm effect on UK's growth; GDP growth slowed from an annual average of 3.0%\nbetween 1993 and 2007 to 1.5% between 2009 and 2023, while labour productivity\ngrowth slowed from an annual average of 1.9% between 1993 and 2008 to 0.4%\nbetween 2008 and 2023. As of early 2024, average wages in the UK adjusted by\ninflation are roughly the same as in 2008.",

The government of\nformer Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a referendum to decide on\nmembership should \"five economic tests\" be met. Until relatively recently\nthere had been debate over whether or not the UK should abolish its currency\nand adopt the euro. In 2007 the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, pledged to hold\na public referendum based on certain tests he set as Chancellor of the\nExchequer. When assessing the tests, Brown concluded that while the decision\nwas close, the United Kingdom should not yet join the euro. He ruled out\nmembership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join\nhad been right for the UK and for Europe. In particular, he cited fluctuations\nin house prices as a barrier to immediate entry.

This gave it a 19.31% market share in Europe.\nIn contrast, the UK was second in Europe for outward FDI, with $42.59bn,\ngiving a 17.24% share of the European market.\n\nIn October 2017, the ONS revised the UK's balance of payments, changing the\nnet international investment position from a surplus of £469bn to a deficit of\n£22bn. Deeper analysis of outward investment revealed that much of what was\nthought to be foreign debt securities owned by British companies were actually\nloans to British citizens. Inward investment also dropped, from a surplus of\n£120bn in the first half of 2016 to a deficit of £25bn in the same period of\n2017. The UK had been relying on a surplus of inward investment to make up for\nits long-term current account deficit. In April 2021, Lord Grimstone\nestablished the UK Investment Council to enhance UK inward investment and\ninform the trade policy of the UK by providing a forum for global investors to\noffer high-level advice to the government.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the UK is the biggest\ninvestor in America, and the second biggest in China."

Poverty is countered in United Kingdom with the welfare state.\n\nThe poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median\nhousehold income. In 2007–2008, this was calculated to be £115 per week for\nsingle adults with no dependent children; £199 per week for couples with no\ndependent children; £195 per week for single adults with two dependent\nchildren under 14; and £279 per week for couples with two dependent children\nunder 14. In 2007–2008, 13.5 million people, or 22% of the population, lived\nbelow this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four\nEU members. In the same year, 4.0 million children, 31% of the total, lived in\nhouseholds below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into\naccount.

    "text": "According to the Government, the number of households in flood risk will be up\nto 970,000 homes in the 2020s, up from around 370,000 in January 2012. The\neffects of flooding and managing flood risk cost the country about £2.2bn a\nyear, compared with the less than £1bn spent on flood protection and\nmanagement. UK agriculture is also being affected by drought and weather\nchanges.\n\nIn 2020 PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that Storm Dennis damage to homes,\nbusinesses and cars could be between £175m and £225m and Storm Ciara cost up\nto £200m. Friends of the Earth criticised British government of the intended\ncuts to flood defence spending. The protection against increasing flood risk\nas a result of climate change requires rising investment. In 2009, the\nEnvironment Agency calculated that the UK needs to be spending £20m more\ncompared to 2010 to 2011 as the baseline, each and every year out to 2035,\njust to keep pace with climate change.\n\nThe British government and the economist Nicholas Stern published the Stern\nReview on the Economics of Climate Change in 2006. The report states that\nclimate change is the greatest and widest-ranging market failure ever seen,\npresenting a unique challenge for economics. The Review provides prescriptions\nincluding environmental taxes to minimise economic and social disruptions. The\nStern Review's main conclusion is that the benefits of strong, early action on\nclimate change far outweigh the costs of not acting. The Review points to the\npotential effects of climate change on water resources, food production,\nhealth, and the environment. According to the Review, without action, the\noverall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% of\nglobal gross domestic product (GDP) each year, now and forever. Including a\nwider range of risks and costs could increase this to 20% of GDP or more. The\nreview leads to a simple conclusion: the benefits of strong, early action\nconsiderably outweigh the costs.\n\nClimate change made the unusual rainfall in autumn and winter 2023-2024, 10\ntimes more probable and 20% stronger. The rainfall led to \"severe damage to\nhomes and infrastructure, power blackouts, travel cancellations, and heavy\nlosses of crops and livestock\". The damage to arable crops alone is £1.2\nbillion, without counting vegetables. Claims for house insurance from weather\nrelated disasters increased by more than a third."
