Prudent\neconomic and fiscal planning has resulted in moderate but sustained growth for\nover a decade. Tunisia's economic growth historically has depended on oil,\nphosphates, agri-food products, car parts manufacturing, and tourism. In the\nWorld Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report for 2015–2016, Tunisia\nranks in 92nd place.\n\nThe year 2015 was marked by terrorist attacks in Tunisia which are likely to\naffect economic growth, especially in tourism, one of the main sectors.",

    "text": "GDP per capita soared by more than 380% in the seventies (1970–1980: USD\n280–1,369). But this proved unsustainable and it collapsed to a cumulative 10%\ngrowth in the turbulent eighties (1980–1990: USD 1,369–1,507), rising again to\nalmost 50% cumulative growth in the nineties (1990–2000: USD 1,507–2,245),\nsignifying the impact of successful diversification.\n\nOlive grove in Sfax, Tunisia\n\nGrowing foreign debt and the foreign exchange crisis in the mid-1980s led the\ngovernment to launch a structural adjustment program to liberalize prices,\nreduce tariffs, and reorient Tunisia toward a market economy in 1986.\nTunisia's economic reform program was lauded as a model by international\nfinancial institutions. The government liberalized prices, reduced tariffs,\nlowered debt-service-to-exports and debt-to-GDP ratios, and extended the\naverage maturity of its $10 billion foreign debt. Structural adjustment\nbrought additional lending from the World Bank and other Western creditors. In\n1990, Tunisia acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and\nis a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nIn 1996 Tunisia entered into an \"Association Agreement\" with the European\nUnion (EU) which removed tariffs and other trade barriers on most goods by\n2008. In conjunction with the Association Agreement, the EU is assisting the\nTunisian government's _Mise A Niveau_ (upgrading) program to enhance the\nproductivity of Tunisian businesses and prepare for competition in the global\nmarketplace.\n\nThe government totally or partially privatized around 160 state-owned\nenterprises after the privatization program was launched in 1987. Although the\nprogram is supported by the GATT, the government had to move carefully to\navoid mass firings. Unemployment continued to plague Tunisia's economy and was\naggravated by a rapidly growing workforce. An estimated 55% of the population\nis under the age of 25. Officially, 15.2% of the Tunisian workforce is\nunemployed.\n\nIn 2011, after the Arab Spring, the economy slumped but then recovered with\n2.81% GDP growth in 2014. However, unemployment is still one of the major\nissues with 15.2% of the labor force unemployed as of the first quarter of\n2014. Tunisia's political transition gained new momentum in early 2014, with\nthe resolution of a political deadlock, the adoption of a new Constitution and\nthe appointment of a new government. The national dialogue platform, brokered\nby key civil society organizations, played a crucial role in gathering all\nmajor political parties. This consensus will allow for further reform in the\neconomy and public sector.\n\nIn 2015, the Bardo National Museum attack led to the collapse of the third\nlargest sector of Tunisia's economy; tourism. Tunisian tourist workers in\nTunis have said that \"tourism is dead, it is completely dead\", expressing the\nsevere drop in tourism after the attack.\n\nThe number of ragpickers in Tunisia is increasing due to the continuing high\nlevel of unemployment, the loss of purchasing power of the most disadvantaged\nfamilies, and the explosion of plastic waste due to new consumption habits.\nRagpickers do not benefit from social protection, granted to professions with\na legal status and may be subject to the exploitation of the Recycling\nindustry.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017.

    "text": "Tunisian exports in 2006\n\nIn 1992, Tunisia re-entered the private international capital market for the\nfirst time in 6 years, securing a $10-million line of credit for balance-of-\npayments support. In January 2003 Standard & Poor's affirmed its investment\ngrade credit ratings for Tunisia. The World Economic Forum 2002-03 ranked\nTunisia 34th in the Global Competitiveness Index Ratings (two places behind\nSouth Africa, the continent's leader). In April 2002, Tunisia's first US\ndollar-denominated sovereign bond issue since 1997 raised $458 million, with\nmaturity in 2012.\n\nThe Bourse de Tunis is under the control of the state-run Financial Market\nCouncil and lists over 50 companies. The government offers substantial tax\nincentives to encourage companies to join the exchange, and expansion is\noccurring.\n\nThe Tunisian government adopted a unified investment code in 1993 to attract\nforeign capital. More than 1,600 export-oriented joint venture firms operate\nin Tunisia to take advantage of relatively low labor costs and preferential\naccess to nearby European markets. Economic links are closest with European\ncountries, which dominate Tunisia's trade. Tunisia's currency, the dinar, is\nnot traded outside Tunisia. However, partial convertibility exists for bona\nfide commercial and investment transaction. Certain restrictions still limit\noperations carried out by Tunisian residents.\n\nThe stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Tunisia was valued at\n$5.3 Billion in 2007, 15% of 2007 GDP, by the World Bank.\n\nFor 2007, foreign direct investment totaled TN Dinar 2 billion in 2007, or\n5.18% of the total volume of investment in the country. This figure is up\n35.7% from 2006 and includes 271 new foreign enterprises and the expansion of\n222 others already based in the country.\n\nThe economic growth rate seen for 2007, at 6.3% is the highest achieved in a\ndecade.\n\nOn 29 and 30 November, Tunisia held an investment conference with country\nchiefs from all around the world with pledges that have reached $30 billion to\nfinance new public projects.\n\nAs of 2022, Tunisia's government is in need of international help as the\neconomy grapples with a crisis in public finances that has raised fears it may\ndefault on debt and has contributed to shortages of food and fuel, according\nto government critics. As a result, the government announced in December 2022\nthat they expect to reduce its fiscal deficit to 5.5% in 2023 from a forecast\n7.7% this year, driven by austerity measures that could pave the way for a\nfinal deal with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. In 2025,\nTunisia severed ties with the IMF.\n\nTunisia's exports to Libya, exceeding 18% growth between 2020 and 2024."
