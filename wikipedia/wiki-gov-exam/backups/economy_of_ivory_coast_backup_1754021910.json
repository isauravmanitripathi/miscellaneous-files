    "text": "The **economy of Ivory Coast** is stable and currently growing, in the\naftermath of political instability in recent decades. The Ivory Coast's\neconomy is largely market-based and depends heavily on the agricultural\nsector. Almost 70% of the Ivorian people are engaged in some form of\nagricultural activity. The economy grew 82% in the 1960s, reaching a peak\ngrowth of 360% in the 1970s, but this proved unsustainable and it shrank by\n28% in the 1980s and a further 22% in the 1990s. This decline, coupled with\nhigh population growth, resulted in a steady fall in living standards. The\ngross national product per capita, now rising again, was about US$727 in 1996.\nIt was substantially higher two decades before. Real GDP growth is expected to\naverage 6.5% in 2024–25.\n\nAfter several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a\ncomeback in 1994, due to the devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices\nfor cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional primary exports such as\npineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil\nand gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling by\nmultilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of franc zone currencies\non 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation rate to 26% in\n1994, but the rate fell sharply from 1996–1999. Moreover, government adherence\nto donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in growth to 5% annually in 1996–99. A\nmajority of the population remains dependent on smallholder cash crop\nproduction.",
