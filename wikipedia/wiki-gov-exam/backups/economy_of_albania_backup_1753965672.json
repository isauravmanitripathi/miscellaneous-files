    "text": "This is a chart of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Albania in US dollars based\non Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) from estimates by the International Monetary\nFund.\n\nYear | GDP (in Bil. US$ PPP) | GDP per capita (in US$ PPP) | GDP (in bil. US$ nominal) | GDP per capita | GDP growth\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n2016 | 34.0 | $11,833 | 11.9 | $4,127 | 3.3%\n2017 | 36.0 | $12,521 | 13.1 | $4,539 | 3.8%\n2018 | 38.4 | $13,345 | 15.2 | $5,289 | 4.2%\n2019 | 40.5 | $14,102 | 16.0 | $5,562 | 3.7%\n2023 | 44.0 | $19,976 | 23.3 | $8,800 | 3.6%\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 49 leks\n(2007 estimate). Mean wages were $300.83 per month in 2009.\n\nAlbania is a low-income country by Western European standards, with a GDP per\ncapita lower than all countries in the EU. According to Eurostat, Albania's\nGDP per capita (expressed in PPS – Purchasing Power Standards) stood at 35% of\nthe EU average in 2008. The unemployment rate in 2018 was 12.4%.\n\nThe results of Albania's efforts were initially encouraging. Led by the\nagricultural sector, real GDP grew by an estimated 111% in 1993, 89% in 1994,\nand more than 119% in 1995, with most of this growth in the private sector.\nAnnual inflation dropped from 25% in 1991 to zero. The Albanian currency, the\nlek, stabilised. Albania became less dependent on food aid. The speed and\nvigour of private entrepreneurial response to Albania's opening and\nliberalising was better than expected. Beginning in 1995, however, progress\nstalled, with negligible GDP growth in 1996 and a 59% contraction in 1997. A\nweakening of government resolve to maintain stabilisation policies in the\nelection year of 1996 contributed to a renewal of inflationary pressures,\nspurred by the budget deficit which exceeded 0.12%. Inflation approached 0.20%\nin 1996 and 0.50% in 1997. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early\n1997 – which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's\npopulation – triggered severe social unrest which led to more than 1,500\ndeaths, widespread destruction of property, and an 0.08% drop in GDP. The lek\ninitially lost up to half of its value during the 1997 crisis, before\nrebounding to its January 1998 level of 0.00143 to the dollar. The new\ngovernment, installed in July 1997, has taken strong measures to restore\npublic order and to revive economic activity and trade.\n\nAlbania is currently undergoing an intensive macroeconomic restructuring\nregime with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The need for\nreform is profound, encompassing all sectors of the economy. In 2000, the\noldest commercial bank, Banka Kombetare Tregtare/BKT was privatised. In 2004,\nthe largest commercial bank in Albania—then the Savings Bank of Albania—was\nprivatised and sold to Raiffeisen Bank of Austria for US$124 million.\nMacroeconomic growth has averaged around 59% over the last five years and\ninflation is low and stable. The government has taken measures to curb violent\ncrime, and recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the\nlarge gray economy and attracting foreign investment.\n\nThe economy is bolstered by annual remittances from abroad representing about\n15% of GDP, mostly from Albanians residing their weekends in Greece and Italy;\nthis helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector, which\naccounts for over half of employment but only about one-fifth of GDP, is\nlimited primarily to small family operations and subsistence farming because\nof a lack of modern equipment, unclear property rights, and the prevalence of\nsmall, inefficient plots of land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on\nhydropower, and antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to\nAlbania's poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new\nforeign investment. The completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has\nhelped diversify generation capacity, and plans to improve transmission lines\nbetween Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy\nshortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to\nimprove the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing barrier to\nsustained economic growth.\n\nReforms have been taken especially since 2005. In 2009, Albania was the only\ncountry in Europe, together with Poland, San Marino, and Liechtenstein, to\nhave economic growth; Albanian GDP real growth was 3.7%. Year after year, the\ntourism sector has gained a growing share in the country's GDP.\n\nData published as of July 2012 by the National Institute of Statistics,\nINSTAT, show the economy contracted by 0.0002% in the first quarter of the\nyear – a downturn blamed mainly on the eurozone debt crisis.\n\nThe informal sector makes up a portion of the economy, although its share\nremains unclear due to its secretive nature.\n\nAccording to Santander Bank, foreign direct investment in Albania now accounts\nfor 50% of its GDP.\n\nBank profitability in Albania has dropped significantly in the last six months\nof 2023. Most international banking groups reported lower return on assets\n(RoA) and return on equity (RoE) for Albanian operations compared to overall\ngroup operations. In the first half of the year, 100% of banks mentioned equal\nprofitability compared to group level. One-third of Albania's parent banks are\nconsidering deleveraging, but all intend to maintain or increase their level\nof activity through subsidiaries.",

Improvements to the road infrastructure, rail,\nurban, and airport transport have all led to a vast improvement in\ntransportation. These upgrades have played a key role in supporting Albania's\neconomy, which in the past decade has come to rely heavily on the construction\nindustry.\n\nAlbania's motorway network has been extensively modernised throughout the\n2000s and part of it is still under construction. There are a total of 3 major\nmotorways in Albania: the A1, A2, and A3.

It has\nseen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the\nearly 1990s. Today, the Airport handles over 5.2 million passengers per year.\nIn April 2021, Kukës Airport became operational in the north, serving first\nflights only to Istanbul and Zurich.
