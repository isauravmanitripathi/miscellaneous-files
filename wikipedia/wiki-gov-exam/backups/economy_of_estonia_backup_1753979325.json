Estonia is a member of the European Union, the eurozone, and the\nOECD. The economy is heavily influenced by developments in the Finnish and\nSwedish economies.\n\nAfter Estonia restored its independence in 1991 and became a market economy,\nit emerged as a pioneer in the global economy. Estonia styled itself as a\nbridge between East and West, adopting significant economic reforms and\ntechnological innovations. In 1992, the country adopted the Estonian kroon as\nits currency, this stabilised the economy. In 1994, it became the first\ncountry in the world to adopt a flat tax, with a rate of 26% regardless of\npersonal income. Estonia received more foreign investment, per person, in the\nlate 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe. The country\nhas been catching-up with the EU-15 \\- the richer European countries. Its GDP\nper capita grew from 35% of the EU-15 average in 1996 to 65% in 2007, similar\nto Central European countries. GDP per capita (current US$) was $30,133 in\n2023 according to the World Bank; this was between the Czech Republic and\nBahrain, but below Saudi Arabia.\n\nFor Estonia, the 2008 financial crisis was easier to weather, because its\nbudget has consistently been kept balanced, and this meant public debt\nrelative to GDP remained the lowest in Europe. The economy recovered in 2010.\nIn January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro, joining the eurozone. Estonia has\ndemonstrated resilience, with a strong service sector, particularly in IT due\nto the Tiigrihüpe project, and advanced e-government services. Estonia's\ncommitment to a circular economy, innovation and its success in maintaining a\nbalanced budget, low public debt, and a competitive tax system have positioned\nit as a model of economic reform and growth in post-Soviet Europe.",

It was issued by\nthe Bank of Estonia, the country's central bank. Compensating the German\nlandowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and\ndivided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian\nprosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly\nGermany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR.\n\nHistorically, Estonia's economy was agricultural, modernising significantly\npost-independence from Russia in 1918. There was a notable knowledge sector in\nTartu and expanding industrial sector, exemplified by the Kreenholm\nManufacturing Company. Western European markets were familiar with Estonian\ndairy, with the main trade partners being Germany and the UK; only 3% of\ncommerce was with the neighbouring USSR. Estonia and Finland had a similar\nstandard of living. USSR's annexation of Estonia in 1940 and destruction\nduring World War II crippled the economy.

    "text": "Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002–2012.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis had a deep effect on the economy, primarily as a\nresult of an investment and consumption slump, that followed the burst of the\nreal estate market bubble that had been building up. In December 2008, Estonia\nbecame a donor country to the IMF-led rescue package for Latvia. In response\nto the crisis, the Ansip government opted for fiscal consolidation and\nretrenchment by maintaining fiscal discipline and a balanced budget in\ncombination with austerity packages: The government increased taxes, and\nreduced public spending by slashing expenditures and public salaries across\nthe board.\n\nAfter a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased.\nIn the first quarter 2008, GDP grew only 0.1%, and then decreased: negative\ngrowth was −1.4% in the 2nd quarter, a little over −3% (on a year-to-year\nbasis) in the 3rd quarter, and −9.4% in the 4th quarter of that year.\n\nThe government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by the\nRiigikogu. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1 billion\nand the expenditure by EEK 3.2 billion. A current account-deficit was extant,\nbut began to shrink in late 2008. In 2009, the economy further contracted by\n15% in the first quarter. Low domestic and foreign demand depressed the\neconomy's overall output. The economy's 34% industrial production drop was the\nsharpest decrease in industrial production in the European Union. Estonia was\none of the five worst-performing economies in the world in terms of annual\ngrowth, and had one of the hightest rates of unemployment in the EU, which\nrose from 4% in May 2008 to 16% in May 2009.\n\nIn July 2009, the value-added tax was increased from 18% to 20%. The recorded\nbudget deficit for 2009 was just 1.7% of GDP. The result was, that Estonia was\none of only five EU countries in 2009 that met the Maastricht criteria for\ndebt and deficit, and had the third-lowest deficit after Luxembourg and\nSweden; Estonia did not ask for support from the IMF. Despite the third-\nlargest drop in GDP, the country had the lowest budget deficit and lowest\npublic debt among Central and Eastern European countries. In 2009, the\nEstonian economy began to rebound, and economic growth resumed in the second\nhalf of 2010. The country's unemployment rate dropped significantly to pre-\nrecession levels. To top it off, Estonia was granted permission in 2010 to\njoin the eurozone in 2011."

Estonia's\njourney towards the euro took longer than originally projected, owing to the\ninflation rate continually being above the required 3% before 2010, which\nprevented the country from fulfilling the entry criteria. The country\noriginally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007 and officially changed\nits target date twice: first to 1 January 2008, and later to 1 January 2011.\n\nOn 12 May 2010, the European Commission announced that Estonia had met all\ncriteria to join the eurozone.

In July\n2010, Estonia received the final approval from ECOFIN to adopt the euro\nonwards from 1 January 2011; on that date Estonia became the 17th eurozone\nmember state and circulated alongside the kroon until 14 January 2011. With\nthat, Estonia became one of the first post-Soviet states to join the eurozone.\n\nIn August 2011, Standard & Poor's raised Estonia's credit rating from A to\nAA-. Among various factors, S&P cited as contributing to its decision was\nconfidence in Estonia's ability to \"sustain strong economic growth.\" Estonia's\nGDP growth rate in 2011 was above 8%, despite having negative population\ngrowth.\n\nThe Estonian economy was hit by the COVID-19 recession before bouncing back\nwith an 8.6% rise in GDP in 2021, this was followed by the economic effect of\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulting in a fall in GDP of\n1.3% in 2022 and high inflation which hit 24% before falling to single digits\nin 2023."

The largest banks are Swedbank, SEB Pank, and\nNordea. Several IPOs have been made recently on the Tallinn Stock Exchange, a\nmember OMX system.\n\nThe Estonian service sector employs over 60% of workforce.

Transit trade's share of GDP is disputed, but many agree that\nRussia's increased hostility is decreasing the share.\n\nInstead of coal, electricity is generated by burning oil shale, with largest\nstations in Narva. Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary\nenergy. Other energy sources are natural gas imported from Russia, wood, motor\nfuels, and fuel oils.\n\nWind power in Estonia amounts to 58.1 megawatts, whilst roughly 399 megawatts\nworth of projects are currently being developed. Estonian energy\nliberalization is lagging far behind the Nordic energy market. During the\naccession negotiations with the EU, Estonia agreed that at least 35% of the\nmarket are opened before 2009 and all of non-household market, which totals\naround 77% of consumption, before 2013. Estonia is concerned that Russia could\nuse energy markets to bully it. In 2009, the government considered granting\npermits to nuclear power companies, and there were plans for a shared nuclear\nfacility with Latvia and Lithuania. Those plans were shelved after the\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011.\n\nEstonia has high Internet penetration, and connections are available\nthroughout most of the country."
