In 2020,\nagriculture only contributed 2.2% to Saint Lucia's GDP, but still accounts for\na significant number of jobs - some 10% of the employed population. As of the\n2010 census, the roughly 10,000 agricultural holdings covered an area of\n30,204 acres, an average of 3.0 acres per agricultural holding.\n\nAbout 18% of the land is used for agricultural practices. Most farms consist\nof less than 5 acres of land. The main agricultural products grown in Saint\nLucia are bananas, coconuts, cocoa beans, mangoes, avocados, vegetables,\ncitrus fruits, and root crops such as yams and sweet potatoes. Most of these\nagricultural products are grown for local consumption, but bananas and\ncoconuts are mainly grown for export, with some vegetables. Bananas occupy\nabout 14,826 acres of the agricultural land, while coconuts occupy 12,400\nacres.\n\nSaint Lucia has a small livestock sector, which is dominated by poultry and\npork. The island is self-sufficient in egg production and is trying to become\nself-sufficient in poultry and pork production. The Ministry of Agriculture is\nencouraging farmers to raise sheep and goats to reduce the island's\nimportation of frozen meats, and has helped by providing support to farmers,\nimporting bloodlines of livestock to increase the productivity of animals, and\nproviding subsidies on animal feed.\n\nHelp is also being given to revitalize the local dairy and beef industries\nthrough the introduction of efficient cattle breeds, training of farmers to\ncare properly for livestock, and establishing funds for the construction of\ndairy units and abattoirs.\n\nThe island is also looking to expand its exports under the Taste of Saint\nLucia brand sponsored by Export Saint Lucia. Products that are being promoted\ninclude Saint Lucia Honey, rum, chocolate, coconut oil, granola, and insect\nrepellent.",

    "text": "St. Lucia's economy depends primarily on revenue from tourism and banana\nproduction, with some contribution from small-scale manufacturing.\n\nAlthough banana revenues have helped fund the country's development since the\n1960s, the industry is now in a terminal decline, due to reduced European\nUnion trade preferences and competition from lower-cost Latin American banana\nproducers. The country is encouraging farmers to plant crops such as cocoa,\nmangoes, and avocados to diversify its agricultural production and provide\njobs for displaced banana workers.\n\nTourism recovered in 2004, following the post-11 September 2001 recession, and\ncontinued to grow in 2005, making up more than 48% of St. Lucia's GDP. The\nhotel and restaurant industry grew by 6.3% during 2005. Stay-over arrivals\nincreased by 6.5%, and the United States remained the most important market,\naccounting for 35.4% of these arrivals. Yacht passengers rose by 21.9%.\nRedeployment of cruise ships, remedial berth construction, and high fuel costs\nprevented higher growth rates. However, several investors have planned new\ntourism projects for the island, including a large hotel and resort in the\nsouthern part of the island. The global recession has caused a reduction in\ntourist revenue and foreign investment, significantly slowing growth rates.\n\nSt. Lucia's currency is the Eastern Caribbean Dollar (EC$), a regional\ncurrency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU).\nThe Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues the EC$, manages monetary\npolicy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its\nmember countries. The ECCB has kept the EC$ pegged at EC$2.7 = US$1.\n\nSt. Lucia is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative and is a\nmember of the Caribbean Community and Common Market. The country hosts the\nexecutive secretariat of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States.\n\nSt. Lucia is the headquarters of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications\nauthority, which is developing the regulations to liberalize the\ntelecommunications sector in the region by 2004."
