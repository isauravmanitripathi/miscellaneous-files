Irrigation water is used mainly for rice while\ncotton is grown as a rainfed crop. (USDA: 2001)\n\nIn 2018, Mali produced:\n\n* 3.8 million tons of maize;\n* 3.1 million tons of rice;\n* 1.8 million tons of millet;\n* 1.5 million tons of sorghum;\n* 814 thousand tons of mango (15th largest producer in the world);\n* 710 thousand tons of cotton (15th largest producer in the world);\n* 551 thousand tons of watermelon;\n* 522 thousand tons of onion;\n* 512 thousand tons of okra;\n* 370 thousand tons of sugar cane;\n* 368 thousand tons of peanuts;\n* 312 thousand tons of sweet potato;\n* 303 thousand tons of potato;\n* 226 thousand tons of sheanut;\n* 215 thousand tons of cowpea;\n* 196 thousand tons of banana;\n* 167 thousand tons of cashew nuts (8th largest producer in the world);\n* 159 thousand tons of beans;\n* 159 thousand tons of tomato;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\n\nAgricultural activities occupy 70% of Mali's labor force and provide 42% of\nthe GDP. Cotton and livestock make up 75%–80% of Mali's annual exports. Small-\nscale traditional farming dominates the agricultural sector, with subsistence\nfarming (of cereals, primarily sorghum, pearl millet, and maize) on about 90%\nof the 14,000 square kilometres (1,400,000 ha; 3,500,000 acres) under\ncultivation.\n\nMan in a Sidibé Agro-techniques greenhouse holding a pepper.\n\nThe most productive agricultural area lies along the banks of the Niger River\nbetween Bamako and Mopti and extends south to the borders of Guinea, Ivory\nCoast, and Burkina Faso. Average rainfall varies in this region from 500 mm\n(20 in) per year around Mopti to 1,400 mm (55 in) in the south near Sikasso.\nThis area is most important for the production of cotton, rice, pearl millet,\nmaize, vegetables, tobacco and tree crops.\n\nAnnual rainfall, critical for Mali's agriculture, has been at or above average\nsince 1993. Cereal production, including rice, has grown annually, and the\n1997–98 cotton harvest reached a record 500,000 tons.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, Mali was self-sufficient in grains — pearl millet,\nsorghum, rice and maize. Diminished harvests during bad years, a growing\npopulation, changing dietary habits, and, most importantly, policy constraints\non agricultural production resulted in grain deficits almost every year from\n1965 to 1986.\n\nProduction has rebounded since 1987 due to agricultural policy reforms\nundertaken by the government and supported by the Western donor nations.\nLiberalization of producer prices and an open cereals market have created\nincentives to production. These reforms, combined with adequate rainfall,\nsuccessful integrated rural agriculture programs in the south, and improved\nmanagement of the Office du Niger, have led to surplus cereal production over\nthe past five years."

The level was gradually restored, but the herds were again decimated\nin the 1983–85 drought. The overall size of Mali's herds is not expected to\nreach pre-drought levels in the north of the country, where encroachment of\nthe desert has forced many nomadic herders to abandon pastoral activities and\nturn instead to farming.\n\nThe largest concentrations of cattle are in the areas north of Bamako and\nSégou extending into the Niger delta, but herding activity is gradually\nshifting southward, due to the effects of previous droughts. Sheep, goats, and\ncamels are raised to the exclusion of cattle in the dry areas north and east\nof Timbuktu."

Gold, the\nlargest source of Malian exports, is still mined in the southern region and at\nthe end of the 20th century Mali had the third highest gold production in\nAfrica (after South Africa and Ghana). These goldfields, the largest of which\nlie in the Bambouk Mountains in western Mali (Kenieba Cercle), were a major\nsource of wealth and trade as far back as the Ghana Empire.\n\nSalt mining in the far north, especially in the Saharan oases of Taoudenni and\nTaghaza have been a crucial part of the Malian economy for at least seven\nhundred years. Both resources were vital components of the Trans-Saharan\ntrade, stretching back to the time of the Roman Empire.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1990s state owned mining—especially for gold—expanded,\nfollowed by a period of expansion by international contract mining.\n\nIn 1991, following the lead of the International Development Association, Mali\nrelaxed the enforcement of mining codes which led to greater foreign\ninvestment in the mining industry. From 1994 to 2007, national and foreign\ncompanies were granted around 150 operating licences along with more than 25\ncertificates for exploitation and more than 200 research permits. Gold mining\nin Mali has increased dramatically, with more than 50 tonnes in 2007 from less\nthan half a tonne produced annually at the end of the 1980s. Mining revenue\ntotaled some 300 billion CFA francs in 2007 more than a thirty times increase\nfrom the 1995 total national mining revenue of less than 10 billion CFA.\nGovernment revenues from mining contracts, less than 1% of the state income in\n1989 were almost 18% in 2007."

Gold has become Mali's largest export, after cotton—historically\nthe basis of Mali's export industry—and livestock. The emergence of gold as\nMali's leading export product since 1999 has helped mitigate some of the\nnegative impacts caused by fluctuations in world cotton markets and loss of\ntrade from the Ivorian Civil War to the south. Large private investments in\ngold mining include Anglogold-Ashanti ($250 million) in Sadiola and Yatela,\nand Randgold Resources ($140 million) in Morila – both multinational South\nAfrican companies located respectively in the north-western and southern parts\nof the country."

Populations complain of displacement for\nthe construction of mines: at Sadiola Gold Mine, 43 villages have lost some\nland to the mine there, while in Fourou, near the large Syama goldmines, 121\nvillages saw some displacement.\n\nIn addition, the continued exploitation of unregulated small scale mining,\noften by child laborers, supplies a large international gold market in Bamako\nwhich feeds into international production. Recent criticism has surfaced\naround the working conditions, pay, and the widespread use of child labor in\nthese small gold mines (as reported recently in the U.S. Department of Labor's\n_List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor_), and the method with\nwhich middlemen, in regional centers like Sikasso and Kayes, purchase and\ntransport gold. Gold collected in the towns is sold on—with almost no\nregulation or oversight—to larger merchant houses in Bamako or Conakry, and\neventually to smelters in Europe.

    "text": "Between 1992 and 1995, Mali implemented an economic adjustment program that\nresulted in economic growth and a reduction in financial imbalances. This was\nreflected in the increased GDP growth rates (9.6% in 2002) and decreased\ninflation. GDP in 2002 amounted to US$3.2 billion, made up of agriculture\n37.8%, industry 26.4% and services 35.9%.\n\nEffective implementation of macroeconomic stabilization and economic\nliberalization policies and the stable political situation resulted in good\neconomic performance and enabled Mali to strengthen the foundations for a\nmarket-oriented economy and encourage private sector development, backed up by\nsignificant progress in implementing the country's privatization program.\nAgricultural reform measures were aimed at diversifying and expanding\nproduction as well as at reducing costs.\n\nMali's economic performance is fragile, characterized by a vulnerability to\nclimatic conditions, fluctuating terms of trade, dependence on ports in\nneighboring countries.\n\nMali produces cotton, cereals and rice. Although locally produced rice now\nprovides competition to imported Asian rice, Mali's primary export is cotton.\nLivestock exports and industry (producing vegetable and cottonseed oils, and\ntextiles) have experienced growth. Although most of Mali is desert or semi-\ndesert, the Niger River is a potential irrigation source. Exports are in three\nprimary sector products (56% gold, 27% cotton, 5% livestock). Ivory Coast is\nwhere most of the country's trade goes through and the crisis previously\nexperienced here had a negative effect on Mali's economy.\n\nThe mining industry in Mali has recently attracted renewed interest and\ninvestment from foreign companies. Gold and phosphate are the only minerals\nmined in Mali although deposits of copper and diamonds do also exist. The\nemergence of gold as Mali's leading export product since 1999 has helped\nmitigate some of the negative impact of the cotton and Ivory Coast crises.\n\nThe development of the oil industry is important due to the country's\ndependence on the importation of all petroleum products from neighbouring\nstates. Electricity is provided by the parastatal utility, Electricite du\nMali."
