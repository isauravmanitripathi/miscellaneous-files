Gabon on paper enjoys a per capita income four times that of most\nnations of Africa, but its reliance on resource extraction industry fail to\nrelease much of the population from extreme poverty, as much of 30% of the\npopulation lives under the poverty threshold (Many Foreign Guest Workers).\nGabon has a free market economy, while other sources claim that Gabon has a\nmixed economic system with a heavy reliance on oil, combined with relatively\nweak centralized economic planning and government regulation.",

      "• The high poverty rate persists despite the country's resource wealth, partly due to the uneven distribution of wealth and economic benefits.",

    "text": "The country is rich in natural resources such as timber, manganese and oil.\nThe country is the fifth largest oil producing nation in Africa, which has\nhelped drive its strong growth in the later 20th century.\n\nThe oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP and 80% of exports. Although there\nhave been recent offshore finds, oil production is now declining from its peak\nof 370,000 barrels per day (59,000 m3/d) in 1997, and periods of low oil\nprices have had a negative impact on government revenues and the economy. In\n2012 there were six active oil rigs in Gabon.\n\nAs of 2023, Gabon produces about 200,000 barrels a day (bpd) of crude oil.\n\nThe government has plans to diversify its economy away from its dwindling oil\nreserves. The government announced in 2012 that it would reassess exactly how\nmuch iron ore the Belinga site contains before awarding the concession to a\nmining company, most likely to be China's CMEC, which temporarily secured the\nrights to the ore in 2007.\n\nAround 80% of Gabonese live in cities. The capital city, Libreville is home to\n59% of the total population. The remainder of the country is still sparsely\npopulated, as those areas remain densely forested."
