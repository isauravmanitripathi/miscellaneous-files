The\nfertile Chernozem soil supports wheat, corn, barley, tobacco, sugar beet, and\nsoybeans. Beef and dairy cattle are raised, and beekeeping is widespread.\nMoldova's best-known product comes from its extensive and well-developed\nvineyards concentrated in the central and southern regions. Moldova produces\nliqueur and sparkling wine. It is also known for its sunflower seeds, walnuts,\napples, and other fruits. This makes the area ideal for agriculture and food\nprocessing, which accounts for about 40% of the country's GDP.\n\nIn 2018, Moldova produced:\n\n* 1.1 million tons of wheat;\n* 132 thousand tons of plum;\n* 174 thousand tons of potato;\n* 175 thousand tons of barley;\n* 2.0 million tons of maize;\n* 665 thousand tons of apple;\n* 707 thousand tons of sugar beet (the beet is used to manufacture sugar and ethanol);\n* 730 thousand tons of grape;\n* 788 thousand tons of sunflower seed.\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like\nrapeseed (85 thousand tons). Moldova has a production of grape and apple\nbetween the 20th and 25th largest in the world, and a production of plum and\nsunflower seed between the 10th and 15th largest of the world.\n\nGDP by sector, 1989, 1999 and 2015\n\nMoldova has experienced economic difficulties, like many other former Soviet\nrepublics. Since its economy was highly dependent on the rest of the former\nSoviet Union for energy and raw materials, the breakdown in trade following\nthe breakup of the Soviet Union had a serious effect, exacerbated at times by\ndrought and civil conflict. The Russian rouble devaluation of 1998 had a\ndeleterious effect on Moldova's economy, but economic growth has been steady\nsince 2000.\n\nMoldova has made progress in economic reform since independence. The\ngovernment has liberalized most prices and has phased out subsidies on most\nbasic consumer goods. A program begun in March 1993 has privatized 80% of all\nhousing units and nearly 2,000 small, medium, and large enterprises, which led\nto a rise in homelessness and unemployment. Other successes include the\nprivatization of nearly all of Moldova's agricultural land from state to\nprivate ownership, as a result of an American assistance program completed in\n2000. A stock market opened in June 1995.\n\nInflation was brought down from over 105% in 1994 to 11% in 1997. Though\ninflation spiked again after Russia’s 1998 currency devaluation, Moldova made\ngreat strides in bringing it under control: 18.4% in 2000, 6.3% in 2001, and\n4.4% in 2002. In 2003 inflation escalated again – due mainly to a drought-\ndriven rise in agricultural prices – reaching 15.7%, although it was reined in\nto 12.5% in 2004. The local currency appreciated considerably in 2003 and the\nfirst months of 2004. By May, the leu had reached its highest level since the\nend of 1999. After the National Bank of Moldova increased considerably its\npurchases on the foreign exchange market, the leu stabilized in\nNovember–December 2004 at 12.00-12.50 to the US dollar.\n\nMoldova continues transitioning towards a free-market economy. The country\nrecorded its fifth consecutive year of positive GDP growth in 2004, with year-\nend real GDP growth of 8%. This growth is impressive considering that, prior\nto 2000, Moldova had recorded only one year of positive GDP growth since\nindependence. Budget execution in 2004 was also impressive, as actual\nconsolidated budget revenues exceeded projections by 1.4% for most of the\nyear.\n\nPrivatization results in 2004 were not significant: several smaller companies\nand one winery were privatized in 2004, but the government postponed\nindefinitely the privatization of several larger state enterprises, including\ntwo electricity distribution companies. Sporadic and ineffective enforcement\nof the law, economic and political uncertainty, and government harassment and\ninterference continue to discourage inflows of foreign direct investment.\n\nImports continued to increase more rapidly than exports during the first nine\nmonths of 2004; Moldova’s terms of trade worsened, as higher-priced energy\nimports outpaced the value of Moldova’s main exports—agricultural and agro-\nprocessing goods.\n\nDuring 2002, Moldova rescheduled an outstanding Eurobond, in the amount of\n$39.6 million, to avoid a potential default. In May 2004, Moldova redeemed\npromissory notes with a total value of $114.5 million to Russian Gazprom for\njust $50 million. Moldova informed its bilateral creditors in mid-2003 that it\nwould no longer service its debts. The 2004 budget did provide funds for\nexternal debt service (interest) at some 6% of the government budget, the 2005\nbudget projects external debt service at some 4%. The International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and World Bank resumed lending to Moldova in July 2002, and then\nsuspended lending again in July 2003. Although Moldova passed a poverty\nreduction strategy in 2004, it has yet to reach an agreement with\ninternational financial institutions.\n\n70% of total electrical energy power consumed in Moldova is imported from\nUkraine and only 30% is produced in Moldova.\n\nIn 2021 Moldova's trade with Russia was $1.33b compared with the EU of $5.06.\nIn 2022 the EU trade increased to $6.9b",

Investment is picking up, and is beginning to replace\nremittances as the main source of growth—an encouraging sign that the earlier\nmodel of consumption-driven growth is changing.\n\nMoldova increasingly faces the challenges experienced by other transition\neconomies. Improved growth prospects have come with strong appreciation\npressures from foreign exchange inflows, and a widening trade deficit. Foreign\ndirect investment (FDI) has picked up and is estimated to have reached 12\npercent of GDP in 2007, compared with 7 percent in 2006.\n\nThe main macroeconomic concern is inflation, which at 13 percent remains high\nfor the region.\n\nA deterioration in the merchandise trade balance due to strong import growth\nhas been offset by improvements in net income and transfers, with a small\nimprovement in the current account deficit to 12 percent of GDP. A resumption\nof wine exports to Russia in October was a major positive development,\nalthough volumes are likely to recover slowly.\n\nFiscal policy remained tight, ending 2007 with a modest deficit of 0.3 percent\nof GDP. Strong revenue performance was driven by robust VAT on imports, while\nexpenditure was kept in line with the budget. However, the tax cuts introduced\nin 2008 may undermine the favorable fiscal position.\n\nMonetary tightening in 2007 was complicated by the strong inflow of foreign\nexchange. The National Bank of Moldova increased reserve requirements from 10\nto 15 percent, and raised policy interest rates by 2.5 percentage points.\nNevertheless, the possibility of second-round effects from the drought,\nliquidity pressures from growing remittances and FDI, and the continued strong\ngrowth in credit and broad money suggest that upside risks to inflation are\nnot yet fully contained.\n\nIn spite of some favorable background, Moldova remains Europe's poorest\nnation, resisting pursuing the types of reforms that have vastly improved the\neconomies of some of its Eastern European neighbors. The Communist Party\nretained political control after winning the March 2005 parliamentary\nelections and re-elected its leader, Vladimir Voronin, as president in\ncollaboration with the opposition. Although the government maintains a pro-\nWestern stance, it has had trouble pursuing structural reforms and has made\nlittle progress on the International Monetary Fund's program to attract\nexternal financial resources. The parliament approved the government's\neconomic growth and strategy paper in December 2004, but international\nfinancial institutions and Western investors will not be satisfied until the\ngovernment begins to address fiscal adjustment, wage restraint, and payment of\ndebt arrears. Despite the fact that the pace of privatization and industrial\noutput has slowed, GDP growth was 7.3 percent in 2004, consumption continues\nto grow, and the currency continues to appreciate. The impasse in the pro-\nRussian Transnistria enclave, plagued by corruption and the smuggling of arms\nand contraband, continues despite international attempts at mediation.",
