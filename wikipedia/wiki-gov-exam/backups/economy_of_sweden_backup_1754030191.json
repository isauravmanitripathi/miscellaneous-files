    "text": "Historical development of real GDP per capita in Sweden\n\nThe **economy of Sweden** is a highly developed export-oriented economy, aided\nby timber, hydropower, and iron ore. These constitute the resource base of an\neconomy oriented toward foreign trade. The main industries include motor\nvehicles, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, industrial machines, precision\nequipment, chemical goods, home goods and appliances, forestry, iron, and\nsteel. Traditionally, Sweden relied on a modern agricultural economy that\nemployed over half the domestic workforce. Today, Sweden further develops\nengineering, mine, steel, and pulp industries, which are competitive\ninternationally, as evidenced by companies such as Ericsson, ASEA/ABB, SKF,\nAlfa Laval, AGA, and Dyno Nobel.\n\nSweden is a competitive open mixed economy. The vast majority of Swedish\nenterprises are privately owned and market-oriented. There is also a strong\nwelfare state, with public-sector spending accounting up to three-fifths of\nGDP. In 2014, the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%.\n\nDue to Sweden being one of the neutral powers during World War II, it did not\nhave to rebuild its economic base, the banking system, and country as a whole,\nas did many other European countries. Sweden has achieved a high standard of\nliving under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare\nbenefits. Sweden has the second highest total tax revenue behind Denmark, as a\nshare of the country's income. As of 2012[update], the total tax revenue was\n44.2% of GDP, down from 48.3% in 2006.\n\nIn 2014 the National Institute of Economic research predicted GDP growth of\n1.8%, 3.1% and 3.4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.[_needs update_] A\ncomparison of upcoming economic growth rates of European Union countries\nrevealed that the Baltic states, Poland, and Slovakia are the only countries\nthat are expected to keep comparable or higher growth rates.",

    "text": "In the 19th century Sweden evolved from a largely agricultural economy into\nthe beginnings of an industrialized, urbanized country. Poverty remained\nwidespread, prompting a large portion of the country to emigrate, mainly to\nthe United States. Economic reforms and the creation of a modern economic\nsystem, banks and corporations were enacted during the later half of the 19th\ncentury. During that time Sweden was in a way the \"powerhouse\" of the\nScandinavian region with a strong industrialization process commencing in the\n1860s. Moreover, the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active\nParliament already during the _Age of Liberty_ (1719–72), and this tradition\ncontinued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition\ntowards modern democracy at the end of said century. Apart from relatively\nhigh levels of human capital formation, the result of the Reformation and\nrelated government policies, such local democratic traditions were the other\nasset that made the \"catching up\" of the Scandinavian countries, including\nSweden, possible and this economic rise was probably the most remarkable\nphenomenon in that region during the nineteenth century.\n\nBy the 1930s, Sweden had what _Life_ magazine called in 1938 the \"world's\nhighest standard of living\". Sweden declared itself neutral during both world\nwars, thereby avoiding much physical destruction and instead, especially after\nthe First World War, profiting from the new circumstances – such as booming\ndemand for raw materials and foodstuffs and the disappearance of international\ncompetition for its exports. The postwar boom, that was the continuation of\nstrong inflationary tendencies during the war itself, propelled Sweden to\ngreater economic prosperity. Beginning in the 1970s and culminating with the\ndeep recession of the early 1990s, Swedish standards of living developed less\nfavorably than many other industrialized countries. Since the mid-1990s, the\neconomic performance has improved.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 2009, Sweden had the world's tenth highest GDP per capita in nominal terms\nand was in 14th place in terms of purchasing power parity.",

    "text": "Sweden has had an economic model in the post-World War II era characterized by\nclose cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The\nSwedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high\ntaxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble\nformed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax\nsystem, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international\neconomic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990\nand 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst\neconomic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published\nin _Computer Sweden_ in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for\ninformation technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and\nbanking sector, the part of the industry that created the crisis. The\ninvestment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992\nthere was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest\nto 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange\nrate. Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.\n\nA real estate boom ended in a bust. The government took over nearly a quarter\nof banking assets at a cost of about 4% of the nation's GDP. This was known\ncolloquially as the \"Stockholm Solution\". In 2007, the United States Federal\nReserve noted, \"In the early 1970s, Sweden had one of the highest income\nlevels in Europe; today, its lead has all but disappeared...So, even well-\nmanaged financial crises don't really have a happy ending\".\n\nThe welfare system that had been growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be\nsustained with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In\n1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. The response of the\ngovernment was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve\nSweden's competitiveness. When the international economic outlook improved\ncombined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well\npositioned to capitalize on, the country was able to emerge from the crisis.\n\nThe crisis of the 1990s was by some viewed as the end of the much buzzed\nwelfare model called \"Svenska modellen\", literally \"The Swedish Model\", as it\nproved that governmental spending at the levels previously experienced in\nSweden was not long-term sustainable in a global open economy. Much of the\nSwedish Model's acclaimed advantages actually had to be viewed as a result of\nthe post WWII special situation, which left Sweden untouched when competitors'\neconomies were comparatively weak.\n\nHowever, the reforms enacted during the 1990s seem to have created a model in\nwhich extensive welfare benefits can be maintained in a global economy.\n\nIn recent years, the Swedish welfare state model has been weakened. Massive\nprivatizations have been carried out since the 1990s, including in public\nservices such as health and education. Inequality has risen sharply, in\nparticular because of a tax system that does not tax wealth and inheritance.",

Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an\neconomy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector\naccounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive\nindustry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance.\nAgriculture accounts for 2 percent of GDP and employment. The armaments\nindustry has a technologically highly advanced reputation.\n\nThe 20 largest Sweden-registered companies by turnover as of 2013[update] were\nVolvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Hennes & Mauritz, Electrolux, Volvo\nPersonvagnar, Preem, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, ICA, Atlas Copco, Nordea, Svenska\nCellulosa Aktiebolaget, Scania, Securitas, Nordstjernan, SKF, ABB Norden\nHolding, and Sony Mobile Communications AB. Sweden's industry is\noverwhelmingly in public and state control, the most prominent example of this\nis LKAB, a state-owned mining company, mostly active in the northern part of\nthe country, with the largest noted market share out of all its domestic\ncompetitors.\n\nSome 4.5 million residents are working, out of which around a third have a\ntertiary education. GDP per hour worked is the world's 9th-highest at US$31 in\n2006, compared to US$22 in Spain and US$35 in United States. According to the\nOECD, deregulation, globalization, and technology-sector growth have been key\ndrivers of productivity. GDP per hour worked is growing 2+1⁄2 per cent a year\nfor the economy as a whole and trade-terms-balanced productivity growth 2%.\nSweden is a world leader in privatized pensions, and pension-funding problems\nare small compared to many other Western European countries. The Swedish labor\nmarket has become more flexible, but it still has some widely acknowledged\nproblems. The typical worker receives only 40% of their income after the tax\nwedge. The slowly declining overall taxation, 51% of GDP in 2007, is still\nnearly double of that in the United States or Ireland. Civil servants amount\nto a third of Swedish workforce, multiple times the proportion in many other\ncountries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s,\nespecially in manufacturing.\n\nWorld Economic Forum 2012–2013 competitiveness index ranks Sweden 4th most\ncompetitive. The Index of Economic Freedom 2012 ranks Sweden the 21st most\nfree out of 179 countries, or 10th out of 43 European countries. Sweden ranked\n9th in the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook 2008, scoring high in private sector\nefficiency. According to the book, _The Flight of the Creative Class_ , by the\nU.S. urban studies, Professor Richard Florida of University of Toronto, Sweden\nis ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is\npredicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers.\nThe book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most\nuseful to business – talent, technology and tolerance. Sweden's investment\ninto research and development stood, in 2007, at over 3.5% of GDP. This is\nconsiderably higher than that of a number of MEDCs, including the United\nStates, and is the largest among the OECD members.\n\nSweden rejected the Euro in a referendum in 2003, and Sweden maintains its own\ncurrency, the Swedish krona (SEK). The Swedish Riksbank – founded in 1668 and\nthus making it the oldest central bank in the world – is currently focusing on\nprice stability with its inflation target of 2%. According to _Economic Survey\nof Sweden 2007_ by OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the\nlowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of\nderegulation and quick utilization of globalization.\n\nThe largest trade flows are with Germany, United States, Norway, United\nKingdom, Denmark and Finland.\n\nThe Swedish economic picture has brightened significantly since the severe\nrecession in the early 1990s. Growth has been strong in recent years, and even\nthough the growth in the economy slackened between 2001 and 2003, the growth\nrate has picked up since with an average growth rate of 3.7% in the last three\nyears. The long-run prospects for growth remain favorable. The inflation rate\nis low and stable, with projections for continued low levels over the next 2–3\nyears.[_needs update_]\n\nSince the mid-1990s the export sector has been booming, acting as the main\nengine for economic growth. Swedish exports also have proven to be\nsurprisingly robust. A marked shift in the structure of the exports, where\nservices, the IT industry, and telecommunications have taken over from\ntraditional industries such as steel, paper and pulp, has made the Swedish\nexport sector less vulnerable to international fluctuations. However, at the\nsame time the Swedish industry has received less money for its exports while\nthe import prices have gone up. During the period 1995–2003 the export prices\nwere reduced by 4% at the same time as the import prices climbed by 11%. The\nnet effect is that the Swedish terms-of-trade fell 13%.\n\nBy 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were warning of a bubble with\nresidential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt\nexpanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF called on\nlegislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater\nsupply of housing as demand was outstripping supply. By August 2014, 40% of\nhome borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying\nprincipal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.\n\n| Parts of this article (those related to Government) need to be **updated**.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available\ninformation. _( June 2016)_\n---|---",

The same\nautumn the government set out its new target: that 80% of the working age\npopulation will have a regular job by 2004. Some have expressed concern that\nmeeting the employment target may come at a cost of too high a rate of wage\nincreases hence increasing inflation. However, as of August 2006, roughly 5%\nof working age Swedes were unemployed, over the government-established goal.\nHowever, some of the people who cannot find work are put away in so-called\n\"labour market political activities\", referred to as \"AMS-åtgärder\".\n\nAccording to Jan Edling, a former trade-unionist, the actual number of\nunemployed is far higher, and those figures are being suppressed by both the\ngovernment and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation.

In 2023, blue-collar\ndensity was 58%, and white-collar density was 73% (full-time students working\npart-time excluded). Just before the considerably raised fees to union\nunemployment funds in January 2007, blue-collar and white-collar union density\nwas the same (77% in 2006). The average union density was 70% in the years\n2011–2014, 69% in 2015-2017 and 68% in 2018 and 2019. There are two major\nconfederations that organise professionals and other qualified employees: the\nSwedish Confederation of Professional Employees (_Tjänstemännens\nCentralorganisation_ or TCO) and the Swedish Confederation of Professional\nAssociations (_Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation_ or SACO). They are\nboth independent from Sweden's political parties and never endorse candidates\nfor office in political elections.\n\nThere is no minimum wage that is required by legislation. Instead, minimum\nwage standards in different sectors are normally set by collective bargaining.\nAbout 90% of all workers are covered by collective agreements, in the private\nsector 83% (2018). The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved\ndespite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to\nwhole industries or sectors. This reflects the dominance of self-regulation\n(regulation by the labour market parties themselves) over state regulation in\nSwedish industrial relations.\n\nSweden has not joined the EMU (the Economic and Monetary Union / the Euro) and\nwill not in the foreseeable future. When the issue was at the agenda, the\nSwedish union movement was very split.

Even so, nominal wages in recent years\nhave been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-\nsector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in\nSweden, the comparable increase for the EU area was 1.75%. In the year 2000\nthe total labour force was around 4.4 million people.",
