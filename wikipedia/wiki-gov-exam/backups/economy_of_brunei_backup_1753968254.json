Part of the\nreserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's\nannual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased,\nand government spending has increased. The government has been running a\nbudget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made\nBrunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.\n\nBrunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price\nincreases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly\nin each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.\n\nThis drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in\nworld markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered\nsomewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In\nrecent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an\nestimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5\nbillion, well below the 1980 peak.\n\nThe Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the\nprice of oil have created uncertainty and instability in Brunei's economy. In\naddition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's\nlargest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy,\ncaused the country to slip into a mild recession.\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at\nmarket prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in\nmillions of Bruneian dollars.\n\nYear | Gross domestic product | US dollar exchange | Inflation index (2000=100)\n---|---|---|---\n1985 | 7,777 | 2.20 Bruneian dollars | 76\n1990 | 6,509 | 1.81 Bruneian dollars | 82\n1995 | 7,394 | 1.41 Bruneian dollars | 95\n2000 | 7,441 | 1.72 Bruneian dollars | 100\n2005 | 10,401 | 1.62 Bruneian dollars | 100\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1.52\nBruneian dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per man-hour in 2009.\n\nThe government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it\nmight disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only\nfor short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions,\nforeigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government\nreported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of\n5.5%.\n\nOil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products\nother than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be\nimported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of\nimports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some\ntransshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and\nMalaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries,\nJapanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction\nequipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was\nthe third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.\n\nBrunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment\nAgency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. BIA's guiding\nprinciple is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while\npursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States,\nJapan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\ncountries.\n\nThe Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New\nenterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting\nprofits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital\ninvested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal\nincome tax or capital gains tax.\n\nOne of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the\ndevelopment of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no\nspecific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation,\nboth shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps\nwhen tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.\n\nCompanies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a\nbranch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of\nCompanies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private\ncompanies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders. At\nleast half of the directors in a company must be residents of Brunei.\n\nBetween 1981 and 2013 the Sultan owned cattle stations in Australia that\nsupplied most of the country's beef. In 1984 it was reported that at 2,262\nsquare miles (5,860 km2), the total area of the stations was larger than\nBrunei itself. Some of the stations were sold in 2006 and 2014. As of 2019,\nthe Sultan still owned the Opium Creek station. Eggs and chickens are largely\nproduced locally, but most of Brunei's other food needs must be imported.\nAgriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government\nhas selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1983–2021 (with IMF\nstaff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.\n\nYear  | GDP (in Bil. US$PPP) | GDP per capita (in US$ PPP) | GDP (in Bil.

    "text": "Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP), a joint venture owned in equal shares by the\nBrunei Government and Shell, is the chief oil and gas production company in\nBrunei. It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister\ncompanies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government.\nBSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of 10,000 barrels per day\n(1,600 m3/d). This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.\n\nThe French oil company Elf Aquitaine became active in petroleum exploration in\nBrunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered\ncommercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells\ndrilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in\nearly 1990. Recently, UNOCAL, partnered with New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge\nhas been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to\ntender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.\n\nBrunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over 240,000 barrels per day (38,000\nm3/d). Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of oil\nreserves and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently\naveraging some 200,000 barrels per day (32,000 m3/d). Japan has traditionally\nbeen the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from\n45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South\nKorea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major\ncustomers include Taiwan (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil\nexports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.\n\nAlmost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at Brunei Liquefied Natural\nGas (LNG) plant, which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in\nthe world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-\nterm agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over\n5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese\ncompany, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei\nGovernment in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which\ntogether produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has\nsupplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well.\nIn 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small\namount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the\nfourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia,\nMalaysia, and Australia.\n\nBrunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient, as of 2015, to last until\nat least 2035. Deep sea exploration may find significant new reserves but can\nbe prohibitively expensive. The government sought in the past decade to\ndiversify the economy with limited success. Oil and gas and government\nspending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-\npetroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.\n\nIn 2015, Brunei registered its third year of economic recession, the only\nASEAN nation to do so. Declining oil prices and a drop in production due to\nmaintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country's\nbudget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016–17.\n\nIn 2020, more than 99% of produced electricity in Brunei was based on fossil\nfuels, while electricity produced from renewable energy accounted for less\nthan 1%. It is advised for Brunei to diversify the economy away from the use\nof fossil fuels and focus more on renewable energy as part of climate change\nmitigation measures.",
