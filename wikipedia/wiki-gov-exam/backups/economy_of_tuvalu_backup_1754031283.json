    "text": "Location of Tuvalu\n\nTuvalu is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway\nbetween Hawaii and Australia, with a population of 11,192 per the 2017 census.\nThe economy of Tuvalu is constrained by its remoteness and lack of economies\nof scale. Government revenues largely come from fishing licences (primarily\npaid under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty); direct grants from international\ndonors (government donors as well as from the Asian Development Bank); and\nincome from the Tuvalu Trust Fund. The lease of its highly fortuitous .tv Top\nLevel Domain (TLD) also contributes revenue. The sale of stamps since the\nindependence of Tuvalu in 1976 has been an important source of revenue for the\ncountry and government. However, such revenue has significantly declined in\nrecent years. Tuvalu has hardly any tourism. It has no tour guides, tour\noperators, or organised activities, and no cruise ships visit.\n\nWorld Bank Statistics outline that in 2010 Tuvalu produced a bottom-tier\nranking Gross Domestic Product of $31,350,804 and Gross National Income of\n$4,760, compared to other Pacific SIDS states such as Kiribati at $2,010 and\nthe Marshall Islands at $3,640. A large proportion of national income comes\nfrom the employment of 15% of adult male Tuvaluans overseas in the maritime\nindustry. The value of these remittances was valued at A$4 million (est. 2006)\nand on average accounts for 10% of GDP. A UN Report makes reference to the\nfact that these revenue streams are vulnerable to macroeconomic change while\nthe national budget remains heavily subsidised through international aid and\nfunding schemes such as the Tuvalu Trust Fund with a strong reliance on the\nimportation of food, which was estimated at $15.5 million in 2007.\n\nThe Tuvalu Trust Fund was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia\nand New Zealand to help supplement national deficits, underpin economic\ndevelopment, and help the nation achieve greater financial autonomy. The Fund\nhas contributed roughly A$79 million, 15% of the annual government budget each\nyear since 1990. With a capital value of about 2.5 times GDP, the Trust Fund\nprovides an important cushion for Tuvalu's volatile income sources from\nfishing and royalties from the sale of the .tv domain. Tuvalu joined the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 June 2010.\n\nOn 5 August 2012, the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nconcluded that a slow recovery was underway in Tuvalu and that GDP grew in\n2011 led by the private retail sector and education spending.\n\nThe increase in inflation in 2022 was due to the rapid rise in the cost of\nfood resulting from a drought that affected food production and from rising\nglobal food prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (food imports\nrepresent 19 percent of Tuvalu’s GDP, while agriculture makes up for only 10\npercent of GDP). The government declared a national state of emergency in\nNovember 2022 as a consequence of a drought that exhausted rainwater supplies.\nThe government responded to the rising inflation through untargeted “inflation\nmitigation payouts” (totalling AUD 400,000 or AUD 40 dollars per eligible\nhousehold) and by expanding a list of products under price controls. In 2023,\nthe IMF Article IV consultation with Tuvalu concluded that a successful\nvaccination strategy allowed Tuvalu to lift coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\ncontainment measures at the end of 2022. However, the economic cost of the\npandemic was significant, with real gross domestic product growth falling from\n13.8% in 2019 to -4.3 percent in 2020, although it recovered to 1.8% in 2021.\nInflation rose to 11.5% in 2022, but inflation is projected to fall to 2.8% by\n2028.\n\nIslands of Tuvalu"

    "text": "Agriculture in Tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large\npits of composted soil below the water table. Subsistence farming of coconut\npalms to produce copra and fishing remain the primary economic activities,\nparticularly off the capital island of Funafuti. There is no apparent large\nincome disparity among the residents, although virtually the only jobs in the\nislands that pay a steady wage or salary are with the government, which make\nup about two-thirds of those in formal employment. About 15% of adult males\nwork as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships. Population growth on the\nouter islands, the limits as to available land and the lack of employment\nopportunities, results in a flow of people from the outer islands to the\ncapital in Funafuti with further pressure to migrate to Australia or New\nZealand. There is high youth unemployment and few new jobs being created.\nGiven the absence of natural resources (apart from tuna in the territorial\nwaters), and the constraints imposed on the Tuvaluan economy by its remoteness\nand lack of economies of scale, practical policies are needed for improvements\nto the livelihoods of the growing numbers of young Tuvaluans who aspire to a\nmore affluent lifestyle than older generations.\n\nTuvalu comprises four reef islands and five true atolls that result in a\n_contiguous zone:_ 24 nmi (44 km) _exclusive economic zone:_ 200 nmi (370 km)\n_territorial sea:_ 12 nmi (22 km). Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru,\nSamoa and Fiji. Tuvalu has worked with Secretariat of the Pacific Community\n(SPC) and the European Union and enacted the Seabed Minerals Act 2014. The\nSPC-EU Pacific Deep Sea Minerals Project involves cooperation between the Cook\nIslands, Fiji, Tonga and Tuvalu with the object of those countries making\ninformed decisions about future deep seabed mineral activities.\n\nThe population is 10,507 (2017 Census), which makes Tuvalu the third-least\npopulous sovereign state in the world; as compared to its immediate\nneighbours, it has a larger population than Nauru, but is smaller than\nKiribati which has a permanent population of just over 100,000 (2011). In\nterms of physical land size, at just 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi) Tuvalu is\nthe fourth smallest country in the world; as compared to its immediate\nneighbours, Tuvalu is larger than Nauru, which is 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi), and\nsmaller than Kiribati, which comprises groups of atolls dispersed over 3.5\nmillion square kilometres, (1,351,000 square miles) of the Pacific Ocean.\nTuvalu's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) covers an oceanic area of approximately\n900,000 km2.\n\nTuvalu is considered a safe country of unspoiled natural beauty and friendly\npeople. However, due to its remoteness, the cost of travelling to the island\nand limited air traffic to the country, limited numbers of tourists visit each\nyear. The majority of visitors to Tuvalu are government officials, aid\nworkers, NGO officials or consultants.",

    "text": "Tuvaluans are primarily involved in traditional agriculture and fishing. Job\nopportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to\nmonitor compliance with the boat's tuna fishing licence.\n\nThe Tuvaluan economy, therefore, relies heavily on its fishing income, with\n42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels.\nThe fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) mainly consists of Skipjack\nTuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna. UN Data calculated a gross value of\nfisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of\ncoastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based\noffshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and\naquaculture. In recent years all of the income has been generated through the\nlisted activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from\nTuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008\ncomprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse\nseiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541\ntonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu\nretains a sizeable share in income via licensing. Fishing licensing agreements\nwith Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United States generated\nan income of A$9 million in 2009. In 2013 revenue from fishing licenses\ndoubled to more than 45% of GDP.\n\nOn 29 June 2017, the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu (NAFICOT), signed\na joint venture agreement with the Republic of Korea's SAJO Fishing Industry\nto operate the fishing vessel _M.V. Taina_ within the Tuvaluan EEZ and other\nPacific Island waters.\n\nThe 2021 Budget of Tuvalu set out a shift in government policy regarding\nengagement in fishing activities, with a shift from joint venture arrangements\n(including the sale of _FV Taumoana_ for $10.4 million) to just receiving\nrevenue from fishing licenses and receiving management fees for flagged ships.",

    "text": "Tuvalu men have for some time been employed abroad, working on container\nships, primarily on German-owned ships. Remittances from seafarers is a major\nsource of income for their families in Tuvalu. In 2002, the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) approved an assistance package to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime\nTraining Institute (TMTI) which trains young Tuvaluans so they can work aboard\nforeign vessels. This project was completed in 2011.\n\nThe Great Recession impacted global export-import activities and the demand\nfor shipping, which reduced the need for Tuvaluan seafarers.\n\nThe 1991 census identified 272 seaman working on merchant ships. In 2002 the\nTuvaluan Overseas Seaman's Union (TOSU) estimated the number as 417 seaman\nworking on ships. In 2011 the ADB estimated there were 800 TMTI graduates\nregistered for employment as seafarers. The ADB identified that the number of\nTuvaluans employed as seafarers has decreased steadily from about 340 in 2001\nto only 205 in 2010; so that of a total pool of 800 qualified seafarers,\nincluding those on leave, almost 450 were unemployed. This decline in seafarer\nemployment has reduced remittances from $2.4 million in 2001 to a projected\n$1.2 million in 2010. The International Labour Organization (ILO) also\nestimates that in 2010 there were approximately 200 Tuvaluan seafarers on\nships. The International Monetary Fund 2014 Country Report described the\neffect of the GFC as reducing demand for the services of Tuvaluan seafarers.\nAs of October 2013, there were about 112 Tuvalu seafarers working on cargo\nships, compared to 361 in 2006. The consequence is that remittances from\nseafarers to their families in Tuvalu fell by about 9% of GDP for Tuvalu. In\n2012 such remittances were 10% of GDP for Tuvalu.\n\nWhile a budget deficit of A$0.4 million was projected for 2015, the ADB\nassessed the budget as being A$14.3m in surplus as the result of high tuna\nfish license fees. The ADB predicted that the 2% growth rate for 2015 would\ncontinue into 2016."

With a\ncapital value of about 3.5 times GDP, the TTF provides an important cushion\nfor Tuvalu's volatile income sources from fishing and royalties from the sale\nof the dot-TV domain.\n\nThe IMF 2014 Country Report noted the market value of the TTF dropped during\nthe Great Recession, however by 2014 the total value of the fund had recovered\nto more than $A140 million (3.5 times GDP). In 2018 the TTF amounted to about\nA$179 million. In 2021 the TTF amounted to about A$192 million. In 2021 the\nmarket value of the TTF rose by 12 percent to its highest level on record (261\npercent of GDP). However, the volatility in global equity markets in 2022\nresulted in the TTF’s value falling to A$191 million.\n\nThe capital of the Trust Fund is known as the “A Account”. The \"B Account\" or\n“Consolidated Investment Fund” (CIF) is a revolving “buffer account” that\nreceives funds from the returns or “disbursements” of the \"A Account\". The\noperation of the Trust Fund through two accounts assists in stabilising the\nlong-term financial situation of the Government of Tuvalu as well as\naddressing short-term budget needs. The \"B Account\", which belongs exclusively\nto the Government, holds income distributions from the \"A Account\" until funds\nare needed to be used for the national budget. It, therefore, serves as a\nbuffer against the volatility of the ‘A Account’ returns, i.e., during years\nwhen there are no returns or low returns. Brian Bell, a member of the Tuvalu\nTrust Fund Advisory Committee from the inception of the Trust Fund in 1987 to\n2002, describes the purpose of the Trust Fund as being:\n\n“The Tuvalu Trust Fund was aimed at providing a source of revenue to overcome a chronic budget deficit situation. The revenue is distributed to the Government from the A Account to the B Account. The amount needed is then drawn down into the consolidated revenue account as an additional source of revenue for expenditure on government services through the recurrent budget.”\n\nThe 20th-anniversary review of the Tuvalu Trust Fund described the performance\nas being that:\n\n“In the first twenty years of operation the Fund has grown to $106.6 million in Market Value as of 30 June 2007. The real rate of return on the Fund has averaged 6.2 percent per annum providing $65.7 million in revenue to Tuvalu. Of this $24.1 million has been used to help fund budget deficits, $29.2 million has been reinvested in the Fund and $12.4 million is held in the CIF awaiting drawdown as of 30 June 2007. The Government's subsequent reinvestments back into the Fund since inception raises Tuvalu's contributions to the Fund to $29.8 million including the initial contribution of $1.6 million. It makes Tuvalu the major contributor to the Fund, which is evidence of Tuvalu's commitment to the long term sustainability of the Fund.”"

    "text": "In 1999 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government of Tuvalu set up\nthe Falekaupule Trust Fund, which is intended to improve services on the outer\nislands. The island councils – composed of traditional leaders – are\nresponsible for managing their own finances from a budget allocated from the\nTuvaluan government from the Falekaupule Trust Fund. Under the Falekaupule\nAct, _Falekaupule_ means “traditional assembly in each island...composed in\naccordance with the Aganu of each island”. _Aganu_ means traditional custom\nand culture. The initial capital of Falekaupule Trust Fund was A$12 million.\nThe market value of the FTF has increased:\n\n“As at 30 June 2007, the FTF's market value stood at $25.3 million. After eight years of operation, the FTF has made three distributions totalling to $4.7 million. A Reserve Account was established in 2005 having the exact same purpose as the CIF, which is to smooth out the stream of revenue from the main investment. At 30 June 2007, the FTF's Reserve Account was $1.4 million.”\n\nThe Great Recession affected the FTF, which is required to maintain its value\nin real terms before a distribution can be made. As of 30 September 2010, the\nmaintained value was $27.3 million; the result of capital growth and\ncontributions from development partners. This is some $3.5 million higher than\nthe market value of $23.8 million. The gap of 15% between the market value and\nthe maintained value must be recouped before another distribution can be made.\nSince the commencement of FTF, there have been four years in which\ndistributions were made. The FTF has distributed $6.4 million with some $5.3\nmillion allocated to island development (the balance of $1.1 million is held\nin reserve by the communities). This equates to an average of $55,000 spent\nper island per year."

Thus,\nas a direct result of the GEC, no distribution was made from the fund to the\nbudget for 2010 and further distributions are unlikely while there is\nuncertainty in international financial markets.”\n\nThe IMF 2010 Country Report describes economic activity in Tuvalu as dampened\nby lower offshore earnings, with “[t]he economy is expected to have almost no\ngrowth in 2010, and growth is projected to be zero or even turn negative in\n2011, led by lower government spending, and remain low over the medium term.”\n\nThe IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth had been volatile\naveraging only 1 percent in the past decade. The 2014 Country Report describes\neconomic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large\nrevenues from fishing licenses, together with substantial foreign aid, \"while,\nover the medium to long run, growth prospects may be hampered by the dominance\nof inefficient public enterprise in the economy, uncertainty in the fisheries\nsector, and weak competitiveness.\"\n\nThe IMF 2021 Country Report concluded that swift implementation of COVID-19\ncontainment measures and COVID-related fiscal spending financed by buoyant\nfishing revenues and donor grants have allowed Tuvalu to avoid a recession in\n2020."

SOPAC ranks the country as extremely vulnerable using the\nEnvironmental Vulnerability Index. Tuvalu's National Adaptation Programme of\nAction (NAPA) describes a response to the climate change problem as using the\ncombined efforts of several local bodies on each island that will work with\nthe local community leaders (the Falekaupule). The main office, named the\nDepartment of Environment, is responsible for coordinating the non-\ngovernmental organizations, religious bodies, and stakeholders. Each of the\nnamed groups are responsible for implementing Tuvalu's NAPA, the main plan to\nadapt to the adverse effects of human use and climate change.\n\nThe establishment of the A$5 million Tuvalu Survival Fund (TSF) in the 2016\nTuvaluan budget was intended for climate change mitigation and the recovery\nexpenses that followed the impact of Cyclone Pam, which impacted Tuvalu in\n2015.\n\nThe Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP) was launched in 2017 for the\npurpose of enhancing the resilience of the islands of Tuvalu to meet the\nchallenges resulting from higher sea levels. Tuvalu was the first country in\nthe Pacific to access climate finance from Green Climate Fund, with the\nsupport of the UNDP. In December 2022, work on the Funafuti reclamation\nproject commenced. The project is to dredge sand from the lagoon to construct\na platform on Fongafale, Funafuti that is 780 meters long and 100 meters wide,\nwhich is designed to remain above sea level rise and the reach of storm waves\nbeyond the year 2100. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade\n(DFAT) also provided funding for the TCAP.
