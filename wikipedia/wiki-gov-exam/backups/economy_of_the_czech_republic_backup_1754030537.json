Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly\navailable information.  \nLast update: 2015 _( January 2025)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of the Czech Republic** is a developed export-oriented social\nmarket economy based in services, manufacturing, and innovation that maintains\na high-income welfare state and the European social model. The Czech Republic\nparticipates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union,\nand is therefore a part of the economy of the European Union. It uses its own\ncurrency, the Czech koruna, instead of the euro. It is a member of the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The Czech\nRepublic ranks 16th in inequality-adjusted human development and 24th in World\nBank Human Capital Index, ahead of countries such as the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom or France. In 2019 it was described by _The Guardian_ as \"one\nof Europe's most flourishing economies\", but in 2023 as \"sick man of Europe\"\nby Die Welt.\n\nThe industry sector accounts for 37% of the economy, while services account\nfor 61% and agriculture for 2%. The principal industries are high tech\nengineering, electronics and machine-building, steel production,\ntransportation equipment (automotive, rail and aerospace industry), chemicals,\nadvanced materials and pharmaceuticals. The major services are research and\ndevelopment, ICT and software development, nanotechnology and life sciences.\nIts main agricultural products are cereals, vegetable oils and hops.\n\nAs of 2023,[update] the Czech GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is\n$50,961 and 698,706 Czech crowns ($31,368) at nominal value. As of September\n2021,[update] the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic was the lowest in\nthe EU at 2.6%, and the poverty rate is the second lowest of OECD members,\nfollowing Denmark. The Czech Republic ranks 21st in the Index of Economic\nFreedom (ranked behind Chile), 30th in the Global Innovation Index (ranked\nbehind UAE), 32nd in the Global Competitiveness Report, 41st in the ease of\ndoing business index and 25th in the Global Enabling Trade Report (ranked\nbehind Canada). The largest trading partner for both export and import is\nGermany, followed by other members of the EU. The Czech Republic has a highly\ndiverse economy that ranks 7th in the 2019 Economic Complexity Index.",

The Czech industrial tradition\ndates back to the 19th century, when the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were the\neconomic and industrial heartland of the Austrian Empire and later the\nAustrian side of Austria-Hungary. The Czech lands produced a majority (about\n70%) of all industrial goods in the Empire, some of which were almost\nmonopolistic.\n\nAfter the First World War, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire collapsed and\nindependent Czechoslovakia was created. Czechoslovakia had way too big\nindustrial production for a small internal market and it missed the big market\nof the former Empire. The Czechoslovak crown was introduced in April 1919 at a\n1:1 ratio to the Austro-Hungarian currency, it became one of the most stable\ncurrencies in Europe.[_citation needed_] It is a widespread myth among Czechs\nthat the First Republic belonged to the 10 most developed economies of the\nworld. In fact it had the 14th highest GDP per capita in the world. The Czech\npart (without Slovakia and Transcarpathia) had a similar GDP in the 1920s to\nGermany and Belgium, which was higher than that of the crisis-struck Austrian\nFirst Republic.\n\nThe consequences of the 1938 Munich Agreement and subsequent Nazi Germany\noccupation were disastrous for the economy. After the occupation and forced\nsubordination of the economy to Nazi German economic interests, the crown was\nofficially pegged to the mark at a ratio of 1:10, even though the unofficial\nexchange rate was 1 to 6-7 and Germans immediately started buying Czech goods\nin large quantities.\n\nAfter the World War II and the Communist Coup d'état were all the economies of\nthe socialist countries tightly linked to that of the Soviet Union, in\naccordance with Stalin's development policy of planned interdependence.\nCzechoslovakia was the most prosperous country in the Eastern Bloc, however it\nwas during the decades overtaken not only by Austria or Finland but also\nSouthern European economies like that of Italy, Spain or Greece.\n\nCzech National Bank headquarters in Prague Heavy industry such as steelmaking\nis a traditional part of the Czech economy.

    "text": "The \"Velvet Revolution\" in 1989, offered a chance for profound and sustained\npolitical and economic reform. With the disintegration of the communist\neconomic alliance in 1991, Czech manufacturers lost their traditional markets\namong former communist countries in the east. Signs of economic resurgence\nbegan to appear in the wake of the shock therapy that the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) labelled the \"_big bang_ \" of January 1991. Since then,\nconsistent liberalization and astute economic management has led to the\nremoval of 95% of all price controls, low unemployment, a positive balance of\npayments position, a stable exchange rate, a shift of exports from former\ncommunist economic bloc markets to Western Europe, and relatively low foreign\ndebt. Inflation has been higher than in some other countries – mostly in the\n10% range – and the government has run consistent modest budget\ndeficits.[_citation needed_]\n\nTwo government priorities have been strict fiscal policies and creating a good\nclimate for incoming investment in the republic. Following a series of\ncurrency devaluations, the crown has remained stable in relation to the US\ndollar.[_citation needed_] The Czech crown became fully convertible for most\nbusiness purposes in late 1995.\n\nIn order to stimulate the economy and attract foreign partners, the government\nhas revamped the legal and administrative structure governing investment. With\nthe breakup of the Soviet Union, the country, till that point highly dependent\non exports to the USSR, had to make a radical shift in economic outlook: away\nfrom the East, and towards the West. This necessitated the restructuring of\nexisting banking and telecommunications facilities, as well as adjusting\ncommercial laws and practices to fit Western standards. Further minimizing\nreliance on a single major partner, successive Czech governments have welcomed\nU.S. investment (amongst others) as a counterbalance to the strong economic\ninfluence of Western European partners, especially of their powerful\nneighbour, Germany. Although foreign direct investment (FDI) runs in uneven\ncycles, with a 12.9% share of total FDI between 1990 and March 1998, the U.S.\nwas the third-largest foreign investor in the Czech economy, behind Germany\nand the Netherlands.\n\nThe country boasts a flourishing consumer production sector and has privatized\nmost state-owned heavy industries through the voucher privatization system.\nUnder the system, every citizen was given the opportunity to buy, for a\nmoderate price, a book of vouchers that represents potential shares in any\nstate-owned company. The voucher holders could then invest their vouchers,\nincreasing the capital base of the chosen company, and creating a nation of\ncitizen share-holders. This is in contrast to Russian privatization, which\nconsisted of sales of communal assets to private companies rather than share-\ntransfer to citizens. The effect of this policy has been dramatic. Under\ncommunism, state ownership of businesses was estimated to be 97%.[_citation\nneeded_] Privatization through restitution of real estate to the former owners\nwas largely completed in 1992. By 1998, more than 80% of enterprises were in\nprivate hands. Now completed,[_citation needed_] the program has made Czechs,\nwho own shares of each of the Czech companies, one of the highest per-capita\nshare owners in the world.[_citation needed_] On the other hand, by the public\nis the voucher privatisation seen mostly as unfair and source of corruption.",

In 2015, Czech Republic's economy grew by 4,2% and\nit's the fastest growing economy in the European Union. On 29 May 2015, it was\nannounced that growth of the Czech economy has increased from calculated 3,9%\nto 4,2%.\n\nCybersecurity software company Avast had its IPO on the Prague Stock Exchange\nand the London Stock Exchange in 2018.

On 9 November 2015, unemployment in the Czech\nRepublic was at 5.9%, the lowest number since February 2009. On the other\nhand, the economy suffers from dividends being paid to the foreign owners of\nCzech companies (in 2016 worth CZK 289 billion). It is seen as a hurdle to\ncatching up with the Western European economies and as a reason for salaries\nbeing only a third of neighbouring Germany or Austria.
