The sector is also affected\nby distribution services, which account for about 20 per cent of GDP, and\nmining, which accounts for another 20 per cent of the economy. Real GDP growth\nis estimated to have recovered to around 12% in 2018, after an average\ncontraction of -2.7% between 2015 and 2018, caused by frequent droughts and\nlower mining output.\n\nReported inflation in Eritrea was negative between 2016 and 2018, following\nthe exchange of currency in circulation in November 2015, which led to a\ncontraction in the money supply. Deflation persisted in 2018, as increased\ntrade with Ethiopia exerted additional downward pressure on prices.\n\nIn recent years, Eritrea has pursued a tighter fiscal policy to address\npersistent deficits that emerged after the intensification of regional\ninstability in 1998. By 2018, the country recorded a fiscal surplus of about\n11 % of GDP, mainly due to significant reductions in capital expenditures and\nthe introduction of some revenue-raising measures. However, current fiscal\npressures, including recurrent and labour-related expenditures, are expected\nto increase.\n\nShort-term growth prospects remain challenging due to fiscal constraints and\nlimited opportunities under existing restrictions. The recovery in the\nagricultural sector is expected to slow.

    "text": "In 2004, agriculture employed nearly 80 percent of the population but\naccounted for only 12.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in Eritrea.\nThe agricultural sector has improved with the use of modern farming equipment\nand techniques, and dams. Nevertheless, it is compromised by a lack of\nfinancial services and investment. Major agricultural products are sorghum,\nbarley, beans, dairy products, lentils, meat, millet, leather, teff, and\nwheat. The displacement of 1 million Eritreans as a result of the war with\nEthiopia, and the widespread presence of land mines have played a role in the\ndeclining productivity of the agricultural sector. Almost a quarter of the\ncountry's most productive land remains[_when?_] unoccupied because of the\nlingering effects of the 1998–2000 war with Ethiopia.[_citation needed_]\n\nForestry is not a significant economic activity in Eritrea.\n\nAs of 2011, the government encouraged large-scale cultivation of cactus to\nhelp alleviate the human suffering and, in the future, increase export\nrevenues. Cactus plants are said to have been introduced in 1839 by a French\nCatholic missionary who planted the cactus in Digsa, Akrur and Hebo, Southern\nregion. The second generation of cactus plants were introduced by the\nItalians, who planted them at Arberebu while they were building the Asmara\nrail lines.\n\nReliable figures on the extent and value of the fishing industry in Eritrea\nare difficult to obtain. However, Eritrea's long coastline offers the\nopportunity for significant expansion of the fishing industry from its\ncurrent, largely artisanal, stage. Eritrea exports fish and sea cucumbers from\nthe Red Sea to markets in Europe and Asia, and there is hope that the\nconstruction of a new, jet-capable airport in Massawa, as well as\nrehabilitation of the port there, may support increased exports of high-value\nseafood. In 2002, exports were about 14,000 tons, but the maximum stable yield\nis thought to be nearly 80,000 tons. A fish processing plant was built in 1998\nthat now exports 150 tons of frozen fish every month to markets in Britain,\nGermany, and the Netherlands. Tensions with Yemen over fishing rights in the\nRed Sea flared up in 1995 and again in 2002, and Eritrea's difficult relations\nwith other nations could hamper further development of the industry.",

    "text": "The official currency is the Eritrean nakfa (ERN), introduced in November\n1997. In early 2005, likely in an effort to increase foreign capital reserves,\nthe Eritrean government decreed that all transactions in Eritrea must be\nconducted in nakfa. It soon became illegal for individuals to hold and\nexchange foreign currency. As of January 1, 2005, the government set the\nforeign exchange rate at US$1=ERN15.\n\nInflation continues to be a problem in Eritrea, particularly as years of\ndrought push grain prices higher and defense expenditures remain high. The\nInternational Monetary Fund estimates that in 2003 (the most recent year for\nwhich figures are available) average inflation reached 23 percent.\n\nThe Massawa-Asmara Highway, built as part of the Wefri Warsay Yika'alo\nprogram."

    "text": "Eritrea does not publish a budget, making its fiscal condition difficult to\nassess. According to the International Monetary Fund, the overall fiscal\ndeficit in 2003 was 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Government\nexpenditures for that year were estimated to be US$375 million, with revenues\nof only US$235.7 million. In 2002 the fiscal deficit was 32 percent of GDP.\nCurrent expenditures continue to exceed budgeted spending, particularly in\ndefense and other discretionary expenditures. Monetary policy remains\nsubservient to the financing demands of the government, and debt is\nunsustainably high. This situation is not likely to change until\ndemobilization of the military occurs. According to the CIA World Factbook,\nthe Eritrean Government has revenues of $715.2 million, and outlays of $1.021\nbillion."

    "text": "China, India, South Korea, Italy, South Africa, and Germany are aggressively\npursuing market opportunities in Eritrea. There is growing interest in U.S.\nproducts and services in Eritrea, although U.S. investment in Eritrea is still\nsmall.\n\nIn 2011, Eritrea imported goods worth US$899.9 million, including machinery,\npetroleum products, food, and manufactured goods. Eritrea's main suppliers\nwere Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and South\nAfrica. In 2011 exports from Eritrea were valued at US$415.4 million, and the\nbulk were food, livestock, small manufactures, sorghum, and textiles. The\nmajor markets for Eritrean goods were China, Egypt, Italy, Saudi Arabia,\nSudan, and the UK. More recently, fish, flowers, and salt have joined the list\nof exports.\n\nForeign investment is hindered by government regulations that seek to protect\ndomestic industries from foreign competition and by a generally unfavorable\ninvestment climate. Major foreign investors in Eritrea include China, South\nKorea, Italy, South Africa, and Germany, as well as the World Bank.\n\nThe government prefers private-sector investment to official aid programs and\ndeclines foreign aid; therefore its relations with aid-dispensing nations and\ninternational institutions have often been difficult.\n\nOn 16 September 2018, Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Ethiopian Prime\nMinister Abiy Ahmed signed a peace agreement in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between\nthe two countries after a bitter war that lasted 20 years (from 1998 to 2018).\nThe two neighbouring countries ceased hostilities and restored trade and\ndiplomatic ties, and planned joint projects."
