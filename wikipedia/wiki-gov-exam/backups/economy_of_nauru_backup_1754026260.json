However, because of\nheavy spending, including poor foreign investment, the government is\nnow[_when?_] facing bankruptcy. To cut costs the government called for a\nfreeze on wages, a reduction in public service staffing, privatization of\nnumerous government agencies, and closure of some of Nauru's overseas\nconsulates.[_citation needed_] Economic uncertainty caused by financial\nmismanagement and corruption, combined with shortages of basic goods, resulted\nin domestic unrest.[_citation needed_] In 2004, Nauru was faced with chaos\namid political strife and the collapse of the island's telecommunications\nsystem. Moreover, the deterioration of housing and hospitals has\ncontinued.[_citation needed_]\n\nFew comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist, with estimates of\nNauru's GDP varying widely. According to the U.S. State Department, Nauru's\nGDP volume was US$1 million in 2004.[_need quotation to verify_] Nauru\nreceives about US$20 million foreign aid a year from Australia.\n\nThe nation's economy has grown significantly since 2012, with help from the\nreopening of the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, funded by Australia.\n\nThe most recent 2022-23 Nauru Budget recognized expected revenues of $252.5\nmillion and expenditure of $251.9 million (20% increase from Budget 2021–2022)\nwith a $549,000 surplus balance. The surplus will provide cash reserves at the\nbank and help Nauru manage future economic uncertainties.",

      "• Following its independence in 1968, Nauru had the highest GDP per capita globally, attributed to its abundant phosphate deposits.",

      "• Despite these investments, heavy government spending and poor foreign investment decisions have led Nauru to face bankruptcy, though the exact timing of this financial crisis is unspecified.",
      "• To address fiscal challenges, the government implemented cost-cutting measures including a wage freeze, reduction of public service personnel, privatization of multiple government agencies, and closure of several overseas consulates.",
      "• Financial mismanagement and corruption contributed to economic uncertainty, shortages of basic goods, and domestic unrest within Nauru.",

The\ngovernment is required to periodically fly in Australian currency to maintain\nliquidity.\n\nOn 2 June 2015, an agency of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Australia's fifth\nlargest bank, was established in Nauru by the Department of Finance. Effective\nfrom the end of April 2016, Westpac, one of Australia's largest banks, ceased\nto have any dealings with the Nauru government. On 21 April 2016, it was\nannounced that the Bendigo Bank was facing pressure also to close its\noperation in Nauru.\n\nOn 14 November 2023, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank announced its intention to\ncease operation in Nauru by December 2024. On 24 January 2024, Nauru formally\nre-established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China after\nwithdrawing recognition of Taiwan.

In 2001, Nauru was blacklisted internationally over concerns\nit had become a haven for money laundering. Amendments made in 2004 abolished\nNauru's Offshore Banking sector and, as recognised in Nauru's latest anti-\nmoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) review,\nNauru's offshore sector is now limited to a small offshore company register.\n\nIn July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\nupgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Nauru had been\nlisted alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they\ncould comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations.\nThe OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and\nthe country was given a \"largely compliant\" rating."

In 2001, Nauru signed an agreement with Australia\nto accommodate asylum seekers (mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan) on the\nisland, in return for millions of dollars in aid. This agreement, referred to\nas the \"Pacific Solution\", came to an end in 2007, prompting Nauruan concerns\nabout the future of the island's revenue. Australia has also sent financial\nexperts to Nauru to help the tiny nation overcome its economic problems.\nHowever, serious questions remain about the long-term viability of Nauru's\neconomy, with uncertainties about the rehabilitation of mined land and the\nreplacement of income from phosphates.\n\nIn 2008, talks began between Australia and Nauru regarding the future of the\nformer's economic development aid to the latter. Nauruan Foreign and Finance\nMinister Dr. Kieren Keke stated that his country did not want aid handouts.\nOne possible solution currently[_when?_] being explored would be for Australia\nto assist Nauru in setting up a \"boat repair industry\" for regional fishing\nvessels."
