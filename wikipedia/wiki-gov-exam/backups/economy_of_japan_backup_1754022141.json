    "text": "The **economy of Japan** is a highly developed mixed economy, often referred\nto as an East Asian model. According to the IMF forecast for 2025, it will be\nthe fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP as well as by purchasing\npower parity (PPP) by the end of the year. It constituted 3.7% of the world's\neconomy on a nominal basis in 2024. According to the same forecast, the\ncountry's per capita GDP (PPP) will be $54,678 (2025). Due to a volatile\ncurrency exchange rate, Japan's nominal GDP as measured in American dollars\nfluctuates sharply.\n\nA founding member of the G7 and an early member of the OECD, Japan was the\nfirst country in Asia to achieve developed country status. In 2018, Japan was\nthe fourth-largest in the world both as an importer and as an exporter. The\ncountry also has the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Japan used to run\na considerable trade surplus, but the decline of the manufacturing sector\nsince the 1980s and increased fossil fuel imports after the Fukushima nuclear\naccident in 2011 have changed this trend in recent years. Being the world's\nlargest creditor nation, Japan has a considerable net international investment\nsurplus. The country has the world's second-largest foreign-exchange reserves,\nworth $1.4 trillion. Japan has the third-largest financial assets in the\nworld, valued at $12 trillion, or 8.6% of the global GDP total as of 2020.\nJapan has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which\ncomprises roughly 23.5% of GDP. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's third-\nlargest stock exchange by market capitalisation as of 2024.\n\nJapan has a highly service-dominated economy, which contributes approximately\n70% of GDP, with most of the remainder coming from the industrial sector. The\ncountry's automobile industry, which is the second largest in the world,\ndominates the industrial sector, with Toyota being the world’s largest\nmanufacturer of cars. Japan is often ranked among the world’s most innovative\ncountries, leading several measures of global patent filings. However, its\nmanufacturing industry has lost its world dominance since the 1990s. In 2022,\nJapan spent around 3.7% of GDP on research and development. As of 2024, 40 of\nthe _Fortune Global 500_ companies are based in Japan.\n\nLong having been an agricultural country, it has been estimated that Japan’s\neconomy was among the top ten in the world by size before the industrial\nrevolution started. Industrialisation in Japan began in the second half of the\n19th century with the Meiji Restoration, initially focusing on the textile\nindustry and later on heavy industries. The country rapidly built its colonial\nempire and the third most powerful navy in the world. After the defeat in the\nSecond World War, Japan’s economy recovered and developed further rapidly,\nprimarily propelled by its lucrative manufacturing exporting industries. It\nbecame the second largest economy in the world in 1968 and remained so until\n2010, and on a nominal per capita basis, the most high-income among the G7\ncountries in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, Japan’s share of the world’s\nnominal GDP was 17.8%, reaching approximately 71% of that of the United\nStates.\n\nDriven by speculative investments and excessive lending, the Japanese asset\nprice bubble of the early 1990s burst, triggering a prolonged period of\neconomic stagnation marked by deflation and persistently low or negative\ngrowth, now known as the Lost Decades. From 1995 to 2023, the country’s GDP\nfell from $5.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion in nominal terms. At the turn of the\n21st century, the Bank of Japan set out to encourage growth through a policy\nof quantitative easing, with the central bank purchasing government bonds at\nan unprecedented scale to address the persisting deflationary pressure. In\n2016, the Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest policy to stimulate\neconomic growth and combat persistent deflationary pressure. A combination of\ndomestic policies and global economic conditions helped the country achieve\nits 2% inflation target, leading to the conclusion of the policy in 2024.\n\nAs of 2021, Japan has significantly higher public debt than other developed\nnations, at approximately 260% of GDP. 45% of this debt is held by the Bank of\nJapan, and most of the remainder is also held domestically. The Japanese\neconomy faces considerable challenges posed by an ageing and declining\npopulation, which peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010 and has fallen to\n122.6 million people in 2024. In 2022, the country's working age population\nconsisted of approximately 59.4% of the total population, which was the lowest\nrate among all the OECD countries. According to 2023 government projections,\nthe country's population will fall to 87 million by 2070, with only 45 million\nof working age.",

As a consequence Japan ran massive\nbudget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to\nfinance large public works programs.\n\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough\nto end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government\nundertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses\nfrom the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led\nJapan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of\nJapan used quantitative easing to expand the country's money supply in order\nto raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the\npolicy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect\ninflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems\nto be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an\nannualised fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of\nthe US and European Union during the same period.

This\nled some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians, to\nadvocate the generation of higher inflation expectations. In July 2006, the\nzero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the\nlowest interest rates in the developed world, but deflation had still not been\neliminated and the Nikkei 225 has fallen over approximately 50% (between June\n2007 and December 2008). However, on 5 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced\nthat it would be purchasing 60–70 trillion yen in bonds and securities in an\nattempt to eliminate deflation by doubling the money supply in Japan over the\ncourse of two years. Markets around the world have responded positively to the\ngovernment's current proactive policies, with the Nikkei 225 adding more than\n42% since November 2012. _The Economist_ has suggested that improvements to\nbankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax laws will aid Japan's economy. In\nrecent years, Japan has been the top export market for almost 15 trading\nnations worldwide.\n\nIn December 2018, a free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union\nwas cleared to commence in February 2019. It creates the world's largest free\ntrade zone valued at 1/3rd of global gross domestic product.

The total public debt of the\ncountry, which includes debts contracted by local governments, represents\n1.210 million billion yen (9,200 billion dollars) which is nearly 250% of\nJapan's GDP. Economist Kohei Iwahara said such an exceptional debt to GDP\nlevel is only possible because Japanese hold most of the debt: \"“Japanese\nhouseholds hold most of their savings in bank accounts (48%) and these sums\nare used by commercial banks to buy Japanese government bonds. Thus, 85.7% of\nthese bonds are held by Japanese investors.”\n\nThe Bank of Japan's main policy aim since the Lost Decades started had been to\nend deflation and eventually achieve 2% inflation. The increased international\neconomic tension brought about by events such as the Russian Invasion of\nUkraine in 2022 finally helped the country achieve the much-anticipated\ninflation target of 2%, and the negative interest policy since 2016 was ended\nin March 2024. However, while other major economies focus on suppressing\ninflation by raising interest rates, Japan aims to firmly establish inflation\nby maintaining low rates. As a side effect, the Japanese yen has become\nextremely weak, hitting a 37.5-year low of 161 yen/USD in July 2024.\nFurthermore, the real effective exchange rate in May 2024, when the 2020\naverage is set at 100, is 68.65, the lowest level since the start of the Bank\nof Japan statistics in January 1970, due to a combination of low inflation in\nJapan and a relatively low trade share. This devaluation of the currency\ncaused Japan to lose its status as the world’s third largest economy to\nGermany in nominal terms, which was approximately half the size of the\ncountry's economy a decade earlier.\n\nFactors such as an apparent end to the 30-year struggle against deflation,\nimprovements in corporate governance, and high corporate profits boosted the\nstock market. Consequently, both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices surpassed\nthe record highs they reached more than 30 years ago in 2024.

Nuclear power in Japan made a quarter of\nelectricity production but due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster there\nhas been a large desire to end Japan's nuclear power program. In September\n2013, Japan closed its last 50 nuclear power plants nationwide, causing the\nnation to be nuclear free. The country has since then opted to restart a few\nof its nuclear reactors.\n\nJapan's spendings on roads has been considered large. The 1.2 million\nkilometers of paved road are one of the major means of transportation. Japan\nhas left-hand traffic. A single network of speed, divided, limited-access toll\nroads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises.\nNew and used cars are inexpensive, and the Japanese government has encouraged\npeople to buy hybrid vehicles. Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to\npromote energy-efficiency.\n\nRail transport is a major means of transport in Japan. Dozens of Japanese\nrailway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation\nmarkets; for instance, 6 passenger JR enterprises, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu\nRailway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain\nreal estate or department stores next to stations, and many major stations\nhave major department stores near them. The Japanese cities of Fukuoka, Kobe,\nKyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama all have subway\nsystems. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All\ntrains are known for punctuality, and a delay of 90 seconds can be considered\nlate for some train services.\n\nThere are 98 passenger and 175 total airports in Japan, and flying is a\npopular way to travel. The largest domestic airport, Tokyo International\nAirport, is Asia's second busiest airport. The largest international gateways\nare Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport\n(Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya\narea). The largest ports in Japan include Nagoya Port, the Port of Yokohama,\nthe Port of Tokyo and the Port of Kobe.\n\nAbout 84% of Japan's energy is imported from other countries. Japan is the\nworld's largest liquefied natural gas importer, second largest coal importer,\nand third largest net oil importer. Given its heavy dependence on imported\nenergy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources. Since the oil shocks of the\n1970s, Japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from\n77.4% in 1973 to about 43.7% in 2010 and increased dependence on natural gas\nand nuclear power. In September 2019, Japan will invest 10 billion on\nliquefied natural gas projects worldwide, in a strategy to boost the global\nLNG market and reinforce the security of energy supply. Other important energy\nsource includes coal, and hydroelectricity is Japan's biggest renewable energy\nsource. Japan's solar market is also currently booming. Kerosene is also used\nextensively for home heating in portable heaters, especially farther north.\nMany taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied natural gas. A recent\nsuccess towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass-produced\nhybrid vehicles. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, who was working on Japan's\neconomic revival, signed a treaty with Saudi Arabia and UAE about the rising\nprices of oil, ensuring Japan's stable deliveries from that region."

One major long-term concern for the\nJapanese labor force is its low birthrate. In 2005, the number of deaths in\nJapan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population\nhad already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would\nbe to increase immigration, Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants\ndespite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled\nworkers) compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when\nlooking at Japan's work visa programme for \"specified skilled worker\", which\nhad less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000\noverseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting\nmigrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration\npolicies. A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to\nJapan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country's low\nmigrant inflow.\n\nIn 1989, the predominantly public sector union confederation, SOHYO (General\nCouncil of Trade Unions of Japan), merged with RENGO (Japanese Private Sector\nTrade Union Confederation) to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation.\nLabor union membership is about 12 million.\n\nAs of 2019 Japan's unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7.

    "text": "_Nemawashi_ (根回し), 'consensus building', in Japanese culture is an informal\nprocess of quietly laying the foundation for some proposed change or project,\nby talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so\nforth. It is considered an important element in any major change, before any\nformal steps are taken, and successful _nemawashi_ enables changes to be\ncarried out with the consent of all sides.\n\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"The Toyota Way\".\n_Kaizen_ (改善, Japanese for 'improvement') is a Japanese philosophy that\nfocuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied\nto the workplace, _kaizen_ activities continually improve all functions of a\nbusiness, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly\nline workers. By improving standardised activities and processes, Kaizen aims\nto eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). _Kaizen_ was first implemented in\nseveral Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II,\nincluding Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. The\ncorporate application of the _kaizen_ system has been criticised for\nneglecting or harming the quality of life of workers, particularly via the\nimplementation of long working hours. However, according to the OECD, Japan's\naverage for annual hours worked per employee is lower than the OECD average\nand middling among G7 countries.\n\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and _shuntō_. The _nenko_\nsystem or _nenko joretsu_ as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of\npreferring to promote employees close to retirement. This is done to\nprioritise experience in executive positions and to allow older employees to\nachieve a higher salary level before retirement. The _nenko_ system has been\ncriticised for leaving younger employees at a disadvantage against older\nemployees who may be less capable.\n\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close.\nAmakudari (天下り, _amakudari_ , 'descent from heaven') is the institutionalised\npractice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in\nthe private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt\nand a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the\nstate that prevent economic and political reforms. Lifetime employment\n(_shūshin koyō_) and seniority-based career advancement have been common in\nthe Japanese work environment. These practices have become less common in\nrecent years.\n\nSalaryman (サラリーマン, __Sararīman__ , salaried man) refers to someone whose\nincome is salary-based; particularly those working for corporations. Coined in\nJapan, the word's frequent use by Japanese corporations and its prevalence in\nJapanese manga and anime has led to its adoption into and common usage within\nthe English language to refer to Japanese white-collar workers, and it can be\nfound in many English-language books and articles pertaining to Japanese\nculture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed\nas a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term\ncarries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate\nhierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, wage\nslavery, and _karōshi_. The term _salaryman_ refers almost exclusively to\nmales.[_citation needed_]\n\nAn office lady, often abbreviated OL (Japanese: オーエル _Ōeru_), is a female\noffice worker in Japan who performs generally pink collar tasks such as\nserving tea and doing secretarial or clerical work. Like many unmarried\nJapanese, OLs often live with their parents well into early adulthood. Office\nladies are usually full-time permanent staff, with little opportunity for\npromotion, and there is often a tacit expectation that they leave their jobs\nif they get married.[_citation needed_]\n\nFreeter (フリーター, _furītā_) is a Japanese expression for people between the age\nof 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding\nhomemakers and students. They may also be described as _underemployed_ or\nfreelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or\nuniversity but instead usually live as parasite singles with their parents and\nearn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. Low income makes it\ndifficult for freeters to start a family, and lacking qualifications in the\nform of skilled labor experience makes it difficult for them to start a career\nat a later point in life.[_citation needed_]\n\nKarōshi (過労死, __karōshi__), which can be translated quite literally from\nJapanese as \"death from overwork\", is occupational sudden death. The major\nmedical causes of karōshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n\nSōkaiya (総会屋, _sōkaiya_), (sometimes also translated as 'corporate bouncers',\n'meeting-men', or 'corporate blackmailers') are a form of specialised\nracketeer unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza, who extort\nmoney from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate\ncompanies and their management, usually in their annual meeting (総会, _sōkai_).\nSarakin (サラ金) is a Japanese term for 'moneylender' or 'loan shark'. It is a\ncontraction of the Japanese words for 'salaryman' and 'cash'. Around 14\nmillion people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a\n_sarakin_. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade\nago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of\noutstanding loans totals 100 billion. The biggest _sarakin_ are publicly\ntraded and often allied with big banks.\n\nThe first \"Western-style\" department store in Japan (called デパート, _depāto_)\nwas Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called\nEchigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an\neven longer history, dating back to 1611 and becoming a department store in\n1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn\nindoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department\nstores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold luxurious\nproducts which contributed to them having sophisticated atmospheres. From the\n1920s, private railway operators started to build department stores directly\nlinked to their lines' terminuses. Seibu and Hankyu are examples of this\npractice. From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores have faced fierce\ncompetition from supermarkets and convenience stores, and they have gradually\ndeclined in prominence. Still, _depāto_ are seen as bastions of cultural\nconservatism in the country. Gift certificates for department stores are\nfrequently given as presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally\noffer a wide range of services which can include foreign exchange, travel\nreservations, and ticket sales for local concerts and other events.[_citation\nneeded_]"

The Allies dismantled the _zaibatsu_ in the late 1940s, but the\ncompanies formed from the dismantling of the _zaibatsu_ were reintegrated. The\ndispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form\nhorizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible,\n_keiretsu_ companies would also supply one another, making the alliances\nvertically integrated as well. In this period, official government policy\npromoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand\npressures from intensified world trade competition.\n\nThe major _keiretsu_ were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the\n_keiretsu_ 's member companies and held equity positions in the companies.\nEach central bank had great control over the companies in the _keiretsu_ and\nacted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect\nof this structure was to minimise the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan,\nbecause no entities could challenge the power of the banks.[_citation needed_]\n\nThere are two types of _keiretsu_ : vertical and horizontal. Vertical\n_keiretsu_ illustrates the organisation and relationships within a company\n(for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected),\nwhile a horizontal _keiretsu_ shows relationships between entities and\nindustries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are\ncomplexly woven together and sustain each other.\n\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the _keiretsu_.\nMany of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to\nmerge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between\nthe _keiretsu_ : Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo\nMitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the\nHankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, now known as\nMUFG Bank. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such\nas Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community\nthat the old _keiretsu_ system was not an effective business model, and led to\nan overall loosening of _keiretsu_ alliances. While the _keiretsu_ still\nexist, they are not as centralised or integrated as they were before the\n1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in\nJapan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their\nbanks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent\nshareholders.[_citation needed_]"
