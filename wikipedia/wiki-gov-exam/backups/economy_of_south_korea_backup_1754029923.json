By nominal\nGDP, the economy was worth ₩2.61 quadrillion (US$1.87 trillion). It has the\n4th largest economy in Asia and the 13th largest in the world as of 2025.\nSouth Korea is notable for its rapid economic development from an\nunderdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few decades.\nThis economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which\nhas allowed it to join the OECD and the G20. It is included in the group of\nNext Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the\nglobal economy by the middle of the 21st century. Among OECD members, South\nKorea has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social\nexpenditure stood at roughly 15.5% of GDP. South Korea spends around 4.93% of\nGDP on advanced research and development across various sectors of the\neconomy.\n\nSouth Korea's education system and the establishment of a motivated and\neducated populace were largely responsible for spurring the country's high\ntechnology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an\nexport-oriented economic strategy to fuel its economy. In 2022, South Korea\nwas the ninth largest exporter and ninth largest importer in the world. The\nBank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major\neconomic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.\n\nRenowned financial organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund,\nnote the resilience of the South Korean economy against various economic\ncrises. They cite the country's economic advantages as reasons for this\nresilience, including low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly\nbe mobilised to address any expected financial emergencies. Other financial\norganisations, like the World Bank, describe South Korea as one of the\nfastest-growing major economies of the next generation, along with BRICS and\nIndonesia. South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to\navoid a recession during the Great Recession. Its economic growth rate reached\n6.2% in 2010, a recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2%\nin 2009 during the Great Recession. The South Korean economy again recovered\nwith a record surplus of US$70.7 billion at the end of 2013, up 47 percent\ngrowth from 2012. This growth contrasted with the uncertainties of global\neconomic turmoil, with the country's major economic output being technology\nproducts exports.\n\nDespite the South Korean economy's high growth and structural stability, South\nKorea is experiencing damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to\nNorth Korea in times of military crises. The recurring conflict affects the\nfinancial markets of its economy. The South Korean economy faces challenges\ndue to a declining and ageing population, with a fertility rate among the\nlowest in the world.",

    "text": "Growth of the South Korean economy 1961–2015 Economy of South Korea, compared\nto North Korea. North Korea began to lose the economic competition after its\nadoption of _Juche_ in 1974.\n\nFollowing the coup that brought General Park Chung Hee to power in 1961, which\nat first caused political instability and an economic crisis, a protectionist\neconomic policy began, pushing a bourgeoisie that developed in the shadow of\nthe State to reactivate the internal market. To promote development, a policy\nof export-oriented industrialisation was applied, closing the entry into the\ncountry of all kinds of foreign products, except raw materials. Agrarian\nreforms were carried out and Park nationalised the financial system to swell\nthe powerful state arm, whose intervention in the economy was through five-\nyear plans.\n\nThe spearhead was the chaebols, diversified family conglomerates such as\nHyundai, Samsung, and LG Corporation, which received state incentives such as\ntax breaks, legality for their exploitation system and cheap or free\nfinancing: the state bank facilitated the planning of concentrated loans by\nitem according to each five-year plan, and by economic group selected to lead\nit.\n\nSouth Korea received donations from the United States due to the Cold War, and\nforeign economic and military support continued for some years. Chaebols\nstarted to dominate the domestic economy and, eventually, began to become\ninternationally competitive. Under these chaebols, workers began to see their\nwages and working conditions improve, which increased domestic consumption. By\nthe 1980s, the country rose from low income to middle income.\n\nSouth Korea's real GDP expanded by an average of more than 8 percent per year,\nfrom US$2.7 billion in 1962 to US$230 billion in 1989, breaking the trillion\ndollar mark in the early 2000s. Nominal GDP per capita grew from $103.88 in\n1962 to $5,438.24 in 1989, reaching the $20,000 milestone in 2006. The\nmanufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent\nin 1987. Commodity trade volume rose from US$480 million in 1962 to a\nprojected US$127.9 billion in 1990. The ratio of domestic savings to GNP grew\nfrom 3.3 percent in 1962 to 35.8 percent in 1989. In the early 1960s, South\nKorea's rate of growth exceeded North Korea's rate of growth in most\nindustrial areas.\n\nThe most significant factor in rapid industrialisation was the adoption of an\noutward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. This strategy was particularly\nwell-suited to that time because of South Korea's low savings rate and small\ndomestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through labour-\nintensive manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a\ncompetitive advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this\nprocess. Through the model of export-led industrialisation, the South Korean\ngovernment incentivised corporations to develop new technology and upgrade\nproductive efficiency to compete the global market. By adhering to state\nregulations and demands, firms were awarded subsidisation and investment\nsupport to develop their export markets in the evolving international arena.\nIn addition, the inflow of foreign capital was encouraged to supplement the\nshortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve\ngrowth in exports and subsequent increases in income.\n\nBeginning in 1973, South Korea's government used its National Investment Fund\nand the Korea Development Bank to invest large amounts of money into what Park\nChung Hee's government viewed as the six strategic industries: steel, non-\nferrous metals, shipbuilding, industrial machinery, electronics, and\npetrochemicals. This developmental approach was frequently criticized at the\ntime from outside Korea, including by the World Bank. The strategy was\nsuccessful and ultimately also helped develop companies like Samsung and POSCO\nand reduced input costs for production in downstream industries as well.\n\nBy emphasising the industrial sector, Seoul's export-oriented development\nstrategy left the rural sector barely touched. The steel and shipbuilding\nindustries in particular played key roles in developing South Korea's economy\nduring this time. Except for mining, most industries were located in the urban\nareas of the northwest and southeast. Heavy industries were located in the\nsouth of the country. Factories in Seoul contributed over 25 percent of all\nmanufacturing value-added in 1978; taken together with factories in the\nsurrounding Gyeonggi Province, factories in the Seoul area produced 46 percent\nof all manufacturing that year. Factories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province\nemployed 48 percent of the nation's 2.1 million factory workers. Increased\nincome disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a\nproblem by the 1970s despite government efforts to raise farm income and\nimprove rural areas\n\nSouth Korean inflation\n\nM2 money supply increases\n\nInflation\n\nInflation ex food and energy\n\nIn the early 1980s, in order to control inflation, a conservative monetary\npolicy and tight fiscal measures were adopted. Growth of the money supply was\nreduced from the 30 percent level of the 1970s to 15 percent. During this\ntime, Seoul froze its budget for a short while. Government intervention in the\neconomy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment\nwere liberalised to promote competition. To reduce the imbalance between rural\nand urban sectors, Seoul expanded investments in public projects, such as\nroads and communications facilities, while further promoting farm\nmechanisation.\n\nThe measures implemented early in the decade, coupled with significant\nimprovements in the world economy, helped South Korea regain its lost\nmomentum. South Korea achieved an average of 9.2 percent real growth between\n1982 and 1987 and 12.5 percent between 1986 and 1988. The double-digit\ninflation of the 1970s was brought under control. Wholesale price inflation\naveraged 2.1 percent per year from 1980 through 1988; consumer prices\nincreased by an average of 4.7 percent annually. Seoul achieved its first\nsignificant surplus in its balance of payments in 1986 and recorded a US$7.7\nbillion and a US$11.4 billion surplus in 1987 and 1988 respectively. This\ndevelopment permitted South Korea to begin reducing its level of foreign debt.\nThe trade surplus for 1989, however, was only US$4.6 billion, and a small\nnegative balance was projected for 1990."

During the 1997 Asian\nfinancial crisis, after several other Asian currencies were attacked by\nspeculators, the Korean won started to depreciate in October 1997. The problem\nwas exacerbated due to non-performing loans at many of Korea's merchant banks.\nBy December 1997, the IMF had approved a US$21 billion loan, that would be\npart of a US$58.4 billion bailout plan. By January 1998, the government had\nshut down a third of Korea's merchant banks.

    "text": "South Korea's economy has moved away from a centrally planned, government-\ndirected investment model toward a more market-oriented one. These economic\nreforms, pushed by President Kim Dae-jung, helped South Korea maintain one of\nAsia's few expanding economies,[_citation needed_] with growth rates of 10.8%\nin 1999 and 9.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the\nslowing global economy, decreased exports, and perceptions that corporate and\nfinancial reforms had stalled.\n\nAfter the bounce back from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the economy\ncontinued strong growth in 2000 with a GDP growth of 9.08%. However, the South\nKorean economy was affected by the September 11 attacks. The slowing global\neconomy, falling exports, and the perception that corporate and financial\nreforms had stalled caused growth to decrease to 3.8% in 2001 Thanks to\nindustrialisation GDP per hour worked (labour output) more than tripled from\nUS$2.80 in 1963 to US$10.00 in 1989. More recently the economy stabilised and\nmaintained a growth rate of between 4–5% from 2003 onwards.\n\nLed by industry and construction, growth in 2002 was 5.8%, despite anemic\nglobal growth. The restructuring of chaebols, bank privatisation, and the\ncreation of a more liberalised economy—with a mechanism for bankrupt firms to\nexit the market—remain an unfinished reform task. Growth slowed in 2003, but\nproduction expanded 5% in 2006, due to popular demand for key export products\nsuch as HDTVs and mobile phones.[_citation needed_]\n\nLike most industrialised economies, South Korea experienced setbacks during\nthe Great Recession. Growth fell by 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from\nthe previous quarter, the first negative quarterly growth in 10 years, with\nyear on year quarterly growth continuing to be negative into 2009. Many\nsectors of the economy at the time reported declines, with manufacturing\ndropping 25.6% as of January 2009, and consumer goods sales dropping 3.1%.\nExports in autos and semiconductors, two pillars of the economy, shrank 55.9%\nand 46.9% respectively, while exports overall fell by a record 33.8% in\nJanuary, and 18.3% in February 2009 year on year. As in the 1997 Asian\nfinancial crisis, Korean currency also experienced massive fluctuations,\ndeclining by 34% against the US dollar. Annual growth in the economy slowed to\n2.3% in 2008, and was expected to drop to as low as −4.5% by Goldman Sachs,\nbut South Korea was able to limit the downturn to a standstill at 0.2% in\n2009. Despite the Great Recession, the South Korean economy, helped by timely\nstimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated\nfor decreased exports, was able to avoid a recession unlike most\nindustrialised economies, posting positive economic growth for two consecutive\nyears of the crisis. In 2010, South Korea made an economic rebound with a\ngrowth rate of 6.1%, signaling a return of the economy to pre-crisis levels.\nSouth Korea's exports recorded $424 billion in the first eleven months of the\nyear 2010, already higher than its export in the whole year of 2008. The South\nKorean economy of the 21st century, as a Next Eleven economy, is expected to\ngrow from 3.9% to 4.2% annually between 2011 and 2030, similar to growth rates\nof developing countries such as Brazil or Russia.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye at a breakfast meeting with chaebol\nbusiness magnates Lee Kun-hee and Chung Mong-koo in 2013\n\nThe South Korean government signed the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement\n(KAFTA) on 5 December 2013, with the Australian government seeking to benefit\nits industries—including automotive, services, and resources and energy—and\nposition itself alongside competitors, such as the U.S. and ASEAN. South Korea\nis Australia's third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner\nwith a 2012 trade value of A$32 billion. The agreement contains an Investor\nState Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause that permits legal action from South\nKorean corporations against the Australian government if their trade rights\nare infringed upon.\n\nThe government cut the work week from six days to five in phases, from 2004 to\n2011, depending on the size of the firm. The number of public holidays was\nexpanded to 16 by 2013.\n\nSouth Korean economy decreased in the first quarter of 2019, which happened to\nbe its worst drop since the Great Recession. GDP declined a seasonally\nadjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter.\n\nSouth Korea's prices rose more than 6 percent in July compared with last year,\nthe fastest jump in nearly a quarter century.\n\nIn July 2022, South Korea's Consumer price index rose 6.3 percent, the highest\nrate since November 1998."

This\nshift in emphasis, however, did not mean an immediate decline in heavy\nindustries such as automobile and ship production, which had dominated the\neconomy in the 1980s.[_citation needed_]\n\nSouth Korea relies upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy, with\nfinished products such as electronics, textiles, ships, automobiles, and steel\nbeing some of its most important exports. Although the import market has\nliberalised in recent years, the agricultural market has remained\nprotectionist due to disparities in the price of domestic agricultural\nproducts such as rice with the international market. As of 2005, the price of\nrice in South Korea was four times that of the average price of rice on the\ninternational market, and it was believed that opening the agricultural market\nwould affect South Korean agricultural sector negatively. In late 2004,\nhowever, an agreement was reached with the WTO in which South Korean rice\nimports will gradually increase from 4% to 8% of consumption by 2014. In\naddition, up to 30% of imported rice will be made available directly to\nconsumers by 2010, where previously imported rice was only used for processed\nfoods. Following 2014, the South Korean rice market will be fully\nopened.[_citation needed_]\n\nSouth Korea today is known as the Launchpad of a mature mobile market, where\ndevelopers thrive in a market where few technology constraints exist. There is\na growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, using the 4G and\n5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea today has the\ninfrastructure to meet a density of population and culture that has the\ncapability to create strong local particularities."

    "text": "South Korea faced a turning point in its economy in 2023. With the constant\ngrowth of mainland China's manufacturing industry and the impact of COVID-19,\nSouth Korea's manufacturing sector is experiencing a consistent decline.\nAccording to SP Global, South Korea's export of manufactured goods to mainland\nChina, one of the biggest trading partners of South Korea, had decreased by\n4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and by 31% in January 2023. On the other\nhand, their primary electronic manufacturing industry is facing a downturn.\nWhile information and communication technology maintained 34% of South Korea's\ntotal 2022 exports, at the end of the year, it decreased to 24%. The\ngovernment had to incur a massive fiscal spending in 2020, leading a rise in\nthe fiscal deficit as projected in their budget. Moreover, their forecasted\ndebt-to-GDP ratio jumped to 41.2% of GDP in 2020 from 37.1% of GDP in 2019. In\n2021, the government unveiled a $29 billion extra budget to aid small\nbusinesses and boost employment. In 2024, the government forecast a debt-to-\nGDP ratio was 47.4% of GDP.\n\nWith downturns in many manufacturing industries, South Korea has been facing a\nrecession. Many economists state the reason for industries' slowdown as\ndeteriorating global conditions. The inflation rate in South Korea is\nregularly rising, and the problems in the domestic economy, such as household\ndebt, population problems, and productivity problems, are the key fiscal and\nmonetary factors that hold South Korea's economic growth.\n\nDue to the sudden evolution of COVID-19, private consumption decreased, and a\nbottleneck in the supply sector occurred. With this situation, the Bank of\nKorea indicated that the consumer inflation rate rose about three percent\nafter COVID-19 evolved. Assuming that South Korea's interest rate was low\ncompared to other countries, raising house prices and household debt became\none of the problems in South Korea's economy. To stabilise the inflated\neconomy, the government has passed the \"Korean New Deal Program\" to invest 144\nbillion dollars. This expansionary fiscal policy promoted private consumption\nand increased the number of jobs. This expansionary fiscal stimulus is\ndesigned to recover the economic and social impact of COVID-19 from the\nexisting climate and environmental dangers. The New Deal policy is divided\nexplicitly into healthcare and green industries.\n\nSouth Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance asserted the New Growth Strategy\n4.0 in August 2023. The New Growth Strategy suggests projects for South\nKorea's long-term industry growth. The South Korean government advocates these\npolicies as a New Growth 4.0 project, which aims to generate tangible outcomes\nin the future by setting the focus of policy and investments towards emerging\nindustries. To achieve these goals, the strategy outlines the following key\nguidelines:\n\n1. Foster AI semiconductor industries and build up a collaborative ecosystem between businesses.\n2. Dominate the global market of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry.\n3. Secure Clean Hydrogen Production Technology via Water Electrolysis.\n4. Advance Autonomous Driving Technologies.\n5. Promote the Battery Re-manufacturing and Reuse Markets.\n6. Expand the Private Sector-led My Data Based Services.\n7. Streamline the Ordering Process of Research Equipment or Facilities to Alleviate Administrative Burdens.\n\nBesides this, South Korea is one of the countries with excellent healthcare\nsystems, biomedical technology, and AI technology. While South Korea's value\nin the medical industry is projected at around 6.7 billion dollars, the\nmedical technology market is projected to reach 11.5 billion dollars. The\nannual projected growth rate of the medical industry is over 6%, which\nindicates a bright future for the industry. Many economists suggest that by\nadopting AI technology, South Korea will be a bio-medical industry-leading\ncountry. An article about the future data-driven healthcare industry in South\nKorea suggests that AI technology helps the medical industry provide\ncustomised medical services for patients and can utilise the benefits and\ncosts.\n\nIn April 2025, the incorporation of Korean government bonds into the \"World\nGovernment Bond Index\" was postponed from November this year to April next\nyear. After being listed as a prospective candidate for incorporation in\nSeptember 2022, it was successfully included in the regular market\nclassification report in the second half of October 2024."

The country's major\nshipbuilder was Hyundai, which built a 1-million-ton capacity drydock at Ulsan\nin the mid-1970s. Daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in 1980 and finished\na 1.2-million-ton facility at Okpo on Geoje Island, south of Busan, in\nmid-1981. The industry declined in the mid-1980s because of the oil glut and\nbecause of a worldwide recession. There was a sharp decrease in new orders in\nthe late 1980s; new orders for 1988 totaled 3 million gross tons valued at\nUS$1.9 billion, decreases from the previous year of 17.8 percent and 4.4\npercent, respectively. These declines were caused by labour unrest, Seoul's\nunwillingness to provide financial assistance, and Tokyo's new low-interest\nexport financing in support of Japanese shipbuilders. However, the South\nKorean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early 1990s because\nolder ships in world fleets needed replacing. South Korea eventually became\nthe world's dominant shipbuilder with a 50.6% share of the global shipbuilding\nmarket as of 2008. Notable Korean shipbuilders are Hyundai Heavy Industries,\nSamsung Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and the now bankrupt STX Offshore &\nShipbuilding."

    "text": "Since 1991, there has been a steady upwards trend in South Korean M&A until\n2018 with only a short break around 2004. Since 1991, around 18,300 deals in,\ninto or out of South Korea have been announced, which sum up to a total value\nof over 941 bil. USD. 2016 has been the year with the largest deal value\n(1,818 in bil. USD) and the most deals (82,3).\n\nTarget industries are distributed very evenly with no industry taking a larger\nshare than 10%. The top three target industries are electronics (9.7%),\nsemiconductors (9.1%) and metals and mining (7.7%). However, over 51% of the\nacquiring companies originate from the financial and brokerage\nsector.[_citation needed_]"
