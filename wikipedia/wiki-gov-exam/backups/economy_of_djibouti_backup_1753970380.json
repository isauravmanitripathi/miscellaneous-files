    "text": "The **economy of Djibouti** is derived in large part from its strategic\nlocation on the Red Sea. Djibouti is mostly barren, with little development in\nthe agricultural and industrial sectors. The country has a harsh climate, a\nlargely unskilled labour force, and limited natural resources. The country's\nmost important economic asset is its strategic location, connecting the Red\nSea and the Gulf of Aden. As such, Djibouti's economy is commanded by the\nservices sector, providing services as both a transit port for the region and\nas an international transshipment and refueling centre.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1994, Djibouti experienced a civil war which had devastating\neffects on the economy. Since then, the country has benefited from political\nstability. In recent years, Djibouti has seen significant improvement in\nmacroeconomic stability, with its annual gross domestic product improving at\nan average of over 3 percent since 2003. This comes after a decade of negative\nor low growth and is attributed to fiscal adjustment aimed at improving public\nfinancing, reforms in port management and foreign investment.\n\nDespite the recent modest and stable growth, Djibouti is faced with many\neconomic challenges, particularly job creation and poverty reduction. With an\naverage annual population growth rate of 2.5 percent, the economy cannot\nsignificantly benefit national income per capita growth. Unemployment is\nextremely high, with some estimates placing it at almost 60 percent, and is a\nmajor contributor to widespread poverty. In recent years, the country's\ndependence on Chinese investment and debt has also come under scrutiny.\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the World bank, Djibouti was 112th among 190\neconomies when it comes to the ease of doing business.",

From 2003 to 2005, annual\nreal GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent in the mid-2000s, driven by good\nperformance in the services sector, strong consumption and reached a value as\nhigh as 7.8 percent in 2019. In the 21st century, Inflation has been kept low\nthrough fixed pegging of the Djibouti franc to the US dollar, but experienced\na sharp spike in the late 2000s, when it reached values three times higher\nthan the average of the last 20 years.\n\nDespite experiencing economic growth, the country continues to struggle with\nhigh unemployment. Official numbers put the unemployment rate at just over 10\npercent, but international estimates consider it to be closer to 60 percent.\nFurthermore, reliance on diesel-generated electricity and the need to import\nbasic necessities like food and water leave average consumers vulnerable to\nglobal price shocks.\n\nDjibouti's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6\npercent per year, from US$341 million in 1985 to US$3.3 billion in 2019.\n\nLow tax revenue and high spending on public infrastructure has seen Djibouti\nstruggle with its budget deficit.

Conditions of the structural adjustment\nagreement recently signed by Djibouti and the International Monetary Fund\nstipulate increased privatization of parastatal and government-owned\nmonopolies. There are no patent laws in Djibouti.\n\nFurthermore, there are concerns about the rule of law, the independence of\ncourts, and how this affects the protection of investments in the country. A\nFreedom House report, for example, mentions the case of Dubai-based port\noperator DP World which has been embroiled in a legal battle with Djibouti\nsince 2012, \"when Djibouti sold part of its concession in the Doraleh\nContainer Terminal to a Chinese state-owned competitor of DP World, the\noriginal concession partner.\"\n\nIn 2018, Djibouti seized DP World's port assets, but ruling the\nnationalization illegal, the London Court of International Arbitration in 2019\nordered Djibouti to restore the rights and benefits of the concession to DP\nWorld. The country subsequently rejected the ruling and asked the Djibouti\nhigh court to unilaterally nullify the LCIA decision.\n\nA Santander report concluded that despite its strategic importance, FDI into\nDjibouti is hampered by \"mediocre governance, corruption, the lack of a sound\njudicial framework, an unstable regional geopolitical situation, a poorly\ndiversified economy with little resilience to outside shocks, and a fragile\necosystem prone to environmental crisis.\"\n\nAs in most African nations, access to licenses and approvals is complicated\nnot so much by law as by administrative procedures. In Djibouti, the\nadministrative process has been characterized as a form of 'circular\ndependency.' For example, the finance ministry will issue a license only if an\ninvestor possesses an approved investor visa, while the interior ministry will\nonly issue an investor visa to a licensed business. The Djiboutian government\nis increasingly realizing the importance of establishing a one-stop shop to\nfacilitate the investment process.",
