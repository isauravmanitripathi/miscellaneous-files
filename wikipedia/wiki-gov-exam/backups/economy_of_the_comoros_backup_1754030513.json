    "text": "The **economy of the Comoros** is based on subsistence agriculture and\nfishing. Comoros has inadequate transportation links, a young and rapidly\nincreasing population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of\nthe labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high\nunemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical\nassistance. The Comoros, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) per\ncapita income of about $700, is among the world's poorest and least developed\nnations. Although the quality of the land differs from island to island, most\nof the widespread lava-encrusted soil formations are unsuited to agriculture.\nAs a result, most of the inhabitants make their living from subsistence\nagriculture and fishing. Average wages in 2007 hover around $3–4 per day.\n\nAgriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector\nof the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and\nprovides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food\nproduction; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports.\n\nThe government is working to upgrade education and technical training, to\nprivatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services,\nto diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population\ngrowth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual\nGDP growth is to be met. At 24 percent of GDP, remittances constitute an\nimportant source of inflows for the Comorian economy.\n\nThe GDP per capita of the Comoros grew 55% in the 1980s. But this proved\nunsustainable and it consequently shrank by 42% in the 1990s.",

    "text": "GDP per capita development, since 1950\n\nDuring the colonial period, the French and local leading citizens established\nplantations to grow cash crops for export. Even after independence, French\ncompanies, such as Société Bambao and Établissements Grimaldi — and other\nconcerns, such as Kalfane and Company and later, President Abdallah's\nÉtablissements Abdallah et Fils—dominated the Comoran economy. These firms\ndiverted most of their profits overseas, investing little in the\ninfrastructure of the islands beyond what was needed for profitable management\nof the plantations, or what could benefit these businesses' associates or\nrelated concerns. A serious consequence of this approach has been the\nlanguishing of the food-crop agricultural sector and the resultant dependence\non overseas food imports, particularly rice. In 1993 the Comoros remained\nhostage to fluctuating prices on the international market for such crops as\nvanilla, ylang-ylang, and cloves.\n\nThe Comoros is one of the world's poorest countries; its per capita gross\nnational product (GNP—see Glossary) was estimated at US$400 in 1994, following\nthe January devaluation of the Comorian franc. Although GNP increased in real\nterms at an average annual rate of 3.1 percent during the 1980s, rapid\npopulation growth effaced these gains and caused an average annual decrease in\nper capita GNP of 0.6 percent. Gross domestic product (GDP—see Glossary) grew\nin real terms by 4.2 percent per year from 1980 to 1985, 1.8 percent from 1985\nto 1988, and 1.5 percent in 1990. In 1991, because of its balance of payments\ndifficulties, the Comoros became eligible for the IDA's Special Program of\nAssistance for debt-distressed countries of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe economy is based on private ownership, frequently by foreign investors.\nNationalization, even during the Soilih years, has been limited. Soilih did\nexpropriate the facilities of a foreign oil company, but only after the\ngovernment of Madagascar took over the company's plants in that country. The\nAbdallah government, despite its openness to foreign participation in the\neconomy, nationalized the Société Bambao and another French-capitalized firm,\nthe Comoran Meat Company (Société Comorienne des Viandes—Socovia), which\nspecialized in sales of meat and other foods in the islands. The\nnationalization was short-lived, however, because Socovia and other\ngovernment-held enterprises were either liquidated or privatized as part of\neconomic restructuring efforts in 1992.\n\nFollowing the Abdallah regime's rapprochement with France in 1978, the Comoran\neconomy became increasingly dependent on infusions of French aid, along with\nassistance from other governments and international organizations. By 1990,\nthe year the Comoros concluded negotiations with the IMF for an economic\nrestructuring program, the republic's total external public debt was US$162.4\nmillion, an amount equal to about three-quarters of GNP. The government\ndelayed implementing the structural adjustment plan and was directed by the\nWorld Bank and the IMF to do so by September 1992. The plan recommendations\nentailed discharging about 2,800 of 9,000 civil servants, among other\nunpopular measures. The IMF granted the Comoros a new credit for US$1.9\nmillion in March 1994 under the Structural Adjustment Facility. For the period\n1994–96, the Comoros sought an economic growth rate of 4 percent as well as an\ninflation rate of 4 percent for 1995–96. The growth rate for 1994, however,\nwas estimated only at 0.7 percent and the inflation rate at 15 percent.\nMeanwhile, in a move designed to encourage private enterprise and reduce\nunemployment, in May 1993 the UN Development Programme had given the Comoros a\ncredit of US$2 million for programs in these areas. In January 1994, the\nEuropean Development Fund (EDF) granted 1.3 million European Currency Units\n(ECUs; for value, see Glossary) to the Comoros to develop small businesses.\nThe Comoros also received 5.7 million French francs from the French Aid and\nCooperation Fund for agriculture and rural development.\n\nThe results of foreign aid to the Comoros have been mixed at best. The\npurposes of the aid ranged from helping the government cover its payroll for\nsuch huge, seemingly endless projects as expanding the seaport at Moroni and\ndeveloping a new port at Mutsamuda on Nzwani. Neither project had shown much\npromise by early 1994. Meanwhile, the islands have been unable to develop\nlocal resources or create the infrastructure needed for economic development.\nThe few successes included the creation of national news media and limited\nimprovements in public health, education, and telecommunications.\nDevelopmental assistance from the United States, which totaled US$700,000 in\nfiscal year (FY—see Glossary) 1991, was administered by CARE, the\nnongovernmental organization, and focused primarily on reforestation, soil\nconservation, and sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe Comoros has officially participated in the African Franc Zone (Communauté\nFinancière Africaine—CFA; see Glossary) since 1979. The CFA franc was qualed\none French franc.\n\nA national labor organization, the Union of Comoran Workers (Union des\nTravailleurs des Comores), also had headquarters in Moroni. Strikes and worker\ndemonstrations often occurred in response to political crises, economic\nrestructuring mandated by international financial organizations, and the\nfailure of the government — occasionally for months at a time — to pay civil\nservants. Mean wages were $0.80 per man-hour in 2009.",

    "text": "Agriculture supported about 80 percent of the population and supplied about 95\npercent of exports in the early 1990s. Two agricultural zones are generally\ndefined: the coastal area, which ranges in elevation from sea level to 400\nmeters and which supports cash crops such as vanilla, ylang-ylang, and cloves;\nand the highlands, which support cultivation of crops for domestic\nconsumption, such as cassava, bananas, rain rice, and sweet potatoes. As the\npopulation increased, food grown for domestic use met fewer and fewer of\nComorans' needs. Data collected by the World Bank showed that food production\nper capita fell about 12 percent from 1980 to 1987. The republic imported\nvirtually all its meat and vegetables; rice imports alone often accounted for\nup to 30 percent of the value of all imports.\n\nCloves ready to be dried\n\nThe Comoros is the world's principal producer of ylang-ylang essence, an\nessence derived from the flowers of a tree originally brought from Indonesia\nthat is used in manufacturing perfumes and soaps. Ylang-ylang essence is a\nmajor component of Chanel No. 5, the popular scent for women. The republic is\nthe world's second largest producer of vanilla, after Madagascar. Cloves are\nalso an important cash crop. A total of 237 tons of vanilla was exported in\n1991, at a price of about CF19 per kilogram. A total of 2,750 tons of cloves\nwas exported in 1991, at a price of CF397 per kilogram. That year forty-three\ntons of ylang-ylang essence were exported at a price of about CF23,000 per\nkilogram. The production of all three commodities fluctuates wildly, mainly in\nresponse to changes in global demand and natural disasters such as cyclones.\nProfits—and therefore, government receipts—likewise skyrocket and plummet,\nwreaking havoc with government efforts to predict revenues and plan\nexpenditures. Stabex (Stabilization of Export Earnings—see Glossary), a system\nof the EC, provides aid to the Comoros and other developing countries to\nmitigate the effects of fluctuations in the prices of export commodities.\n\nLong-term prospects for the growth and stabilization of the markets for\nvanilla and ylang-ylang did not appear strong in the early 1990s. Vanilla\nfaced increased competition from synthetic flavorings, and the preferences of\nperfume users were moving away from the sweet fragrance provided by ylang-\nylang essence. Copra, the dried coconut meat that yields coconut oil, once an\nimportant Comoran export, had ceased to be a significant factor in the economy\nby the late 1980s, when the world's tastes shifted from high-fat coconut oil\ntoward \"leaner\" substances such as palm oil. Although clove production and\nrevenues also experienced swings, in the early 1990s cloves did not appear to\nface the same sorts of challenges confronting vanilla and ylang-ylang. Most\nComoran vanilla is grown on Njazidja; Nzwani is the source of most ylangylang.\n\nNumerous international programs have attempted to reduce the country's\ndependence on food imports, particularly of rice, a major drain on export\nearnings. Organizations initiating these rural development programs have\nincluded the EDF, the IFAD, the World Food Program, the Arab Bank for Economic\nDevelopment in Africa, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and the\ngovernments of France and the United States. Despite these international\nefforts, which numbered as many as seventeen in 1984, food production per\ncapita actually declined in the Comoros during the 1980s. The major clove and\nvanilla growers, whose plantations occupy the islands' fertile coastal lands,\ngenerally resisted these restructuring efforts, as did rice-importing firms,\nincluding the country's largest, Établissements Abdallah et Fils.\n\nCrowded onto the mountain slopes by the cash crop plantations, food-crop\nfarmers have caused deforestation and the erosion of the highlands' thin,\nfragile soil. In response, aid providers have dedicated an increasing amount\nof agricultural assistance to reforestation, soil restoration, and\nenvironmentally sensitive means of cultivation. For example, all United States\nagricultural aid in 1991 (US$700,000) was directed to such projects, as was a\nUS$4 million loan from the IFAD to help initiate a small producers' support\nprogram on Nzwani.\n\nThe livestock sector is small—some 47,000 cattle, 120,000 goats, 13,000 sheep,\nand 4,000 asses in 1990. The Comoros continues to import most domestically\nconsumed meat.",
