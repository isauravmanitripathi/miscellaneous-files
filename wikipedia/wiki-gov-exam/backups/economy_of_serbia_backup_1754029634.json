Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key\nfuels (such as oil and gas).\n\nSerbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas.\nSerbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tons of coal lignite are the 5th\nlargest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany). Coal is found in two\nlarge deposits: Kolubara (4 billion tons of reserves) and Kostolac (1.5\nbillion tons). Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas\nresources (77.4 million tons of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic meters,\nrespectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the\nregion of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania). Almost\n90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in Banat and those oil and\ngas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are\naverage on a European scale.\n\nThe production of electricity in 2018 in Serbia was 38.3 billion kilowatt-\nhours (KWh), while the final electricity consumption amounted to 28.1 billion\nkilowatt-hours (KWh). Most of the electricity produced comes from thermal-\npower plants (71% of all electricity) and to a lesser degree from\nhydroelectric-power plants (24%) and wind energy (3%). There are 6 lignite-\noperated thermal-power plants with an installed power of 3,936 MW; largest of\nwhich are 1,502 MW-Nikola Tesla 1 and 1,160 MW-Nikola Tesla 2, both in\nObrenovac. Total installed power of 9 hydroelectric-power plants is 2,831 MW,\nlargest of which is Đerdap 1 with capacity of 1,026 MW. In addition to this,\nthere are mazute and gas-operated thermal-power plants with an installed power\nof 353 MW. The entire production of electricity is concentrated in\nElektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), public electric-utility power company.\n\nThe current oil production in Serbia amounts to over 1.1 million tons of oil\nequivalent and satisfies some 43% of country's needs while the rest is\nimported. National petrol company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), was\nacquired in 2008 by Gazprom Neft. The company's refinery in Pančevo (capacity\nof 4.8 million tons) is one of the most modern oil-refineries in Europe; it\nalso operates network of 334 filling stations in Serbia (74% of domestic\nmarket) and additional 36 stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 31 in Bulgaria,\nand 28 in Romania. There are 155 kilometers of crude oil pipelines connecting\nPančevo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil\npipeline.\n\nSerbia is heavily dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, with only 17%\ncoming from domestic production (totalling 491 million cubic meters in 2012)\nand the rest is imported, mainly from Russia (via gas pipelines that run\nthrough Ukraine and Hungary). Srbijagas, public company, operates the natural\ngas transportation system which comprise 3,177 kilometers of trunk and\nregional natural gas pipelines and a 450 million cubic meter underground gas\nstorage facility at Banatski Dvor."

Total length\nof roads is 45,419 km of which 915 km are \"class-Ia state roads\" (i.e.\nmotorways); 4,481 km are \"class-Ib state roads\" (national roads); 10,941 km\nare \"class-II state roads\" (regional roads) and 23,780 km are \"municipal\nroads\". The road network, except for the most of class-Ia roads, are of\ncomparatively high quality to the Western European standards because of huge\nfinancial investments Serbias has been seeing in the last 10 years.\n\nOver 300 kilometers of new motorways has been constructed in the last decade\nand additional 142 kilometers are currently under construction: A5 motorway\n(from north of Kruševac to Čačak) and 30 km-long segment of A2 (between Čačak\nand Požega). Coach transport is very extensive: almost every place in the\ncountry is connected by bus, from largest cities to the villages; in addition\nthere are international routes (mainly to countries of Western Europe with\nsmall Serb diaspora). Routes, both domestic and international, are served by\nmore than 100 bus companies, biggest of which are Lasta and Niš-Ekspres. As of\n2018[update], there were 1,959,584 registered passenger cars or 1 passenger\ncar per 3.5 inhabitants.\n\nSerbia has 3,819 kilometers of rail tracks, of which 1,279 are electrified and\n283 kilometers are double-track railroad. The major rail hub is Belgrade (and\nto a lesser degree Niš), while the most important railroads include:\nBelgrade–Bar (Montenegro), Belgrade–Šid–Zagreb (Croatia)/Belgrade–Niš–Sofia\n(Bulgaria) (part of Pan-European Corridor X), Belgrade–Subotica–Budapest\n(Hungary) and Niš–Thessaloniki (Greece). Although still a major mode of\nfreight transportation, railroads face increasing problems with the\nmaintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds. The rail services are\noperated by Srbija Voz (passenger transport) and Srbija Kargo (freight\ntransport).\n\nThere are three airports with regular passenger traffic. Belgrade Nikola Tesla\nAirport served 5.6 million passengers in 2018 and is a hub of flagship carrier\nAir Serbia which carried some 2.5 million passengers in 2018. Niš Constantine\nthe Great Airport is mainly catering low-cost airlines. Morava Airport is\ncurrently only served by Air Serbia.\n\nSerbia has a developed inland water transport since there are 1,716 kilometers\nof navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of\nnavigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the\ncountry. The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-\nEuropean Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and\nTimiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe\nthrough the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Central Europe via\nthe Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the\nSava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian\nrivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad,\nBelgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac."
