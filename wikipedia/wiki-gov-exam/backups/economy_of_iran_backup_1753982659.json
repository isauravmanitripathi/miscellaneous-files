    "text": "| This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( April 2023)_  \n---|---  \n  \nIran has a mixed, centrally planned economy with a large public sector.[_needs\nupdate_] It consists of hydrocarbon, agricultural and service sectors, in\naddition to manufacturing and financial services, with over 40 industries\ntraded on the Tehran Stock Exchange. With 10% of the world's proven oil\nreserves and 15% of its gas reserves, Iran is considered an \"energy\nsuperpower\". Nevertheless, since 2024 Iran is suffering from an energy crisis.\n\nA unique feature of Iran's economy is the reliance on large religious\nfoundations called bonyads, whose combined budgets represent more than 30\npercent of central government spending.\n\nIn 2007, the Iranian subsidy reform plan introduced price controls and\nsubsidies particularly on food and energy. Contraband, administrative\ncontrols, widespread corruption, and other restrictive factors undermine\nprivate sector-led growth. The government's 20-year vision involved market-\nbased reforms reflected in a five-year development plan, 2016 to 2021,\nfocusing on \"a resilient economy\" and \"progress in science and technology\".\nMost of Iran's exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of\ngovernment revenue in 2010. In March 2022, the Iranian parliament under the\nthen new president Ebrahim Raisi decided to eliminate a major subsidy for\nimporting food, medicines and animal feed, valued at $15 billion in 2021. Also\nin March 2022, 20 billion tons of basic goods exports from Russia including\nvegetable oil, wheat, barley and corn were agreed.\n\nIran's educated population, high human development, constrained economy and\ninsufficient foreign and domestic investment prompted an increasing number of\nIranians to seek overseas employment, resulting in a significant \"brain\ndrain\". However, in 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear\nprogram which removed most international sanctions. Consequently, for a short\nperiod, the tourism industry significantly improved and the inflation of the\ncountry was decreased,[_citation needed_] though US withdrawal from the JCPOA\nin 2018 hindered the growth of the economy again and increased\ninflation.[_citation needed_]\n\nGDP contracted in 2018 and 2019, but a modest rebound was expected in 2020.\nChallenges include a COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, US sanctions\nreimposed in mid-2018, increased unemployment due to the sanctions, inflation,\nfood inflation, a \"chronically weak and undercapitalized\" banking system, and\nan \"anemic\" private sector, and corruption.Fact Check: Are Ali Khamenei's\nLiving Standards 'Below Average'? Iran's currency, the Iranian rial, has\nfallen, and Iran has a relatively low rating in \"Economic Freedom\", and \"ease\nof doing business\".",

    "text": "Persian Achaemenid gold coin, circa 490 BC\n\nIn 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was defeated and captured by the Persians, who\nthen adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. There are accounts in the\nbiblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far\nout as India and the Kingdom of Kush during the reign of Xerxes the Great\n(485–465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the\nPersian Empire ran some 2,857 km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250 km\neast of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern İzmir in Turkey) on the\nAegean Sea.\n\nModern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1850s when Amir Kabir undertook a\nnumber of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes\nincluded importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with\nother countries. Polyakov's _Bank Esteqrazi_ was bought in 1898 by the Tsarist\ngovernment of Russia, and later passed into the hands of the Iranian\ngovernment by a contract in 1920. The bank continued its activities under the\nname of _Bank Iran_ until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded Keshavarzi\nBank.\n\nThe Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1885, with offices in all major\ncities of Persia. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–41) improved the country's\noverall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against\nforeign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern\nindustries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change,\neconomic development, and relative political stability.\n\nReza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, Mohammad\nReza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941–79). No fundamental change occurred in the economy\nof Iran during World War II and the years immediately following. Between 1954\nand 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to\ngreater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government\nsector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency,\nthe rial, depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic\npolicies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of\nnominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.\n\nPrior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the\n1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and\nmodernization. The pace slowed by 1978 as capital flight reached $30 to $40\nbillion 1980-US dollars just before the revolution.\n\nFollowing the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War,\nover 80% of the economy came under government control. The eight-year war with\nIraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000. The\ncost of the war to Iran's economy was some $500 billion.\n\nAfter hostilities ceased in 1988, the government tried to develop the\ncountry's communication, transportation, manufacturing, health care, education\nand energy sectors, including its prospective nuclear power facilities, and\nbegan integrating its communication and transportation systems with those of\nneighboring states.\n\nThe government's long-term objectives since the revolution were stated as\neconomic independence, full employment, and a comfortable standard of living\nbut Iran's population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and its median\nage declined. Although many Iranians are farmers, agricultural production has\nconsistently fallen since the 1960s. By the late 1990s, Iran imported much of\nits food. At that time, economic hardship in the countryside resulted in many\npeople moving to cities.\n\n* The Provinces of Iran by their contribution to national GDP, 2014\n\n* Socioeconomic expenditures, 2004\n\n* Historical GDP per capita development in Iran, 1820–2018\n\n* Economic sectors, 2002\n\n* Inflation rate, 1980–2010\n\n* Market liquidity, 2012\n\n* CPI, broad money and foreign exchange reserves, 2000–2011\n\n* US dollar/Iranian rial exchange rate, 2003–2014 est.\n\n* Debt service, 1980–2000\n\n* Balance of payment, 2003–2007\n\n* TEPIX vs DJIA and oil prices, 2000–2009\n\n* Oil production and consumption, 1977–2010\n\n* Oil and gas production, 1970–2030 est.",

By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of\nits GDP to research and development, ranking the country behind the world\naverage of 1.4%. In 2009 the ratio of research to GDP was 0.87% against the\ngovernment's medium-term target of 2.5%. Iran ranked first in scientific\ngrowth in the world in 2011 and 17th in science production in 2012.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nIran has a broad and diversified industrial base. According to _The Economist_\n, Iran ranked 39th in a list of industrialized nations, producing $23 billion\nof industrial products in 2008. Between 2008 and 2009 Iran moved to 28th from\n69th place in annual industrial production growth because of its relative\nisolation from the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the service sector was Iran's largest, followed by\nindustry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture. In 2008, Iran's GDP was\nestimated at $382.3 billion ($842 billion PPP), or $5,470 per capita ($12,800\nPPP).\n\nIn 2010, the nominal GDP was projected to double in the next five years. Real\nGDP growth was expected to average 2.2% a year in 2012–16, insufficient to\nreduce the unemployment rate. Furthermore, international sanctions have\ndamaged the economy by reducing oil exports by half, before recovering in\n2016. The Iranian rial lost more than half of its value in 2012, directing\nIran to import substitution industrialization and a resistive economy.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, Iran is a \"transition economy\",\ni.e., changing from a planned to a market economy.\n\nIn 2008, the United Nations classified Iran's economy as semi-developed. In\n2014, Iran ranked 83rd in the World Economic Forum's analysis of the global\ncompetitiveness of 144 countries. Political, policy and currency stability are\nregarded as the most problematic factors in doing business in Iran. Difficulty\nin accessing financing is also a major concern, especially for small and\nmedium enterprises. Most of Iran's financial resources are directed at\ntrading, smuggling and speculation instead of production and\nmanufacturing.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 2008, according to Goldman Sachs, Iran has the potential to become one of\nthe world's largest economies in the 21st century. In 2014, Iranian President\nHassan Rouhani stated that Iran has the potential to become one of the ten\nlargest economies within the next 30 years.\n\nOne major problem often cited by Iranian industrialists is that the government\nis not supporting them by authorizing imports of similar parts or products\ninto the country, undermining their activity and domestic market. This is\npartly due to corrupt interests inside the government and\nmismanagement.[_citation needed_]\n\n---\nScientific growth in Iran\n\n250\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1,000\n\n1,250\n\n1,500\n\n5,000\n\n10,000\n\n15,000\n\n20,000\n\n2000\n\n2004\n\n2008\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\n* GDP, PPP, million (current international $)\n* GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)\n\nChanges in population of Iran Year\n(Source: IMF) | GDP, current prices\n(billions IRR) | Implied PPP\nconversion rate\n(USD/IRR) | GDP per capita, PPP\n(current international dollar) | Inflation index\n(average CPI)\n(2011/2012=100) | Current account balance\n(billions US dollars) | Population\n(million persons)\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n1980 | 6,622 | 40 | 4,267 | 0.5 | -3.6 | 38\n1985 | 16,556 | 53 | 6,469 | 0.9 | -0.9 | 48\n1990 | 35,315 | 101 | 6,410 | 2.5 | -2.7 | 55\n1995 | 185,928 | 399 | 7,265 | 9 | 3.4 | 64\n2000 | 580,473 | 940 | 9,666 | 21 | 12.5 | 64\n2005 | 1,831,739 | 2,025 | 13,036 | 40 | 15.4 | 69\n2010 | 4,333,088 | 3,498 | 16,664 | 82 | 27.3 | 74\n2015 (est.) | 13,077,142 | 9,788 | 16,918 | 253 | 6.9 | 79",

Iran's investment reached 27.7% of GDP in 2009. Between 2002\nand 2006, inflation fluctuated around 14%.\n\nIn 2008, around 55% of government revenue came from oil and natural gas\nrevenue, with 31% from taxes and fees. There are virtually millions of people\nwho do not pay taxes in Iran and hence operate outside the formal economy. The\nbudget for year 2012 was $462 billion, 9% less than 2011. The budget is based\non an oil price of $85 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at\nIRR 12,260 for the same period.\n\nAccording to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of\nbudgeting were observed the government could save at least 30 to 35% on its\nexpenses. The central bank's interest rate is 21%, and the inflation rate has\nclimbed to 22% in 2012, 10% higher than in 2011. There is little alignment\nbetween fiscal and monetary policy. According to the Central Bank of Iran, the\ngap between the rich and the poor narrowed because of monthly subsidies but\nthe trend could reverse if high inflation persists.\n\nIran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011 and balances\nits external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel. As of\n2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of\ncurrent sanctions. Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran's\ngovernment non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of\nthe latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a\nconsequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December\n2011 and April 2012.\n\nIran's external and fiscal accounts reflect falling oil prices in FY 2012, but\nremain in surplus. The current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1%\nof GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran's\nNational Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. In 2013 the\nexternal debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012. Overall\nfiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7%\nin 2015.\n\nMoney in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017\npre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian\nrial and rise in inflation.",

Sale\nof state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a\nnationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006, most industries, some 70% of\nthe economy, remained state-owned. The majority of heavy industries including\nsteel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the\npublic sector, with most light industry privately owned.\n\nArticle 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country's economy\nshould consist of state, cooperative, and private based sectors. The state\nsector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals,\nbanking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation\nnetworks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services,\naviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned\nand administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned\nwith production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of\nthe cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law.

Private sector operate in construction,\nagriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement\nthe economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors.\n\nSince Article 44 has never been strictly enforced, the private sector has\nplayed a much larger role than that outlined in the constitution. In recent\nyears, the role of this sector has increased. A 2004 constitutional amendment\nallows 80% of state assets to be privatized. Forty percent of such sales are\nto be conducted through the \"Justice Shares\" scheme and the rest through the\nTehran Stock Exchange. The government would retain the remaining 20%.\n\nIn 2005, government assets were estimated at $120 billion.

It supervises 1200, out of 2500 Islamic loan\nfunds, on behalf of Iran's Central Bank. Several commercial banks have\nbranches throughout the country. Two development banks exist and a housing\nbank specializes in home mortgages. The government began to privatize the\nbanking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned\nbanks.\n\nState-owned commercial banks predominantly make loans to the state, _bonyad_\nenterprises, large-scale private firms and four thousand wealthy/connected\nindividuals.

Although the United States has consistently blocked its bid to join the\norganization, observer status came in a goodwill gesture to ease nuclear\nnegotiations between Iran and the international community. With exports of 60\nproducts with revealed comparative advantage, Iran is the 65th \"most complex\ncountry\".\n\nShould Iran eventually gain membership status in the WTO, among other\nprerequisites, copyrights will have to be enforced in the country. This will\nrequire a major overhaul. The country is hoping to attract billions of\ndollars' worth of foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment\nclimate through freer trade. Free trade zones such as Qeshm, Chabahar, and\nKish Island are expected to assist in this process. Iran allocated $20 billion\nin 2010 to loans for the launch of twenty trade centers in other countries."

    "text": "See also Economic Recession in Iran\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and\ndiplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately\n$11 billion of its assets. In 1996, the U.S. Government passed the Iran and\nLibya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which prohibits U.S. (and non-U.S.) companies from\ninvesting and trading with Iran in amounts of more than $20 million annually.\nSince 2000 exceptions to this restriction have been made for items including\npharmaceuticals and medical equipment.\n\nIran's nuclear program has been the subject of contention with the West since\n2006 over suspicions of its intentions. The UN Security Council imposed\nsanctions against select companies linked to the nuclear program, thus\nfurthering the country's economic isolation. Sanctions notably bar nuclear,\nmissile and many military exports to Iran and target investments in oil, gas\nand petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, as well as the\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banks, insurance, financial transactions\nand shipping.\n\nIn 2012, the European Union tightened its own sanctions by joining the three\ndecade-old US oil embargo against Iran. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a\ndeal on the nuclear program that will remove the main sanctions by early 2016.\nEven though Iran can trade in its own currency some problems subsist mainly\ndue to the fact that it cannot transact in US dollars freely. Given its large\nreserves of oil and gas, the Iranian rial could become a world reserve\ncurrency if parity is established with oil and gas.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 2018, the United States government unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA\nagreement and re-imposed its sanctions on Iran's oil sales, petrochemicals,\nshipping, metals trading and banking transactions."

    "text": "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action allows Iran to purchase new planes.\n\nAccording to U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns, Iran may be losing\nas much as $60 billion annually in energy investment. Sanctions are making\nimports 24% more costly on average. In addition, the latest round of sanctions\ncould cost Iran annually $50 billion in lost oil revenues. Iran is\nincreasingly using barter trade because its access to the international dollar\npayment system has been denied. According to Iranian officials, large-scale\nwithdrawal by international companies represents an \"opportunity\" for domestic\ncompanies to replace them.\n\nThe IEA estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000 bpd in\nSeptember 2012 from 2.2 million bpd at the end of 2011. This fall led to a\ndrop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency,\nthe rial, collapsed. September 2012 output was Iran's lowest since 1988.\n\nThe economic impacts of sanctions have been severe. Based on research, the\nsanctions resulted in welfare losses across all income groups in Iran, with\nwealthier groups suffering greater losses compared to poorer groups.\nAdditionally, income concentration and share within top income groups declined\npost-sanctions.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by\n10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008\nworld oil price of $100/bbl).\n\nAccording to NIAC, sanctions cost the United States over $175 billion in lost\ntrade and 279,000 lost job opportunities. Between 2010 and 2012, sanctions\ncost the E.U. states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of\nlost trade revenue. Germany was hit the hardest, losing between $23.1 and\n$73.0 billion between 2010 and 2012, with Italy and France following at\n$13.6-$42.8 billion and $10.9-$34.2 billion respectively.\n\nGDP growth turned negative in 2013 (−5%). The unofficial unemployment rate was\n20% by mid-2012. Oil exports dropped to 1.4 million bpd in 2014 from 2.5\nmillion bpd in 2011. By 2013, Iran had $80 billion in foreign exchange\nreserves frozen overseas. Automobile production declined 40% between 2011 and\n2013. According to the U.S. government in 2015, Iran's economy has reached a\npoint where it is \"fundamentally incapable of recovery\" without a nuclear\naccommodation with the West.\n\n> The tentative rapprochement between Iran and the US, which began in the\n> second half of 2013, has the potential to become a world-changing\n> development, and unleash tremendous geopolitical and economic opportunities,\n> if it is sustained […] if Iran and the US were to achieve a diplomatic\n> breakthrough, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could decline\n> sharply, and Iran could come to be perceived as a promising emerging market\n> in its own right.\n\nIn January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the US for Iran's declining\neconomy. Following the US pullout from an international nuclear deal with Iran\nand re-imposed sanctions, Iran faced the toughest economic situation in 40\nyears. According to Majlis, this has caused damages estimated between 150 and\n200 billion dollars to the Iranian economy.\n\nIn August 2024, an Iranian group called IRLeaks attacked Iranian banks.\nPolitico described the attack as the \"worst cyberattack\" in Iranian history.\nAccording to Politico, the Iranian government was forced to pay millions of\ndollars to IRLeaks in ransom. Politico reported that 20 out of about 29\nIranian credit institutions fell in the attack. The Iranian supreme leader\nblamed Israel and the United States without mentioning the cyberattack on the\nbanking system. Politico remarked it was plausible Israel or the US were\ninvolved because of tensions with Israel as well as the Americans having\naccused Iran of intervening in the American 2024 elections. Politico also\nremarked that the group was made of freelance hackers and the attack was\nlikely carried out for monetary gain. TechCentral said the attack was probably\ncarried out by freelance hackers. An Iranian firm paid the hackers no less\nthan $3 million to IRLeaks to stop the attack and retrieve data."
