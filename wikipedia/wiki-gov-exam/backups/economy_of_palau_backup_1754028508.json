The government is the major employer of the work force, relying\nheavily on financial assistance from the United States. The population enjoys\na per capita income of more than twice that of the Philippines and much of\nMicronesia. Long-term prospects for the tourist sector have been greatly\nbolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the rising\nprosperity of leading East Asian countries.\n\nPalau's per capita GDP of $17,000 makes it one of the wealthier Pacific Island\nstates. Nominal GDP increased by an annual average of nearly 14% from 1983 to\n1990, and by an annual rate of over 10% from 1991 to 1997. Growth turned\nsharply negative in 1998 and 1999 as a result of the 1997 Asian financial\ncrisis.",

    "text": "Tourism is Palau's main industry. Activity focuses on scuba diving and\nsnorkeling among the islands' rich marine environment, including the Floating\nGarden Islands to the west of Koror. Major scuba diving sites include German\nChannel and Blue Corner. The number of visitors—85% of whom come from Japan,\nTaiwan, and the U.S.—reached nearly 67,000 in 1997, more than quadruple the\nlevel of a decade earlier. Tourism earned $67 million in foreign exchange for\nPalau in 1996, (which is 1,000 dollars per person) accounting for roughly half\nof GDP. Arrivals from Asian countries dropped in 1998 and 1999 due to the\nregional economic downturn and the depreciation of many Asian currencies\nagainst the dollar, which made Palau's dollar-denominated prices more\nexpensive.\n\nThe service sector dominates the Palauan economy, contributing more than 80%\nof GDP and employing three-quarters of the work force. The government alone\nemploys nearly 30% of workers. One of the government's main responsibilities\nis administering external assistance. Under the terms of the Compact of Free\nAssociation with the United States, Palau will receive more than $450 million\nin assistance over 15 years, $30 million per year, and is eligible to\nparticipate in more than 40 federal programs. The first grant of $142 million\nwas made in 1994. Further annual payments in lesser amounts will be made\nthrough 2009. U.S. grants in 1999 totaled $24 million.\n\nConstruction is the most important industrial activity, contributing over 9%\nof GDP. Several large infrastructure projects, including the rebuilding of the\nbridge connecting Koror and Babeldaob Islands after its collapse in 1996 and\nthe construction of a highway around the rim of Babeldaob, boosted activity at\nthe end of the 1990s.\n\nAgriculture is mainly on a subsistence level, the principal crops being\ncoconuts, root crops, and bananas. Fishing is a potential source of revenue,\nbut the islands' tuna output dropped by over one-third during the 1990s.\n\nThere are no Patent Laws in Palau.
