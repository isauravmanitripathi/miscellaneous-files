    "text": "The economic activity of the Federated States of Micronesia consists primarily\nof subsistence agriculture and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits\nworth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist\nindustry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate\nfacilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the primary\nsource of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in\n1986–2001. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are\nmajor impediments to long-term growth.\n\nUnder the terms of the Compact of Free Association, the United States provided\nFSM with around $2 billion in grants and services from 1986 to 2001. The\nCompact's financial terms are being renegotiated for an extension period. In\n2001 the U.S. provided more than $84 million in Compact grants—an amount\nequivalent to over one-third of FSM's GDP—plus more than $20 million through\nother federal programs. Total official development assistance from all sources\nwas more than $100 million in 2001, with nearly 90% of that total coming from\nthe U.S.\n\nThe FSM public sector plays a central role in the economy as the administrator\nof the Compact money. The national and state-level governments employ over\none-half of the country's workers and provide services accounting for more\nthan 40% of GDP. Faced with the potential decrease or cessation of some of the\nassistance programs upon the Compact's financial provisions' expiry in 2001,\nthe Government of the FSM in 1996 began to implement a program of economic\nreforms designed to reduce the role of the public sector in the economy. In\naddition, the advent of music startups using .fm domain names has provided a\nnew, albeit fairly small, stream of revenue to the government."

    "text": "The fishing industry is highly important. Foreign commercial fishing fleets\npay over $20 million annually for the right to operate in FSM territorial\nwaters. These licensing fees account for nearly 30% of domestic budgetary\nrevenue. Additionally, exports of marine products, mainly reexports of fish to\nJapan, account for nearly 85% of export revenue.\n\nThe tourist industry is present but has been hampered by a lack of\ninfrastructure. Visitor attractions include scuba diving in each state, World\nWar II battle sites, and the ancient ruined city of Nan Madol on Pohnpei. Some\n15,000 tourists visit the islands each year. The Asian Development Bank has\nidentified tourism as one of FSM's highest potential growth industries.\n\nFarming is mainly subsistence, and its importance is declining. The principal\ncrops are coconuts, bananas, betel nuts, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Less\nthan 10% of the formal labor force and less than 7% of export revenue come\nfrom the agriculture sector. Manufacturing activity is modest, consisting\nmainly of the export of betel nut in Yap and production of buttons from\ntrochus shells."

    "text": "The large inflow of official assistance to FSM allows it to run a substantial\ntrade deficit and to have a much lighter tax burden than other states in the\nregion (11% of GDP in FSM compared to 18–25% elsewhere). The government also\nborrowed against future Compact disbursements in the early 1990s, yielding an\nexternal debt of $111 million in 1997 (over 50% of GDP).\n\nThere are no patent laws in Micronesia."
