Until the 1980s, many of Austria's\nlargest industry firms were nationalised. In recent years, privatisation has\nreduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.\nAmong OECD nations, Austria has a highly efficient and strong social security\nsystem; social expenditure stood at roughly 29.4% of GDP.\n\nLabor movements are particularly strong in Austria, and they have a large\ninfluence on labor politics. Next to a highly developed industry,\ninternational tourism is the most important part of the national economy. The\neconomy of Austria's average GDP is 13th growth in OECD countries, from 1992\nto 2017. In Austria, 1.37% over average population growth is the strong\nfactor.\n\nGermany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making the\nAustrian economy vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However,\nsince Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained\ncloser ties to other European Union economies. This development reduced its\neconomic dependence on Germany. In addition, Austria's membership in the EU\nhas drawn an influx of foreign investors.\n\nThey were attracted by Austria's access to the European Single Market and the\ncountry's proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in\nGDP has accelerated in recent years, and reached 3.3% in 2006.\n\nIn 2024 Austria has a very high, $58,669 nominal GDP per capita ranked 13th.\n\nVienna was ranked the fifth richest NUTS-2 region within Europe (see Economy\nof the European Union), with its GDP reaching €38,632 per capita. It was\ntrailing behind Inner London, Luxembourg, the Brussels-Capital Region and\nHamburg.\n\nGrowth had been steady between 2002 and 2006, varying between 1 and 3.3%.\nAfter hitting 0% in 2013, growth had picked up a little. As of 2016, growth\nwas set at 1.5%.",

The\nLeague scheme was based on the view that Austrian troubles as a result of an\ninability to pay for necessities and obtain credit, and therefore, an Austrian\nfinancial revival was critical to Austrian survival. To this end, the plan was\nfocused solely on financial reconstruction. Austria would receive loans raised\nfrom international money markets and the Austrian public, which would be\nsecured on customs and tobacco taxes. In exchange, Austria would in effect\nlose sovereignty over its economy, agreeing to:\n\n* Relinquish control over the mints to an independent bank, with the aim of returning to the gold standard.\n* Terminate the printing of money by the central bank.\n* Eliminate the budget deficit (requiring the implementation of austerity measures and monetary control).\n\nThe measures took effect in 1923. Short-term effects were impressive; during\nthe announcement to undertake Austrian reconstruction in August 1922, public\nconfidence soared. Foreign currency holdings were converted back into krone,\nstabilising the currency. This allowed the Austrian Foreign Exchange Agency to\nfinally intervene to fix the krone to the dollar, something that the wild\ngyrations of the past had not permitted. Capital rushed back into Austria, and\ndomestic prices stabilised, pronouncing the end of hyperinflation.\n\nThe steam ran out shortly after implementation. Growth averaged 0.35% per\nannum until 1929, unemployment leapt five-fold, bankruptcies increased\n41-fold, and the trade deficit doubled.",
