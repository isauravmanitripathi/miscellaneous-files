Costa Rica's economy\nemerged from recession in 1997 and has shown strong aggregate growth since\nthen. The estimated GDP for 2023 is US$90 billion, up significantly from the\nUS$52.6 billion in 2015 while the estimated 2024 per capita (purchasing power\nparity) is US$28,558.\n\nInflation remained around 4% to 5% per annum for several years up to 2015 but\nthen dropped to 0.7% in 2016; it was expected to rise to a still moderate 2.8%\nby the end of 2017 In 2017, Costa Rica had the highest standards of living in\nCentral America in spite of the high poverty level. The poverty level dropped\nby 1.2% in 2017 to 20.5%, thanks to reducing inflation and benefits offered by\nthe government. The estimated unemployment level in 2017 was 8.1%, roughly the\nsame as in 2016.\n\nThe country has evolved from an economy that once depended solely on\nagriculture, to one that is more diverse, based on tourism, electronics and\nmedical components exports, medical manufacturing and IT services. Corporate\nservices for foreign companies employ some 3% of the workforce. Of the GDP,\n5.5% is generated by agriculture, 18.6% by industry and 75.9% by services\n(2016). Agriculture employs 12.9% of the labor force, industry 18.57%,\nservices 69.02% (2016) Many foreign companies operate in the various Free-\ntrade zones. In 2015, exports totalled US$12.6 billion while imports totalled\nUS$15 billion for a trade deficit of US$2.39 billion.\n\nThe growing debt and budget deficit are the country's primary concerns. By\nAugust 2017, Costa Rica was having difficulty paying its obligations and the\nPresident promised dramatic changes to handle the \"liquidity crisis\". Other\nchallenges face Costa Rica in its attempts to increase the economy by foreign\ninvestment. They include a poor infrastructure and a need to improve public\nsector efficiency.",

The total debt in 2015\nwas $22.648 billion, up by nearly $3 billion from 2014. On a per capita basis,\nthe debt was $4,711 per person. Costa Rica had a formal line of credit with\nthe World Bank valued at US$947 million in April 2014, of which US$645 million\nhad been accessed and US$600 million remained outstanding.\n\nIn a June 2017 report, the International Monetary Fund stated that annual\ngrowth was just over 4% with moderate inflation. The report added that\n\"financial system appears sound, and credit growth continues to be consistent\nwith healthy financial deepening and macroeconomic trends. The agency noted\nthat the fiscal deficit remains high and public debt continues to rise rapidly\ndespite the authorities’ deepened consolidation efforts in 2016. Recent\nadvances in fiscal consolidation have been partly reversed and political\nconsensus on a comprehensive fiscal package remains elusive\".\n\nThe IMF also expressed concern about increasing deficits, public debt and the\nheavy dollarization of bank assets and liabilities, warning that in tighter-\nthan-expected global financial conditions these aspects would \"seriously\nundermine investor confidence\". The group also recommended taking steps to\nreduce pension benefits and increase the amount of contribution by the public\nand increasing the cost effectiveness of the education system.\n\nThe country's credit rating was reduced by Moody's Investors Service in early\n2017 to Ba2 from Ba1, with a negative outlook on the rating. The agency\nparticularly cited the \"rising government debt burden and persistently high\nfiscal deficit, which was 5.2% of GDP in 2016\". Moody's was also concerned\nabout the \"lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the\nfiscal deficit [which] will result in further pressure on the government's\ndebt ratios\". In late July 2017, the Central Bank estimated the budget deficit\nat 6.1 percent of the country's GDP. A 2017 study by the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt\nmust be a very high priority for the government. Other fiscal reforms were\nalso recommended to moderate the budget deficit.\n\nIn 2014, President Solís presented a budget with an increase in spending of\n19% for 2015, an increase of 0.5% for 2016 and an increase of 12% for 2017.\nWhen the 2017 budget was finally proposed, it totaled US$15.9 billion. Debt\npayments account for one-third of that amount. Of greater concern is the fact\nthat a full 46% of the budget will require financing, a step that will\nincrease the debt owed to foreign entities.

    "text": "Intel microprocessor facility in Costa Rica\n\nMere decades ago, Costa Rica was known principally as a producer of bananas\nand coffee. Even though bananas, pineapple, sugar, coffee, lumber, wood\nproducts and beef are still important exports, in recent times medical\ninstruments, electronics, pharmaceuticals, financial outsourcing, software\ndevelopment, and ecotourism are now the prime exports. High levels of\neducation and fluency in English among its residents make the country an\nattractive investing location.\n\nIn 2015 the following were the major export products (US$): medical\ninstruments ($2 billion), bananas ($1.24B), tropical fruits ($1.22B),\nintegrated circuits ($841 million) and orthopedic appliances ($555M). The\ntotal exports in 2015 were US$12.6 billion, down from $18.9B in 2010; bananas\nand medical instruments were the two largest sectors. Total imports in 2015\nwere $15B, up from $13.8B in 2010; this resulted in a trade deficit.\n\nOver the years, Costa Rica successfully attracted important investments by\nsuch companies as Intel Corporation, Procter & Gamble, Abbott Laboratories and\nBaxter Healthcare. Manufacturing and industry's contribution to GDP overtook\nagriculture over the course of the 1990s, led by foreign investment in Costa\nRica's Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where companies benefit from investment and tax\nincentives. Companies in such zones must export at least 50% of their\nservices. Well over half of that type of investment has come from the U.S.\nAccording to the government, the zones supported over 82 thousand direct jobs\nand 43 thousand indirect jobs in 2015; direct employment grew 5% over 2014.\nThe average wages in the FTZ increased by 7% and were 1.8 times greater than\nthe average for private enterprise work in the rest of the country. Companies\nwith facilities in the America Free Zone in Heredia, for example, include\nDell, HP, Bayer, Bosch, DHL, IBM and Okay Industries.\n\nIn 2006 Intel's microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa\nRican exports and 4.9% of the country's GDP. In 2014, Intel announced it would\nend manufacturing in Costa Rica and lay off 1,500 staff but agreed to maintain\nat least 1,200 employees. The facility continued as a test and design center\nwith approximately 1,600 remaining staff. In 2017, Intel had 2000 employees in\nthe country, and was operating a facility which assembles, tests and\ndistributes processors and a Global Innovation Center, both in Heredia.\n\nThe fastest growing aspect of the economy is the provision of corporate\nservices for foreign companies which in 2016 employed approximately 54,000\npeople in a country with a workforce under 342,000; that was up from 52,400\nthe previous year. For example, Amazon.com employs some 5,000 people. Many\nwork in the free-trade areas such as Zona Franca America and earn roughly\ndouble the national average for service work. This sector generated US$4.6\nbillion in 2016, nearly as much as tourism.\n\nIn 2013, the total FDI stock in Costa Rica amounted to about 40 percent of\nGDP, of which investments from the United States accounted for 64 percent,\nfollowed by the United Kingdom and Spain with 6 percent each. Costa Rica's\noutward foreign direct investment stock is small, at about 3 percent of GDP as\nof 2011, and mainly concentrated in Central America (about 57 percent of the\ntotal outward direct investment stock).\n\nTourism is an important part of the economy, with the number of visitors\nincreasing from 780,000 in 1996, to 1 million in 1999, and to 2.089 million\nforeign visitors in 2008, allowing the country to earn $2.144-billion in that\nyear. By 2016, 2.6 million tourists visited Costa Rica, spending roughly\nUS$3.4 billion. Tourism directly supported 110,000 jobs and indirectly\nsupported 271,000 in 2016.\n\nCosta Rica has not discovered sources of fossil fuels—apart from minor coal\ndeposits—but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the\nconstruction of a dozen hydroelectric power plants, making it self-sufficient\nin all energy needs, except for refined petroleum. In 2017, Costa Rica was\nconsidering the export of electricity to neighbouring countries. Mild climate\nand trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in\nthe highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.\nRenewable energy in Costa Rica is the norm. In 2016, 98.1 per cent of the\ncountry's electricity came from green sources: hydro generating stations,\ngeothermal plants, wind turbines, solar panels and biomass plants."

    "text": "Costa Rica's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new\ninvestment. The country has an extensive road system of more than 30,000\nkilometers, although much of it is in disrepair; this also applies to ports,\nrailways and water delivery systems. According to a 2016 U.S. government\nreport, investment from China which attempted to improve the infrastructure\nfound the \"projects stalled by bureaucratic and legal concerns\".\n\nMost parts of the country are accessible by road. The main highland cities in\nthe country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts and by the Pan American Highway with Nicaragua and\nPanama, the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's\nports are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient\ncapacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't\nfunction for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it\nfor city transportation. An August 2016 OECD report provided this summary:\n\"The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair\nand only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s,\nseaports quality and capacity are deficient. Internal transportation overly\nrelies on private road vehicles as the public transport system, especially\nrailways, is inadequate.\"\n\nIn a June 2017 interview, President Luis Guillermo Solís said that private\nsector investment would be required to solve the problems. \"Of course Costa\nRica’s infrastructure deficit is a challenge that outlasts any one government\nand I hope that we have created the foundations for future administrations to\ncontinue building. I have just enacted a law to facilitate Public Private\nPartnerships, which are the ideal way to develop projects that are too large\nfor the government to undertake. For example the new airport that we are\nbuilding to serve the capital city will cost $2 billion, so it will need\nprivate-sector involvement. There is also the potential for a ‘dry canal’\nlinking sea ports on our Atlantic and Caribbean Coasts that could need up to\n$16 billion of investment.\"\n\nThe government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management\ninto the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies\nof the state. ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad) has the monopoly\non telecommunications, internet and electricity services. Some limited\ncompetition is allowed. In 2011, two new private companies began offering\ncellular phone service and others offer voice communication over internet\nconnections (VOIP) for overseas calls.\n\nAccording to transparency.org, Costa Rica had a reputation as one of the most\nstable, prosperous, and among the least corrupt in Latin America in 2007.\nHowever, in fall 2004, three former Costa Rican presidents, José María\nFigueres, Miguel Angel Rodríguez, and Rafael Angel Calderon, were investigated\non corruption charges related to the issuance of government contracts. After\nextensive legal proceedings Calderon and Rodriguez were sentenced; however,\nthe inquiry on Figueres was dismissed and he was not charged.\n\nMore recently, Costa Rica reached 40th place in 2015, with a score of 55 on\nthe Perception of Corruption scale; this is better than the global average.\nCountries with the lowest perceived corruption rated 90 on the scale. In late\nMay 2017, the country Costa Rica applied to become a member of the OECD Anti-\nBribery Convention, to be effective in July 2017."

Costa Rica also is a member of the Cairns Group, an\norganization of agricultural exporting countries that are seeking access to\nmore markets to increase the exports of agricultural products. Opponents of\nfree agricultural trade have sometimes attempted to block imports of products\nalready grown in Costa Rica, including rice, potatoes, and onions. By 2015,\nCosta Rica's agricultural exports totalled US$2.7 billion.\n\nIn 2015, the top export destinations for all types of products were the United\nStates (US$4.29 billion), Guatemala ($587 million), the Netherlands ($537\nmillion), Panama ($535 million) and Nicaragua ($496 million). The top import\norigins were the United States ($6.06 billion), China ($1.92 billion), Mexico\n($1.14 billion), Japan ($410 million) and Guatemala ($409 million). The most\nsignificant products imported were Refined Petroleum (8.41% of the total\nimports) and Automobiles (4.68%). Total imports in 2015 were US$15 billion,\nsomewhat higher than the total exports of a US$12.6 billion, for a negative\ntrade balance of US$2.39 billion."

    "text": "The Costa Rican government has and is “actively courting FDI” in order to help\ndevelop its economy. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a form of investment\nthat promotes development in key industries such as manufacturing, medicine,\nand tourism. FDI's influence provides a very lucrative opportunity for foreign\ninvestors which is what continues to attract such large investments year over\nyear. Over time FDI inflows in Costa Rica have increased, Net FDI inflow\naveraged forty four million dollars per year from 1970 to 1979 and just ten\nyears later this value rose to four hundred and sixteen million dollars. The\n2022 data show that Costa Rica received $3 billion in FDI which accounted for\n4.45% of their total GDP.\n\nGrowth in FDI is linked to rising tourist arrivals with the numbers rising\nfrom 2.1 million in 2011 to 3.1 million in 2019. Facilitation of FDI growth is\nseen as an essential role of the Costa Rican government. Throughout 2019 and\n2022, the government of Costa Rica was able to court investment for a total of\n16 new FDI projects with one of the more notable projects being a luxury hotel\nnamed One and Only Papagayo."
