    "text": "In 2000, Zimbabwe launched a controversial land reform that, over the next\ndecade, would seize about 6,000 large, white-owned farms and convert them into\nover 168,000 black-owned farms. Many of the new occupants, mainly consisting\nof landless black citizens and several prominent members of the ruling ZANU-PF\nadministration, were inexperienced or uninterested in farming, thereby failing\nto retain the labour-intensive, highly efficient management of previous\nlandowners, triggering severe export losses.\n\nThis policy of widespread seizure of private land and property spooked\ninternational investors and negatively affected market confidence. The US and\nother nations slapped sanctions on government officials due to the human\nrights abuses attributable to the land reform. Many sanctions continue to this\nday.\n\nIn this time, between 1999–2008, Zimbabwe's GDP shrunk by nearly half — the\nmost severe downturn in a country not at war in recorded history.",

    "text": "Between 2003–2006, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began printing money at an\nextreme rate, causing inflation to spike by a factor of 1,000. By the middle\nof 2008, Zimbabwe hit a breaking point. Inflation hit 89.7 sextillion percent\n— a $100 trillion bill didn't even cover a bus fare.\n\nShortly afterwards, the government introduced a multi-currency system, making\nU.S. dollars, and other currencies legal tender. The Zimbabwe dollar, now\nnearly worthless, disappeared from circulation.\n\nAfter a period of relative economic stability, the government reintroduced\nlocal currency again in 2019, and quickly faced challenges in maintaining its\nvalue. At the time of its reintroduction, one loaf of bread cost between 2 and\n3 Zimbabwean dollars. By 2024, the price had risen to 24,000 Zimbabwean\ndollars, roughly equivalent to 1 United States dollar. Although the U.S.\ndollar remains officially tolerated, many vendors are reluctant to accept\npayments in local currency due to its instability.\n\nIn April 2024, the government launched a new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), to\nreplace the Zimbabwean dollar. Backed by the country's reserves of foreign\ncurrency and precious metals, primarily gold, the new currency aimed to curb\ninflation by preventing excessive money printing and to restore price\nstability."

By 2008, an unofficial estimate of unemployment had risen to 94%.\n\nAs of 2023, Zimbabwe's official unemployment rate stood at 9.3%, though the\nvast majority of workers are in the informal sector, made up of low-paying,\ntemporary and precarious jobs.\n\nA 2014 report by the Africa Progress Panel found that, of all the African\ncountries examined when determining how many years it would take to double per\ncapita GDP, Zimbabwe fared the worst, and that at its current rate of\ndevelopment it would take 190 years for the country to double its per capita\nGDP. Uncertainty around the indigenisation programme (compulsory acquisition),\nthe perceived lack of a free press, the possibility of abandoning the US\ndollar as official currency, and political uncertainty following the end of\nthe government of national unity with the MDC as well as power struggles\nwithin ZANU-PF have increased concerns that the country's economic situation\ncould further deteriorate.\n\nIn September 2016 the finance minister identified \"low levels of production\nand the attendant trade gap, insignificant foreign direct investment and lack\nof access to international finance due to huge arrears\" as significant causes\nfor the poor performance of the economy.\n\nZimbabwe came 140 out of 190 ease of doing business report released by the\nWorld Bank Group.

    "text": "Agriculture in Zimbabwe can be divided into two parts: commercial farming of\ncrops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, peanuts and various fruits, and\nsubsistence farming with staple crops, such as maize or wheat.\n\nCommercial farming was almost exclusively in the hands of the white minority\nuntil the controversial land redistribution program began in 2000. Land in\nZimbabwe was forcibly seized from white farmers and redistributed to black\nsettlers, justified by Mugabe on the grounds that it was meant to rectify\ninequalities left over from colonialism. The new owners did not have land\ntitles, and as such did not have the collateral necessary to access bank\nloans. The small-scale farmers also did not have experience with commercial-\nscale agriculture.\n\nAfter land redistribution, much of Zimbabwe's land went fallow, and\nagricultural production decreased steeply. The University of Zimbabwe\nestimated in 2008 that between 2000 and 2007 agricultural production decreased\nby 51%. Production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's main export crop, decreased by 79%\nfrom 2000 to 2008.\n\nTobacco production recovered after 2008 thanks to the contract system of\nagriculture and growing Chinese demand. International tobacco companies, such\nas British American Tobacco and China Tobacco, supplied farmers with\nagricultural inputs, equipment, and loans, and supervised them in growing\ntobacco. By 2018, tobacco production had recovered to 258 million kg, the\nsecond largest crop on record. Instead of large white-owned farms selling\nmostly to European and American companies, Zimbabwe's tobacco sector now\nconsists of small black-owned farms exporting over half of the crop to China.\nTobacco farming accounted for 11% of Zimbabwe's GDP in 2017, and 3 million of\nits 16 million people depended on tobacco for their livelihood.\n\nLand reform has found considerable support in Africa and a few supporters\namong African-American activists, but Jesse Jackson commented during a visit\nto South Africa in June 2006, \"Land redistribution has long been a noble goal\nto achieve but it has to be done in a way that minimises trauma. The process\nhas to attract investors rather than scare them away. What is required in\nZimbabwe is democratic rule, democracy is lacking in the country and that is\nthe major cause of this economic meltdown.\"\n\nZimbabwe produced, in 2018:\n\n* 3,3 million tons of sugarcane;\n* 730 thousand tons of maize;\n* 256 thousand tons of cassava;\n* 191 thousand tons of vegetable;\n* 132 thousand tons of tobacco (6th largest producer in the world);\n* 106 thousand tons of banana;\n* 96 thousand tons of orange;\n* 90 thousand tons of soy;\n* 80 thousand tons of sorghum;\n* 60 thousand tons of potato;\n* 55 thousand tons of barley;\n* 42 thousand tons of peanut;\n* 38 thousand tons of cotton;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products."

It began\nwith the crash of the stock market on November 14, 1997. Civil society groups\nbegan to agitate for their rights as these had been eroded under ESAP. In 1997\nalone, 232 strikes were recorded, the largest number in any year since\nindependence (Kanyenze 2004). During the first half of 1997, the war veterans\norganized themselves and demonstrations that were initially ignored by the\ngovernment. As the intensity of the strikes grew, the government was forced to\npay the war veterans a once-off gratuity of ZWD $50,000 by December 31, 1997,\nand a monthly pension of US$2,000 beginning January 1998 (Kanyenze 2004). To\nraise money for this unbudgeted expense, the government tried to introduce a\n‘war veterans’ levy,’ but they faced much opposition from the labor force and\nhad to effectively borrow money to meet these obligations. Following the\nmassive depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar in 1997, the cost of\nagricultural inputs soared, undermining the viability of the producers who in\nturn demanded that the producer price of maize (corn) be raised. Millers then\nhiked prices by 24 percent in January 1998 by 24 percent and the consequent\nincrease in the price of maize meal triggered nation-wide riots during the\nlast month. The government intervened by introducing price controls on all\nbasic commodities (Kanyenze 2004). Multiple interventionist moves were\nundertaken to try to reverse some of the negative effects of the Structural\nAdjustment Programs and to try to strengthen the private sector that was\nsuffering from decreasing output and increasing competition from cheap\nimported products. Some of the most detrimental policies that followed\ninclude:"

Roughly 95 percent of transactions used the\nZimbabwean dollar. Following the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979,\nthe transition to majority rule in early 1980, and the lifting of sanctions,\nZimbabwe enjoyed a brisk economic recovery. Real growth for 1980–1981 exceeded\n20%. However, depressed foreign demand for the country's mineral exports and\nthe onset of a drought cut sharply into the growth rate in 1982, 1983, and\n1984. In 1985, the economy rebounded strongly due to a 30% jump in\nagricultural production. However, it slumped in 1986 to a zero growth rate and\nregistered a negative of about 3% in 1987, primarily because of drought and\nthe foreign exchange crisis faced by the country.[_citation needed_]\nZimbabwe's GDP grew on average by about 4.5% between 1980 and 1990.\n\nIn 1992, a World Bank study indicated that more than 500 health centres had\nbeen built since 1980. The percentage of children vaccinated increased from\n25% in 1980 to 67% in 1988, and life expectancy increased from 55 to 59 years.\nEnrolment increased by 232 percent one year after primary education was made\nfree, and secondary school enrolment increased by 33 percent in two years.\nThese social policies lead to an increase in the debt ratio. Several laws were\npassed in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce wage gaps. However, the gaps\nremained considerable. In 1988, the law gave women, at least in theory, the\nsame rights as men. Previously, they could only take a few personal\ninitiatives without the consent of their father or husband.\n\nThe government started crumbling when a bonus to independence war veterans was\nannounced in 1997 (which was equal to 3 percent of GDP) followed by unexpected\nspending due to Zimbabwe's involvement in the Second Congo War in 1998. In\n1999, the country also witnessed a drought which further weakened the economy,\nultimately leading to the country's bankruptcy in the next decade. In the same\nyear, 1999, Zimbabwe experienced its first defaults on its IMF, World Bank,\nand African Development Bank debts in addition to debts taken out with Western\nlenders."

    "text": "In recent years, there has been economic hardship in Zimbabwe. Multiple\nwestern countries argue that the Government of Zimbabwe's land reform program,\nrecurrent interference with, and intimidation of the judiciary, as well as\nmaintenance of unrealistic price controls and exchange rates has led to a\nsharp drop in investor confidence.\n\nBetween 2000 and December 2007, the national economy contracted by as much as\n40%; inflation vaulted to over 66,000%, and there were persistent shortages of\nhard currency, fuel, medicine, and food. GDP per capita dropped by 40%,\nagricultural output dropped by 51% and industrial production dropped by 47%.\n[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Mugabe Government attribute Zimbabwe's economic difficulties to sanctions\nimposed by the Western powers. It has been argued[_by whom?_] that the\nsanctions imposed by Britain, the US, and the EU have been designed to cripple\nthe economy and the conditions of the Zimbabwean people in an attempt to\noverthrow President Mugabe's government. These countries on their side argue\nthat the sanctions are targeted against Mugabe and his inner circle and some\nof the companies they own. Critics[_who?_] point to the so-called \"Zimbabwe\nDemocracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001\", signed by Bush, as an effort to\nundermine Zimbabwe's economy. Soon after the bill was signed, IMF cut off its\nresources to Zimbabwe. Financial institutions began withdrawing support for\nZimbabwe. Terms of the sanctions made it such that all economic assistance\nwould be structured in support of \"democratisation, respect for human rights\nand the rule of law.\" The EU terminated its support for all projects in\nZimbabwe. Because of the sanctions and US and EU foreign policy, none of\nZimbabwe's debts have been cancelled as in other countries.\n\nOther observers also point out how the asset freezes by the EU on people or\ncompanies associated with Zimbabwe's Government have had significant economic\nand social costs to Zimbabwe.\n\nAs of February 2004, Zimbabwe's foreign debt repayments ceased, resulting in\ncompulsory suspension from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This, and\nthe United Nations World Food Programme stopping its food aid due to\ninsufficient donations from the world community, has forced the government\ninto borrowing from local sources."

In\n2004 a system of auctioning scarce foreign currency for importers was\nintroduced, which temporarily led to a slight reduction in the foreign\ncurrency crisis, but by mid-2005 foreign currency shortages were once again\nsevere. The currency was devalued by the central bank twice, first to 9,000 to\nthe US$, and then to 17,500 to the US$ on 20 July 2005, but at that date it\nwas reported that that was only half the rate available on the black market.\n\nIn July 2005 Zimbabwe was reported to be appealing to the South African\ngovernment for US$1 billion of emergency loans, but despite regular rumours\nthat the idea was being discussed no substantial financial support has been\npublicly reported.\n\nIn December 2005 Zimbabwe made a mystery loan repayment of US$120 million to\nthe International Monetary Fund due to expulsion threat from IMF.\n\nThe official Zimbabwean dollar exchange rate had been frozen at Z$101,196 per\nU.S. dollar since early 2006, but as of 27 July 2006 the parallel (black\nmarket) rate has reached Z$550,000 per U.S. dollar. By comparison, 10 years\nearlier, the rate of exchange was only Z$9.13 per USD.\n\nIn August 2006 the RBZ revalued the Zimbabwean Dollar by 1000 ZWD to 1\n(revalued) dollar. At the same time Zimbabwe devalued the Zim Dollar by 60%\nagainst the USD. New official exchange rate revalued ZWD 250 per USD. The\nparallel market rate was about revalued ZWD 1,200 to 1,500 per USD (28\nSeptember 2006).\n\nIn November 2006, it was announced that sometime around 1 December there would\nbe a further devaluation and that the official exchange rate would change to\nrevalued ZWD 750 per USD. This never materialized. However, the parallel\nmarket immediately reacted to this news with the parallel rate falling to ZWD\n2,000 per USD (18 November 2006) and by year end it had fallen to ZWD 3,000\nper USD.\n\nOn 1 April 2007, the parallel market was asking ZWD 30,000 for US$1. By year\nend, it was down to about ZWD 2,000,000. On 18 January 2008, the Reserve Bank\nof Zimbabwe began to issue higher denomination ZWD bearer cheques (a banknote\nwith an expiry date), including $10 million bearer cheques – each of which was\nworth less than US$1.35 (70p Sterling; 0.90 Euro) on the parallel market at\nthe time of first issue. On 4 April 2008 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe\nintroduced new $25 million and $50 million bearer cheques. At the time of\nfirst issue they were worth US$0.70 and US$1.40 on the parallel market\nrespectively.\n\nOn 1 May 2008, the RBZ announced that the dollar would be allowed to float in\nvalue subject to some conditions.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, the RBZ issued new $100 million and $250 million bearer\ncheques. At the date of first issue the $250 million bearer cheque was worth\napproximately US$1.30 on the parallel market. On 15 May 2008, a new $500\nmillion bearer cheque was issued by the RBZ. At the time of the first issue it\nwas worth US$1.93. In a widely unreported parallel move, on 15 May 2008, the\nRBZ issued three \"special agro-cheques\" with face values $5 billion (at time\nof first issue – $19.30), $25 billion ($96.50) and $50 billion ($193). It is\nfurther reported that the new agro-cheques can be used to buy any goods and\nservices like the bearer cheques.\n\nOn 30 July 2008, the Governor of the RBZ, Gideon Gono announced that the\nZimbabwe dollar would be redenominated by removing 10 zeroes, with effect from\n1 August 2008. ZWD10billion became 1 dollar after the redenomination.\n\nMore banknotes were issued since Gono vowed to continue printing money:\n$10,000 and $20,000 (29 September); $50,000 (13 October); $100,000, $500,000\nand $1 million (3 November); $10 million (2 December); $50 million and $100\nmillion (4 December); $200 million (9 December); $500 million (11 December);\n$10 billion (19 December); $1 trillion (17 January 2009).\n\nOn February 2, 2009, a final denomination was implemented, cutting 12 zeroes,\nbefore the Zimbabwe dollar was officially abandoned on April 12, 2009. Pending\neconomic recovery, Zimbabwe relied on foreign currency rather than introducing\na new currency."

    "text": "In February 2009, the newly installed national unity government (which\nincluded the opposition to Mugabe) allowed foreign currency transactions\nthroughout the economy as a measure to stimulate the economy and end\ninflation. The Zimbabwean dollar quickly lost all credibility, and by April\n2009, the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended entirely, to be replaced by the US\ndollar in government transactions. In 2014 there were eight legal currencies –\nUS dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling,\nAustralian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.\n\nDollarization reversed inflation, permitting the banking system to stabilize\nand the economy to resume slow growth after 2009. Dollarization also had other\nconsequences, including:\n\n* Reduced taxation and financial transparency, as people continued to keep their money out of the formal banking system.\n* Extremely high real interest rates due to lack of capital.\n* Government forced into a \"pay as you go\" system, unable to spend more than it takes in.\n* Deficits of coinage for everyday transactions, leading to the adoption of South African rand coins, sweets, airtime for mobile phones or even condoms for small change.\n* Counterfeiting currencies with which Zimbabweans are not familiar.\n* 10% growth of the economy a year up to 2012\n\nIn January, 2013 Finance Minister Tendai Biti announced that Zimbabwe's\nnational public account held just $217. The election budget for the July 2013\npresidential election was $104 million and government budget for 2013 was\n$3.09 billion at a projected economic growth of 5 per cent. The Economist\ndescribed the 2013 election as \"rigged\" and how, after regaining full control\nof the government, the Mugabe government doubled the civil service and\nembarked on \"...misrule and dazzling corruption.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Zimbabwe began selling treasury bills and bonds to pay public\nsector salaries that have been delayed as GDP growth weakens while the economy\nexperiences deflation. US$2 million was sold in July through private\nplacements of Six-month Treasury bills at an interest rate of 9.5%. According\nto IMF data, GDP growth was forecast to be 3.1% by the end of 2014, a major\ndecline from an average rate of 10% between 2009 and 2012, while government\ndata showed that consumer prices declined for five consecutive months by the\nend of June. The Reserve Bank continued to issue large values of treasury\nbills to support the government's over-budget spending. This added to the\nmoney supply and in effect devalued all bank balances, despite them being US\nDollar denominated.\n\nIn November 2016 a pseudo-currency was issued in the form of Bond Notes\ndespite widespread protests against them. In February 2019, John Mangudya,\nthrough a monetary policy presentation formally introduced a new currency, the\nRTGS dollar which consists of electronic balances in banks and mobile wallets,\nbond notes and bond coins. This completed the conversion of all US Dollar\ndenominated bank balances to a devalued Zimbabwean currency at a rate of 1:1.\n\nIn June 2019 the use of foreign currencies in local transactions was\nprohibited as part of the prospective plan for a new national currency and\nthus ended the dollarization period. There was still low volume trade in US\nDollars, particularly in the informal sector and using in-shop bureau de\nchange. In March 2020, blaming the challenges of dealing with COVID-19, the\ngovernment allowed formal transactions in US Dollars once more. Zimbabwe once\nmore extended its multi-currency system from 2025 until 31 December 2030 in\nOctober 2023 as a result of declining trust in the Zimbabwean dollar, which\nalso declined by more than 80% in 2023."

Policies encouraging the\nindigenisation of the economy were fast tracked and laws requiring that 51% or\nmore of non-black Zimbabwean owned companies had to be handed over to black\nZimbabweans were implemented. This has been credited with creating further\nuncertainty in the economy and negatively impacting investment climate in the\ncountry. Although legislation dealing with the indigenisation of the\nZimbabwean economy has been in development since 2007 and actively initiated\nby ZANU-PF in 2010 the policy has continued to be accused of being unclear and\na form of \"racketeering by regulation.\" The government doubled the civil\nservice and embarked on what the Economist described as \"...misrule and\ndazzling corruption.\"\n\nIn April 2014, Chinamasa admitted that the country was heavily in debt and\nthat the country needed to better attract foreign direct investment.\nOfficially Zimbabwe's debt is $7 billion, or over 200% of the country's GDP.\nHowever, this figure is disputed, with figures as high as $11 billion being\nquoted, once debts to other African countries and China are included. As of\nMay 2014, it has been reported that Zimbabwe's economy was in decline\nfollowing the period of relative economic stability during the Government of\nNational Unity. It is estimated that Zimbabwe's manufacturing sector requires\nan investment of roughly US$8 billion for working capital and equipment\nupgrades.\n\nIn 2016 Tendai Biti, an opposition politician estimated the government was\nrunning a deficit of up to 12% of GDP and Zimbabwe began experiencing a\nsignificant shortage of US dollars partly due to a consistent trade deficit.\nThis prompted the Zimbabwean government to limit cash withdrawals from banks\nand change exchange-control regulations in order to try to promote exports and\nreduce the currency shortage. In June and July 2016, after Government\nemployees had not been paid for weeks, police had set up road blocks to coerce\nmoney out of tourists and there were protests throughout Zimbabwe, Patrick\nChinamasa, the finance minister, toured Europe in an effort to raise\ninvestment capital and loans, admitting \"Right now we have nothing.\" In August\n2016 the government announced that it would be laying off 25,000 civil\nservants (8% of the country's 298,000 civil servants), cut the number of\nembassies and diplomatic expenses and cut ministerial expenses in an attempt\nto save $4 billion in annual wages and secure help from the World Bank and the\nIMF.\n\nAt the same time, the government sought to improve women's access to\nmicrofinance via the Zimbabwe Women Microfinance Bank Limited, which began\noperations 29 May 2018. The Bank operates under the supervision of the\nMinistry of Women's Affairs, Gender and Community Development."
