    "text": "From 1715 to 1791, Luxembourg was under Austro-Hungarian rule. At the time, it\nwas predominantly rural. It has been described as largely isolated. It had no\nroad connections to Brussels, which limited its ability to trade with\nneighbors. Towards the end of the 18th century, long-distance paved roads were\nconstructed, which integrated Luxembourg with neighboring markets.\n\nThe first land survey in Luxembourg was conducted after a decree by Maria-\nTheresa in 1766. The land survey was part of a broader reform effort to\nabolish certain feudal privileges and encourage more egalitarianism.\n\nFull abolition of feudalism in Luxembourg took place in 1795 when Luxembourg\nwas made part of the French revolutionary regime. It was part of Napoleonic\nFrance until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the Eastern part of\nLuxembourg to Prussia while the remainder formed the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\nunder Dutch rule. Under Dutch rule, new taxes and customs tariffs were\nintroduced, which harmed commerce in Luxembourg and contributed to it\nremaining a rural country.\n\nThe 1839 Treaty of London divided part of Luxembourg into a province of newly\nindependent Belgium while the remainder became the independent Grand Duchy of\nLuxembourg. During the first half of the 19th century, Luxembourg remained\nrural, although there was an emergence of a textile industry. In the second\nhalf of the 19th century, Luxembourg developed a steel industry, which would\nbecome the dominant sector.",

    "text": "Since the Holding Act of 1929, Luxembourg has been an attractive location for\ntax avoidance. A network of lawyers, bankers and political elites have since\nthen maintained an infrastructure of regulatory codes, legal expertise and\nshell companies that enable tax avoidance. Concern about Luxembourg's banking\nsecrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being\nadded to a \"grey list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by\nthe G20, a list from which it was removed in 2009. This concern has led\nLuxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax\nauthorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt\n1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an\nillegal state aid by the European Commission.\n\nNearly 90 percent of companies operating in Luxembourg are foreign.\nApproximately 40 percent of Luxembourg companies do not engage in any\nmeaningful economic activity in Luxembourg: they just hold assets in\nLuxembourg."

    "text": "Contrary to the belief of a large number of national historians, the financial\ncenter of Luxembourg was not a product that simply saw success out of nowhere\nin the 70s. In their article, Calabrese and Majerus argue that the Holding Law\nof 1929 (H29) was more than just a historical side note, but rather a\nfoundation that laid the future of the country’s financial success. In essence\nthe law was a legal tool that would help companies in avoiding double taxation\non financial assets, mainly by creating a dummy corporations and profiting\nfrom the low taxes the country offered for these kinds of companies. The newly\nintroduced Holding regime was successful. Within a span of three years, the\ncapital estimations for the holding companies not only met but exceeded\nexpectations, reaching a total surpassing 2 billion Luxembourg francs. Among\nthe biggest holdings was The Ford Investment Company set up in early 1930. The\nHolding, enabled by the legislation, could avoid UK tax on the dividends of\nits subsidiary companies in Europe. This type of company could however, also\nbe used to loan money or make investments, like in the case of Ford by buying\nfactories for European subsidiaries for example. The Law was accompanied by\nthe creation of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange a year earlier, which would\nconstitute another important institution to round off the construction of a\nnational financial center. In the interwar period, the role these Holding\ncompanies played as a source of revenue started to materialize. While the\ndiscussions on the adoption of the Holding Law saw opposition members argue\nagainst it, discussions on later modifications on the Law would not see a\nstrong opposition anymore due to its contribution to the state’s tax revenues.\n\nH29 also enabled the creation of networks and practices. Following its\nimplementation, Luxembourg experienced the establishment of a network\ninvolving lawyers, banks, and notaries closely associated with the local\npolitical elite. This network successfully developed and maintained an\ninfrastructure comprising regulatory codes, legal expertise, and shell\ncompanies, rendering it appealing within the European market for tax\navoidance. Additionally, H29 majorly contributed to the establishment of a\nlegal framework that would pave the way for the future use of investment\nfunds, by establishing a positive reputation among investors and proving\nitself to be a competent key-player on the market. As a result, Luxembourg was\nchosen in 1963 to list the first and a large part of the Eurobonds on the\nLuxembourg Stock Exchange, a choice that only could have been made with the\nawareness of a financial center that could keep up with others such as London,\nwhich were also used in the case of Eurobonds.\n\nConsequently, the Holding Law of 1929 had a large and long lasting impact on\nthe construction of a domestic financial place, an impact that should not be\ndisregarded when presenting the economic history of the country."

    "text": "Luxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services.\nThe road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147 km\nof motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the\nhigh-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway\nstation while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been\nopened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during\nthe last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020 : 4 mio expected), and the second stage of\nexpansion is on its way.\n\nTrams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end\n2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-\nAlzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both\nresidents and visitors."
