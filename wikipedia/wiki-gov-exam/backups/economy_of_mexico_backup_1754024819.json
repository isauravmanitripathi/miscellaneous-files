    "text": "The **economy of Mexico** is a developing mixed-market economy. It is the 13th\nlargest in the world in nominal GDP terms and by purchasing power parity as of\n2024. Since the 1994 crisis, administrations have improved the country's\nmacroeconomic fundamentals. Mexico was not significantly influenced by the\n2002 South American crisis and maintained positive, although low, rates of\ngrowth after a brief period of stagnation in 2001. However, Mexico was one of\nthe Latin American nations most affected by the 2008 recession, with its gross\ndomestic product contracting by more than 6% that year. Among OECD nations,\nMexico has a fairly strong social security system; social expenditure stood at\nroughly 7.5% of GDP.\n\nThe Mexican economy has maintained high macroeconomic stability, reducing\ninflation and interest rates to record lows. Despite this, significant gaps\npersist between the urban and the rural population, the northern and southern\nstates, and the rich and the poor. Some of the unresolved issues include the\nupgrade of infrastructure, the modernization of the tax system and labor laws,\nand the reduction of income inequality. Tax revenues, 19.6 percent of GDP in\n2013, were the lowest among the 34 OECD countries. The main problems Mexico\nfaces are poverty rates and regional inequalities remaining high. The lack of\nformality, financial exclusion, and corruption has limited productivity\ngrowth. The medium-term growth prospects were also affected by a lower\nproportion of women in the workforce, and investment has not been strong since\n2015.\n\nThe economy contains rapidly developing modern industrial and service sectors,\nwith increasing private ownership. Recent administrations have expanded\ncompetition in ports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity generation,\nnatural gas distribution, and airports, to upgrade infrastructure. As an\nexport-oriented economy, more than 90% of Mexican trade is under free trade\nagreements (FTAs) with more than 40 countries, including the European Union,\nJapan, Israel, and much of Central and South America. The most influential FTA\nis the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into effect\nin 2020 and was signed in 2018 by the governments of the United States,\nCanada, and Mexico. In 2006, trade with Mexico's two northern partners\naccounted for almost 90% of its exports and 55% of its imports. Recently,\nCongress approved important tax, pension, and judicial reforms.[_clarification\nneeded_] In 2023, Mexico had 13 companies in the Forbes Global 2000 list of\nthe world's largest companies.\n\nMexico's labor force consisted of 52.8 million people as of 2015. The OECD and\nWTO both rank Mexican workers as the hardest-working in the world in terms of\nthe number of hours worked yearly. Pay per hour worked remains low.\n\nMexico is a highly unequal country: 0.2% of the population owns 60% of the\ncountry's wealth, while 46.8 million people live in poverty (2024).",

    "text": "Porfirio Díaz, (1876–1911) in whose presidency rapid industrialization took\nplace in foreign capital.\n\nThe Porfiriato brought unprecedented economic growth during the last quarter\nof the nineteenth century. This growth was accompanied by foreign investment\nand European immigration, the development of railroad networks and the\nexploitation of the country's natural resources. Annual economic growth\nbetween 1876 and 1910 averaged 3.3%. Large-scale ownership made considerable\nprogress while foreign land companies accumulated millions of hectares. At the\nend of Porfirio Díaz's dictatorship, 97% of arable land belonged to 1% of the\npopulation and 95% of peasants were landless, becoming farmworkers in huge\nhaciendas or forming an impoverished urban proletariat whose revolts were\ncrushed one by one.\n\nPolitical repression and fraud, as well as huge income inequalities\nexacerbated by the land distribution system based on _latifundios_ , in which\nlarge haciendas were owned by a few but worked by millions of impoverished\npeasants living in precarious conditions, led to the Mexican Revolution\n(1910–1920), an armed conflict that drastically transformed Mexico's\npolitical, social, cultural, and economic structure during the twentieth\ncentury. The war left a harsh toll on the economy and population, which\ndecreased over the 11-year years between 1910 and 1921. The reconstruction of\nthe country was to take place in the following decades.\n\nThe period from 1940 to 1970 has been dubbed by economic historians as the\nMexican Miracle, a period of economic growth that followed the end of the\nMexican Revolution and the resumption of capital accumulation during\npeacetime. During this period, Mexico adopted an import substitution\nindustrialization (ISI) model, which protected and promoted the development of\nnational industries. Mexico experienced an economic boom through which\nindustries rapidly expanded their production. Important changes in the\neconomic structure included free land distribution to peasants under the\nconcept of _ejido_ , the nationalization of the oil and railroad companies,\nthe introduction of social rights into the 1917 Constitution, the birth of\nlarge and influential labor unions, and the upgrading of infrastructure. While\nthe population doubled from 1940 to 1970, GDP increased sixfold during the\nsame period.\n\nPresident José López Portillo 1976–1982, during whose administration the\neconomy soared with the discovery of oil and then crashed when the price\ndropped.\n\nGrowth, while under the ISI model, had reached its peak in the late 1960s.\nDuring the 1970s, the presidential administrations of Luis Echeverría\n(1970–76) and José López Portillo (1976–82) tried to include social\ndevelopment in their policies, an effort that entailed increased public\nspending. With the discovery of vast oil fields during a period of oil price\nincreases and low international interest rates, the government borrowed from\ninternational capital markets to invest in the state-owned oil company Pemex,\nwhich in turn seemed to provide a long-run income source to promote social\nwelfare. This produced a remarkable growth in public expenditure, and\npresident López Portillo announced that the time had come to \"manage\nprosperity\" as Mexico multiplied its oil production to become the world's\nfourth-largest exporter.\n\nAverage annual GDP growth by period  1900–1929  | 3.4%\n---|---\n1929–1945  | 4.2%\n1945–1972  | 6.5%\n1972–1981  | 5.5%\n1981–1995  | 1.5%\n1983 Debt Crisis  | -4.2%\n1995 Peso Crisis  | -6.2%\n1995–2000  | 5.1%\n2001 US Recession  | -0.2%\n2009 Great Recession  | -6.5%\n\nFrom 1981 to 1982 the international panorama changed abruptly: oil prices\nplunged and interest rates rose. In 1982, López Portillo, just before ending\nhis administration, suspended payments of foreign debt, devalued the peso, and\nnationalized the banking system, along with many other industries that were\nseverely affected by the crisis, among them the steel industry. While import\nsubstitution had contributed to Mexican industrialization, by the 1980, thes\nprotracted protection of Mexican companies had led to an uncompetitive\nindustrial sector with low productivity gains.\n\nPresident Miguel de la Madrid (1982–88) was the first of a series of\npresidents who implemented neoliberal policies. After the crisis of 1982,\nlenders were unwilling to return to Mexico, and in order to keep the current\naccount in balance, the government resorted to currency devaluations, which\nsparked unprecedented inflation, reaching an annual record of 139.7% in 1987.\n\nOne of the first steps toward trade liberalization was Mexico's signature of\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1986 under President de\nla Madrid. During the administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–94),\nmany state-owned companies were privatized. The telephone company Telmex, a\ngovernment monopoly, became a private monopoly, sold to Carlos Slim. Also not\nopened to private investors were the government oil company Pemex or the\nenergy sector. Furthermore, the banking system that had been nationalized in\nthe waning hours of the López Portillo administration in 1982 was privatized,\nbut with the exclusion of foreign banks. Salinas pushed for Mexico's inclusion\nin the North American Free Trade Agreement, expanding it from a U.S.-Canada\nagreement. The expanded NAFTA was signed in 1992, after the signature of two\nadditional supplements on environments and labor standards. It came into\neffect on January 1, 1994.\n\nSalinas also introduced strict price controls and negotiated smaller minimum\nwage increments with the labor union movement under the aging Fidel Velázquez\nto curb inflation. While his strategy successfully reduced inflation, growth\naveraged only 2.8 percent a year. By fixing the exchange rate, the peso became\nrapidly overvalued while consumer spending increased, causing the current\naccount deficit to reach 7% of GDP in 1994. The deficit was financed through\n_tesobonos,_ a public debt instrument that reassured payment in dollars.\n\nThe January 1994 Chiapas uprising, and the assassinations of the ruling\nparty's presidential candidate in March 1994, Luis Donaldo Colosio and the\nSecretary-General of the party and brother of the Assistant-Attorney General\nJosé Francisco Ruiz Massieu in 1994, reduced investor confidence. Public debt\nholders rapidly sold their _tesobonos_ , depleting the Central Bank's\nreserves, while portfolio investments, which had made up 90% of total\ninvestment flows, left the country as fast as they had come in.\n\nThis unsustainable situation eventually forced the entrant Zedillo\nadministration to adopt a floating exchange rate. The peso sharply devalued,\nand the country entered into an economic crisis in December 1994. The boom in\nexports, as well as an international rescue package crafted by U.S. president\nBill Clinton (1993-2001), helped cushion the crisis. The economy was growing\nagain in less than 18 months, and annual rate growth averaged 5.1 percent\nbetween 1995 and 2000. More critical interpretations argue that the crisis and\nsubsequent public bailout \"preserved, renewed, and intensified the\nstructurally unequal social relations of power and class characteristic of\nfinance-led neoliberal capitalism\" in forms institutionally specific to\nMexican society with GDP growth spurred by one-time privatizations. Per capita\neconomic growth in the 2000s was low.\n\nPresident Ernesto Zedillo (1994–2000), and President Vicente Fox (2000–06), of\nthe National Action Party (Mexico), the first opposition party candidate to\nwin a presidential election since the founding of the precursor of the\nInstitutional Revolutionary Party in 1929, continued with trade\nliberalization. During Fox's administrations, several FTAs were signed with\nLatin American and European countries, Japan and Israel, and both strove to\nmaintain macroeconomic stability. Thus, Mexico became one of the most open\ncountries in the world to trade, and the economic base shifted accordingly.\nTotal trade with the United States and Canada tripled, and total exports and\nimports almost quadrupled between 1991 and 2003. The nature of foreign\ninvestment also changed with a greater share of foreign direct investment\n(FDI) over portfolio investment. The wealth of Mexico's leading billionaires\nstems from the privatizations of the 1990s, when the country sold off its\nstate-owned companies at low prices: telecoms (Telmex) to Carlos Slim, trains\n(Ferromex) to German Larrea, and television (TV Azteca) to Ricardo Salinas.",

This program was further extended during President Cárdenas'\nadministration during the 1930s and continued into the 1960s at varying rates.\nThe cooperative agrarian reform, which guaranteed small farmers a means of\nsubsistence livelihood, also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital\ninvestment, since commonly held land could not be used as collateral. To raise\nrural productivity and living standards, this constitutional article was\namended in 1992 to allow for the transfer of property rights of communal lands\nto farmers cultivating it. With the ability to rent or sell it, a way was open\nfor the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale.\nLarge mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states (mainly\nin Sinaloa). However, privatization of _ejidos_ continues to be very slow in\nthe central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce\nonly for subsistence.[_citation needed_]\n\nUntil the 1980s, the government encouraged the production of basic crops\n(mainly corn and beans) by maintaining support prices and controlling imports\nthrough the National Company for Popular Subsistence (CONASUPO). With trade\nliberalization, however, CONASUPO was gradually dismantled, and two new\nmechanisms were implemented: Alianza and Procampo. Alianza provides income\npayments and incentives for mechanization and advanced irrigation systems.\nProcampo is an income transfer subsidy to farmers. This support program offers\n3.5 million farmers who produce basic commodities (mostly corn), representing\n64% of all farmers, with a fixed income transfer payment per unit of cropland\narea. This subsidy increased substantially during President Fox's\nadministration, mainly to white corn producers, to reduce imports from the\nUnited States. This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15%\nof corn imports were white corn –the one used for human consumption and the\ntype that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed\ncorn –the one used for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in\nMexico.",

The\nautomobile sector in Mexico differs from that in other Latin American\ncountries and developing nations in that it does not function as a mere\nassembly manufacturer. The industry produces technologically complex\ncomponents and engages in some research and development activities, an example\nof that is the new Volkswagen Jetta model with up to 70% of parts designed in\nMexico.\n\nThe \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) have been operating in\nMexico since the 1930s, while Volkswagen and Nissan built their plants in the\n1960s. Later, Toyota, Honda, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz have also participated.\nGiven the high requirements of North American components in the industry, many\nEuropean and Asian parts suppliers have also moved to Mexico: in Puebla alone,\n70 industrial part-makers cluster around Volkswagen.\n\nThe relatively small domestic car industry is represented by DINA Camiones, a\nmanufacturer of trucks, busses and military vehicles, which through domestic\nproduction and purchases of foreign bus manufacturers has become the largest\nbus manufacturer in the world; Vehizero that builds hybrid trucks and the new\ncar companies Mastretta design that builds the Mastretta MXT sports car and\nAutobuses King that plans to build 10000 microbuses by 2015, nevertheless new\ncar companies are emerging among them CIMEX that has developed a sport utility\ntruck, the Conin, and it is to be released in September 2010 in Mexico's\nnational auto show, And the new electric car maker Grupo Electrico Motorizado.\nSome large industries of Mexico include Cemex, the world's largest\nconstruction company and the third largest cement producer the alcohol\nbeverage industries, including world-renowned players like Grupo Modelo;\nconglomerates like FEMSA, which apart from being the largest single producer\nof alcoholic beverages and owning multiple commercial interests such OXXO\nconvenience store chain, is also the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the\nworld; Gruma, the largest producer of corn flour and tortillas in the world;\nand Grupo Bimbo, Telmex, Televisa, among many others. In 2005, according to\nthe World Bank, high-tech industrial production represented 19.6% of total\nexports.\n\nThe original Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewery in Monterrey, founded in 1889.\nToday, it still operates as a brewery and houses two museums.\n\nMaquiladoras (manufacturing plants that take in imported raw materials and\nproduce goods for domestic consumption and export on behalf of foreign\ncompanies) have become the landmark of trade in Mexico. This sector has\nbenefited from NAFTA, in that real income in the maquiladora sector has\nincreased 15.5% since 1994, though the non-maquiladora industry has grown much\nfaster. Contrary to popular belief, this should be no surprise since\nmaquiladora's products could enter the US duty-free since a 1960s industry\nagreement. Other sectors now benefit from the free trade agreement, and the\nshare of exports from non-border states has increased in the last 5 years\nwhile the share of exports from maquiladora-border states has decreased.\n\nCurrently, Mexico is focusing on developing an aerospace industry, and the\nassembly of helicopter and regional jet aircraft fuselages is taking place.\nForeign firms such as MD Helicopters, Bell, Cessna and Bombardier build\nhelicopter, aircraft and regional jets fuselages in Mexico. Although the\nMexican aircraft industry is mostly foreign, as is its car industry, Mexican\nfirms have been founded such as Aeromarmi, which builds light propeller\nairplanes, and Hydra Technologies, which creates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles such\nas the S4 Ehécatl, other important companies are Frisa Aerospace that\nmanufactures jet engine parts for the new Mitsubishi Regional jet and supplies\nPrat&whittney and Rolls-Royce jet engine manufacturers of casings for jet\nengines and Kuo Aerospace that builds parts for aircraft landing gear and\nSupplies bombardier plant in Querétaro.\n\nAs compared with the United States or countries in Western Europe, a larger\nsector of Mexico's industrial economy is food manufacturing, which includes\nseveral world-class companies, but the regional industry is undeveloped. Some\nnational brands have become international and local Mom and Pop producers but\nlittle manufacturing in between."

The company manufactures whole products such televisions and\ndesigns individual components on behalf of Sharp such as LCD modules and in\nreturn Semex is granted access to Sharp capital, technology, research capacity\nand branding.

The largest\nfinancial institution in Mexico is Bancomer associated to the Spanish BBVA.\n\nThe process of institution building in the financial sector in Mexico has\nevolved hand in hand with the efforts of financial liberalization and of\ninserting the economy more fully into world markets. Over the recent years,\nthere has been a wave of acquisitions by foreign institutions such as US-based\nCitigroup, Spain's BBVA and the UK's HSBC. Their presence, along with a better\nregulatory framework, has allowed Mexico's banking system to recover from the\n1994–95 peso crisis. Lending to the public and private sector is increasing\nand so is activity in the areas of insurance, leasing and mortgages. However,\nbank credit accounts for only 22% of GDP, which is significantly low compared\nto 70% in Chile. Credit to the Agricultural sector has fallen 45.5% in six\nyears (2001 to 2007), and now represents about 1% of total bank loans. Other\nimportant institutions include savings and loans, credit unions (known as\n\"cajas populares\"), government development banks, “non-bank banks”, bonded\nwarehouses, bonding companies and foreign-exchange firms.\n\nA wave of acquisitions has left Mexico's financial sector in foreign hands.\nTheir foreign-run affiliates compete with independent financial firms\noperating as commercial banks, brokerage and securities houses, insurance\ncompanies, retirement-fund administrators, mutual funds, and leasing\ncompanies."

The market has grown steadily,\nwith its main indices increasing by more than 600% in the last decade. It is\nLatin America's second largest exchange, after Brazil's. The total value of\nthe domestic market capitalization of the BMV was calculated at US$409 billion\nat the end of 2011, and raised to US$451 billion by the end of February this\nyear.\n\nPacific Alliance-Logo Since 2014 it is part of the Mercado Integrado\nLatinoamericano, as part of a unified bag of The Pacific Alliance.\n\nThe Indice de Precios y Cotizaciones (IPC, the general equities index) is the\nbenchmark stock index on the Bolsa. In 2005 the IPC surged 37.8%, to 17,802.71\nfrom 12,917.88, backed by a stronger Mexican economy and lower interest rates.\nIt continued its steep rise through the beginning of 2006, reaching 19,272.63\npoints at end-March 2006. The stockmarket also posted a record low vacancy\nrate, according to the central bank. Local stockmarket capitalisation totalled\nUS$236bn at end-2005, up from US$170 bn at end-2004. As of March 2006 there\nwere 135 listed companies, down from 153 a year earlier. Only a handful of the\nlisted companies are foreign. Most are from Mexico City or Monterrey;\ncompanies from these two cities compose 67% of the total listed companies.\n\nThe IPC consists of a sample of 35 shares weighted according to their market\ncapitalisation. The largest companies include America Telecom, the holding\ncompany that manages Latin America's largest mobile company, América Móvil;\nTelmex, Mexico's largest telephone company; Grupo Bimbo, world's biggest\nbaker; and Wal-Mart de México, a subsidiary of the US retail company. The\nmakeup of the IPC is adjusted every six months, with selection aimed at\nincluding the most liquid shares in terms of value, volume and number of\ntrades.\n\nMexico's stock market is closely linked to developments in the US. Thus,\nvolatility in the New York and Nasdaq stock exchanges, as well as interest-\nrate changes and economic expectations in the US, can steer the performance of\nMexican equities. This is both because of Mexico's economic dependence on the\nUS and the high volume of trading in Mexican equities through American\nDepositary Receipts (ADRs). Currently, the decline in the value of the dollar\nis making non-US markets, including Mexico's, more attractive.\n\nDespite the recent gains, investors remain wary of making placements in\nsecond-tier initial public offerings (IPOs). Purchasers of new issues were\ndisappointed after prices fell in numerous medium-sized companies that made\nofferings in 1996 and 1997. IPO activity in Mexico remains tepid and the\nmarket for second-tier IPOs is barely visible. There were three IPOs in 2005."

It also possesses tools aimed at smoothing out\nvolatility. The Exchange Rate Commission sets policy; it is made up of six\nmembers—three each from the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaría\nde Hacienda y Crédito Publico—SHCP) and the central bank, with the SHCP\nholding the deciding vote.\n\nIn August 1996, Banco de México initiated a mechanism to acquire foreign\nreserves when the peso is strong, without giving the market signals about a\ntarget range for the exchange rate. The resulting high levels of reserves,\nmostly from petroleum revenues, have helped to improve the terms and\nconditions on debt Mexico places on foreign markets. However, there is concern\nthat the government relies too heavily on oil income in order to build a\nhealthy base of reserves. According to the central bank, international\nreserves stood at US$75.8 billion in 2007. In May 2003, Banco de México\nlaunched a program that sells U.S. dollars via a monthly auction, with the\ngoal of maintaining a stable, but moderate, level of reserves.\n\nFrom April 1, 1998, through April 1, 2008, the Peso traded around a range\nvarying from $8.46 MXN per US$1.00 on April 21, 1998, to $11.69 MXN per\nUS$1.00 on May 11, 2004, a 10-year peak depreciation of 38.18% between the two\nreference date extremes before recovering.\n\nAfter the onset of the US credit crisis that accelerated in October 2008, the\nPeso had an exchange rate during October 1, 2008, through April 1, 2009,\nfluctuating from lowest to highest between $10.96 MXN per US$1.00 on October\n1, 2008, to $15.42 MXN per US$1.00 on March 9, 2009, a peak depreciation ytd\nof 28.92% during those six months between the two reference date extremes\nbefore recovering.\n\nFrom the $11.69 rate during 2004's low to the $15.42 rate during 2009's low,\nthe peso depreciated 31.91% in that span covering the US recession coinciding\nIraq War of 2003 and 2004 to the US & Global Credit Crisis of 2008.\n\nSome experts including analysts at Goldman Sachs who coined the term BRIC in\nreference to the growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China for\nmarketing purposes believe that Mexico is going to be the 5th or 6th biggest\neconomy in the world by the year 2050, behind China, United States, India,\nBrazil, and possibly Russia."

It sets an inflation target,\nwhich requires it to establish corresponding quantitative targets for the\ngrowth of the monetary base and for the expansion of net domestic credit.\n\nThe central bank also monitors the evolution of several economic indicators,\nsuch as the exchange rate, differences between observed and projected\ninflation, the results of surveys on the public and specialists’ inflation\nexpectations, revisions on collective employment contracts, producer prices,\nand the balances of the current and capital accounts.\n\nA debate continues over whether Mexico should switch to a US-style interest\nrate-targeting system. Government officials in favor of a change say that the\nnew system would give them more control over interest rates, which are\nbecoming more important as consumer credit levels rise.[_citation needed_]\n\nUntil 2008[_citation needed_], Mexico used a unique system, amongst the OECD\ncountries, to control inflation in a mechanism known as the _corto_ (lit.\n\"shortage\") a mechanism that allowed the central bank to influence market\ninterest rates by leaving the banking system short of its daily demand for\nmoney by a predetermined amount. If the central bank wanted to push interest\nrates higher, it increased the _corto_. If it wished to lower interest rates,\nit decreased the _corto_.

An April 2012 article in _The New York Times_\nreporting payment of bribes to officials throughout Mexico in order to obtain\nconstruction permits, information, and other favors resulted in investigations\nin both the United States and Mexico.\n\nUsing relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in\ncomparison with Gross County Product, the informal sector of the local economy\nin Veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the Fox\nAdministration though the regional government remained PRI. The assumption\nthat the informal economy of Mexico is a constant 30% of total economic\nactivity is not supported at the local level. The small amount of local\nspatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low\nliteracy rates amongst municipios in Veracruz but not enough to warrant\nincluding an I-statistic as a regressor. Global spatial autocorrelation is\nfound especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for\nfurther research beyond this study.\n\nImproved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in Veracruz\nindicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the\nregional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence\nwas found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic\nactivity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the\nformal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in\n2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While\nrural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban\nmunicipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past\nthat might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have\nnot succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will\ncontinue to plague the state with low government revenues."

    "text": "The NAFTA emblem Dual carriageway highways in Mexico, in red. To facilitate\ntrade and exports, especially to the United States, Mexico has improved its\nhighways.\n\nThe 1994 North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is by far the most important\nTrade Agreement Mexico has signed both in the magnitude of reciprocal trade\nwith its partners as well as in its scope. Unlike the rest of the Free Trade\nAgreements that Mexico has signed, NAFTA is more comprehensive in its scope\nand was complemented by the North American Agreement for Environmental\nCooperation (NAAEC) and the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation\n(NAALC). An updating of the 1994 NAFTA, the U.S., Mexico, Canada (USMCA) is\npending in early 2020, awaiting the ratification by Canada; the U.S. and\nMexico have ratified it.\n\nThe NAAEC agreement was a response to environmentalists' concerns that\ncompanies would relocate to Mexico or the United States would lower its\nstandards if the three countries did not achieve a unanimous regulation on the\nenvironment. The NAAEC, in an aim to be more than a set of environmental\nregulations, established the North American Commission for Environmental\nCooperation (NACEC), a mechanism for addressing trade and environmental\nissues, the North American Development Bank (NADBank) for assisting and\nfinancing investments in pollution reduction and the Border Environmental\nCooperation Commission (BECC). The NADBank and the BECC have provided economic\nbenefits to Mexico by financing 36 projects, mostly in the water sector. By\ncomplementing NAFTA with the NAAEC, it has been labeled the \"greenest\" trade\nagreement.\n\nThe NAALC supplement to NAFTA aimed to create a foundation for cooperation\namong the three members for the resolution of labor problems, as well as to\npromote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all\nthree countries, in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions.\nThough most economists agree that it is difficult to assess the direct impact\nof the NAALC, it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor\nstandards in North America. Given its limitations, however, NAALC has not\nproduced (and in fact was not intended to achieve) convergence in employment,\nproductivity and salary trend in North America.\n\nThe agreement fell short in liberalizing movement of people across the three\ncountries. In a limited way, however, immigration of skilled Mexican and\nCanadian workers to the United States was permitted under the TN status. NAFTA\nallows for a wide list of professions, most of which require at least a\nbachelor's degree, for which a Mexican or a Canadian citizen can request TN\nstatus and temporarily immigrate to the United States. Unlike the visas\navailable to other countries, TN status requires no sponsorship, but simply a\njob offer letter.\n\nOutgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump,\nand Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sign the agreement during the G20\nsummit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 30, 2018.\n\nThe overall benefits of NAFTA have been quantified by several economists,\nwhose findings have been reported in several publications like the World\nBank's Lessons from NAFTA for Latin America and the Caribbean, NAFTA's Impact\non North America, and NAFTA revisited by the Institute for International\nEconomics. They assess that NAFTA has been positive for Mexico, whose poverty\nrates have fallen, and real income salaries have risen even after accounting\nfor the 1994–1995 economic crisis. Nonetheless, they also state that it has\nnot been enough, or fast enough, to produce an economic convergence nor to\nreduce the poverty rates substantially or to promote higher rates of growth.\nBeside this the textile industry gain hype with this agreement and the textile\nindustry in Mexico gained open access to the American market, promoting\nexports to the United States. The value of Mexican cotton and apparel exports\nto the U.S. grew from $3 billion in 1995 to $8.4 billion in 2002, a record\nhigh of $9.4 billion in 2000. At the same time, the share of Mexico's cotton\ntextile market the U.S. has increased from 8 percent in 1995 to 13 percent in\n2002.[_citation needed_] Some have suggested that in order to fully benefit\nfrom the agreement Mexico should invest in education and promote innovation as\nwell as in infrastructure and agriculture.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the maquiladora program existed far before NAFTA,\ndating to 1965. A maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials\ninto Mexico either tariff free (NAFTA) or at a reduced rate on a temporary\nbasis (18 months) and then using Mexico's relatively less expensive labor\ncosts to produce finished goods for export. Prior to NAFTA maquiladora\ncompanies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given\npreferential tariff rates by the Mexican government so long as the finished\ngood was for export. The US, prior to NAFTA, allowed Maquiladora manufactured\ngoods to be imported into the US with the tariff rate only being applied to\nthe value of non US raw materials used to produce the good, thus reducing the\ntariff relative to other countries. NAFTA has eliminated all tariffs on goods\nbetween the two countries, but for the maquiladora industry significantly\nincreased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of NAFTA.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nGiven the overall size of trade between Mexico and the United States, there\nare remarkably few trade disputes, involving relatively small dollar amounts.\nThese disputes are generally settled in WTO or NAFTA panels or through\nnegotiations between the two countries. The most significant areas of friction\ninvolve trucking, sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, and a number of other\nagricultural products."

The study examined the potential impacts of trade\nfacilitation reforms in four areas: port efficiency, customs administration,\ninformation technology, and regulatory environment (including standards).\n\nThe study projected overall increments from domestic reforms to be on the\norder of $31.8 billion, equivalent to 22.4 percent of total Mexican\nmanufacturing exports for 2000–03. On the imports side, the corresponding\nfigures are $17.1 billion and 11.2 percent, respectively.
