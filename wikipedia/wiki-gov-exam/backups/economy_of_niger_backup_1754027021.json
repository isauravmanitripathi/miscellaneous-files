This data is based\nlargely on internal markets, subsistence agriculture, and the export of raw\ncommodities: foodstuffs to neighbors and raw minerals to world markets. Niger,\na landlocked West African nation that straddles the Sahel, has consistently\nbeen ranked on the bottom of the Human Development Index, at 0.394 as of 2019.\nIt has a very low per capita income, and ranks among the least developed and\nmost heavily indebted countries in the world, despite having large raw\ncommodities and a relatively stable government and society not currently\naffected by civil war or terrorism. Economic activity centers on subsistence\nagriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of uranium.\n\nThe 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January 1994 boosted\nexports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's small\ncotton industry. Exports of cattle to neighboring Nigeria, as well as\ngroundnuts and oil remain the primary non-mineral exports. The government\nrelies on bilateral and multilateral aid – which was suspended briefly\nfollowing coups in 1996 and 1999 – for operating expenses and public\ninvestment. Short-term prospects depend on continued World Bank and IMF debt\nrelief and extended aid. The post-1999 government has broadly adhered to\nprivatization and market deregulation plans instituted by these funders. Niger\nis a least developed country according to the United Nations.",

    "text": "The fertile south of Niger near the Niger River. Map and growing season for\nthe Nigerien Rice crop. Chart shows Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\nagainst Long Rains Dry Season (July – Feb), measuring normal years crop growth\nin the major Rice producing areas of Niger.\n\nThe agricultural economy is based largely upon internal markets, subsistence\nagriculture, and the export of raw commodities: foodstuffs and cattle to\nneighbors. Foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although difficult to\nquantify, are considered the second source of export revenue behind mining and\noil exports. Actual exports far exceed official statistics, which often fail\nto detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides\nand skins are exported, and some are transformed into handicrafts.\n\nNiger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of\nthe population. 14% of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production\n(camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus\n53% of the population is actively involved in crop production. The 15% of\nNiger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with\nNigeria.\n\nDrought has turned farmland into useless soil. A farmer examines the soil in\ndrought-stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.\n\nIn these areas, Pearl millet, sorghum, and cassava are the principal rain-fed\nsubsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption is grown in parts\nof the Niger River valley in the west. While expensive, it has, since the\ndevaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice,\nencouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial\nexport, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat. Oasis\nfarming in small patches of the north of the country produces onions, dates,\nand some market vegetables for export.\n\nBut for the most part, rural residents engaged in crop tending are clustered\nin the south centre and south west of the nation, in those areas (the Sahel)\nwhich can expect to receive between 300 and 600 mm (12 and 24 in) of rainfall\nannually. A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding Gaya can\nexpect to receive 700 to 900 mm (28 to 35 in) or rainfall. Northern areas\nwhich support crops, such as the southern portions of the Aïr Massif and the\nKaouar oasis, rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to\nmountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation,\nwhile within the Sahara desert, see just enough seasonal rainfall to support\nsemi-nomadic animal husbandry. The populations of these areas, mostly Tuareg,\nWodaabe – Fula, and Toubou, travel south (a process called transhumance) to\npasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief\nrainy season.\n\nRainfall varies and when it is insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its\npopulation and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food\nrequirements. Rains, as in much of the Sahel, have been marked by annual\nvariability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the most\nsevere drought on record beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one\nbreak, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to\npastoralist populations, remains in the 21st century, with those communities\nwhich rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more\nthan once during this period. Recent rains remain variable. For instance, the\nrains in 2000 were not good, while those in 2001 were plentiful and well\ndistributed.\n\nSoils that have become degraded, for example by intensive cereal production,\ncover 50 per cent of Niger's land. Laterite soils have a high clay content,\nwhich means they have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding\ncapacity than sandy soils. If laterite soils become degraded, a hard crust can\nform on the surface, which hinders water infiltration and the emergence of\nseedlings. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called\nthe Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands.\n\nThis involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits\nand trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value\nfruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought\nconditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid\nTropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite\nsoils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes. Trials have\ndemonstrated that a 200 m2 (2,153 sq ft) plot can yield an income of around\nUS$100, which is what men traditionally earn from millet production per\nhectare (10000m2). As women are often given degraded soils, using this\npractice has helped to improve livelihoods for women in Niger.\n\nThe Kandadji Dam on the Niger River, whose construction started in August\n2008, is expected to improve agricultural production in the Tillaberi\nDepartment by providing water for the irrigation of 6,000 hectares initially\nand of 45,000 hectares by 2034.",

    "text": "The Niger mining industry is the main source of national exports, of which\nuranium is the largest export. Niger has been a uranium exporter since the\n1960s and has had substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during\nthe 1960s and 1970s. The persistent uranium price slump has brought lower\nrevenues for Niger's uranium sector, although it still provides 72% of\nnational export proceeds. When the uranium-led boom ended in the early 1980s\nthe economy stagnated, and new investment since then has been limited. Niger's\ntwo uranium mines—SOMAIR's open pit mine and COMINAK's underground mine—are\nowned by a French-led consortium and operated by French company Orano.\n\nAs of 2007[update], many licences have been sold to other companies from\ncountries such as India, China, Canada and Australia in order to exploit new\ndeposits. In 2013, the government of Niger sought to increase its uranium\nrevenue by subjecting the two mining companies to a 2006 Mining Law. The\ngovernment argued that the application of the new law will balance an\notherwise unfavorable partnership between the government and Areva. The\ncompany resisted the application of the new law that it feared would\njeopardize the financial health of the companies, citing declining market\nuranium prices and unfavorable market conditions. In 2014, following nearly a\nyear long negotiation with the government of Niger, Areva agreed to the\napplication of 2006 Mining Law of Niger, which would increase the government's\nuranium revenues from 5 to 12%.[_needs update_]\n\nA farmer collecting millet in Koremairwa village in the Dosso department.\n\nIn addition to uranium, exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in\nNiger in the region between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso.\nIn 2004, the first Nigerien gold ingot was produced from the Samira Hill Gold\nMine, in Tera Department. The Samira Hill Gold Mine thus became the first\ncommercial gold production in the country. The reserves at the location were\nestimated at 10,073,626 tons at an average grade of 2.21 grams (0.078 oz) per\nton from which 19,200 kilograms (42,300 lb) will be recovered over a six-year\nmine life.

Based on 2012 reports by the government\nof Niger, 246016 tons of coal were extracted by SONICHAR in 2011.

    "text": "Niger also gets partial access to hydroelectric power from dams created\nalongside the Niger River.[_unreliable source?_] Hydroelectric power\ncontributes about 280 megawatts (MW) to Niger's energy collectively from\nseveral hydropower sources, including 130 MW from the Kandadji, 122.5 from\nRiver Niger in Gambou, and 26 MW from Dyondyonga in Mekrou. Getting renewable\nenergy via hydropower has proven controversial, due to the importance of\nrainfall in acquiring energy. Again, these hydroelectric power dams are\ncreating energy for Niger via Nigeria.\n\nSolar energy has also been used to provide energy access. From 2004 to 2010\nsolar power generation was implemented, but there was a significant drop from\n2010 to 2012. However, since 2016 approximately 5 Gwh of solar power have been\nused.\n\nNiger has the potential to provide sustainable and renewable energy access\nwithin the country, which would help increase its energy intake and cope with\nthe growing demands of the population. Several projects have been discussed to\nmake use of clean energy sources such as solar power, hydropower, grid power,\nand wind power.\n\nMany NGOs are working on funding projects to provide sustainable and renewable\nenergy in parts of Africa. Affording the resources to create sustainable\nenergy is one of the biggest barrier Niger faces, but agencies such as\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and AbuDhabi Fund for\nDevelopment (ADFD) are funding low developing countries, including Niger, to\nhelp develop local renewable projects. Theses agencies will support projects\nincluding a hybrid micro-grid project employing solar PV and advanced lithium-\nion batteries, a hydropower project, integrated wind and solar, and a\ncombination project consisting of micro-grid and solar home kits. In addition,\nLighting Africa, an NGO primarily working in Niger, is assisting in\nsustainable energy development through two World Bank-sponsored Energy Access\nProjects: the Niger Solar Electricity Project (NESAP), and the Regional Off-\nGrid Electrification Project (ROGEP). These projects will work with grid\nsystems in two piloting countries, and this includes Niger. They will aim to\nincrease electricity access in households, businesses, and communities through\nmodern off-grid electrification.",
