    "text": "Namibia is a higher-middle-income country with an annual GDP per capita of\nN$79,431 in 2022, but has extreme inequalities in income distribution and\nstandard of living. It has the second-highest Gini coefficient out of all\nnations, with a coefficient of 59.1 as of 2015. Only South Africa has a higher\nGini coefficient. However, this statistic may be misleading, as many Namibians\nin rural areas such as the northern regions do not live on the monetary system\nare self-sustainable with agriculture and farming.\n\nSince independence, the Namibian Government has pursued free-market economic\nprinciples designed to promote commercial development and job creation to\nbring disadvantaged Namibians into the economic mainstream. To facilitate this\ngoal, the government has actively courted donor assistance and foreign\ninvestment. The liberal Foreign Investment Act of 1990 provides guarantees\nagainst nationalisation, freedom to remit capital and profits, currency\nconvertibility, and a process for settling disputes equitably. Namibia also is\naddressing the sensitive issue of agrarian land reform in a pragmatic manner.\nHowever, the government runs and owns a number of companies such as TransNamib\nand NamPost, most of which need frequent financial assistance to stay afloat.\n\nThe country's sophisticated formal economy is based on capital-intensive\nindustry and farming. However, Namibia's economy is heavily dependent on the\nearnings generated from primary commodity exports in a few vital sectors,\nincluding minerals, especially diamonds, livestock, and fish. Furthermore, the\nNamibian economy remains integrated with the economy of South Africa, as 47%\nof Namibia's imports originate from there.\n\nIn 1993, Namibia became a signatory of the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT), and the Minister of Trade and Industry represented Namibia at\nthe Marrakech signing of the Uruguay Round Agreement in April 1994. Namibia\nalso is a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nIn January 2021, President Hage Geingob formed the Namibia Investment\nPromotion and Development Board (NIPDB) led by Nangula Nelulu Uaandja. The\nNIPDB commenced operations as an autonomous entity in the Namibian Presidency\nand was established to reform the country's economic sector.",

Given its small domestic market\nbut favourable location and a superb transport and communications base,\nNamibia is a leading advocate of regional economic integration. In addition to\nits membership in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Namibia\npresently belongs to the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with South\nAfrica, Botswana, Lesotho, and Eswatini. Within SACU, there is no customs on\ngoods produced in, and being transported amidst, its members. Namibia is a net\nreceiver of SACU revenues; they are estimated to contribute 13.9 billion NAD\nin 2012.\n\nThe Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian\ndollar pegged to the South African rand. Privatisation of several enterprises\nin coming years may stimulate long-run foreign investment, although with the\ntrade union movement opposed, so far most politicians have been reluctant to\nadvance the issue. In September 1993, Namibia introduced its own currency, the\nNamibia Dollar (N$), which is linked to the South African Rand at a fixed\nexchange rate of 1:1. There has been widespread acceptance of the Namibia\nDollar throughout the country and, while Namibia remains a part of the Common\nMonetary Area, it now enjoys slightly more flexibility in monetary policy\nalthough interest rates have so far always moved very closely in line with the\nSouth African rates.[_citation needed_]\n\nNamibia imports almost all of its goods from South Africa. Many exports\nlikewise go to the South African market, or transit that country. Namibia's\nexports consist mainly of diamonds and other minerals, fish products, beef and\nmeat products, karakul sheep pelts, and light manufactures. In recent years,\nNamibia has accounted for about 5% of total SACU exports, and a slightly\nhigher percentage of imports.\n\nNamibia is seeking to diversify its trading relationships away from its heavy\ndependence on South African goods and services. Europe has become a leading\nmarket for Namibian fish and meat, while mining concerns in Namibia have\npurchased heavy equipment and machinery from Germany, the United Kingdom, the\nUnited States, and Canada. The Government of Namibia is making efforts to take\nadvantage of the American-led African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which\nwill provide preferential access to American markets for a long list of\nproducts.

However, reinvestment of environmentally derived capital\nhas hobbled Namibian per capita income.\n\nOne of the fastest growing areas of economic development in Namibia is the\ngrowth of wildlife conservancies. These conservancies are particularly\nimportant to the rural generally unemployed population.\n\nAgriculture is increasingly under pressure, due to factors such as frequent\nand prolonged droughts as well as woody plant encroachment. These render\nconventional agriculture unsustainable for a growing number of land owners,\nwith many diverting their economic activities to alternative of additional\nsources of income.\n\nIn recent years, the utilisation of residual biomass that results from the\ncontrol of woody plant encroachment has gained traction. In 2022, Namibia was\nthe seventh largest exporter of charcoal globally, with total export volumes\nof over 280,000 tonnes and revenues of USD 75 million. Other products from\nlocal encroacher biomass include bush-based animal fodder, wood-plastic\ncomposite materials, thermal energy in a cement factory and a brewery and\nbiochar.[_citation needed_] In 2019 it was estimated that 10,000 workers were\nemployed in the growing sub-sector of biomass utilisation, rendering it one of\nthe biggest sub-sectors in terms of employment."

Commercial fishing and fish\nprocessing is the fastest-growing sector of the Namibian economy in terms of\nemployment, export earnings, and contribution to GDP.\n\nThe main species found in abundance off Namibia are pilchards (sardines),\nanchovy, hake, and horse mackerel. There also are smaller but significant\nquantities of sole, squid, deep-sea crab, rock lobster, and tuna. At the time\nof independence, fish stocks had fallen to dangerously low levels, due to the\nlack of protection and conservation of the fisheries and the over-exploitation\nof these resources. This trend appears to have been halted and reversed since\nindependence, as the Namibian Government is now pursuing a conservative\nresource management policy along with an aggressive fisheries enforcement\ncampaign. The government seeks to develop fish-farming as an alternative and\nhas prioritised it as part of Vision 2030 and NDP2.\n\nOn 12 November 2019, WikiLeaks published thousands of documents and email\ncommunication by Samherji's employees, called the Fishrot Files, that\nindicated hundreds of millions ISK had been paid to high ranking politicians\nand officials in Namibia with the objective of acquiring the country's coveted\nfishing quota."

Namibian\nmanufacturing is inhibited by a small domestic market, dependence on imported\ngoods, limited supply of local capital, widely dispersed population, small\nskilled labour force and high relative wage rates, and subsidised competition\nfrom South Africa.\n\nWalvis Bay is a well-developed, deepwater port, and Namibia's fishing\ninfrastructure is most heavily concentrated there. The Namibian Government\nexpects Walvis Bay to become an important commercial gateway to the Southern\nAfrican region.\n\nNamibia also boasts world-class civil aviation facilities and an extensive,\nwell-maintained land transportation network. Construction is underway on two\nnew arteries—the Trans-Caprivi Highway and Trans-Kalahari Highway—which will\nopen up the region's access to Walvis Bay.\n\nThe Walvis Bay Export Processing Zone operates in the key port of Walvis Bay."

The government is aggressively\npursuing education reform to overcome this problem.\n\nThe country's unemployment rate was 33.4% in 2018, with a labour force of\n1,090,153. However, Namibia has a high percentage of skilled labour relative\nto SADC countries and have relatively low unemployment rates for skilled\nworkers. To fight high unemployment, particularly amongst the youth, the\ngovernment approved the introduction of an Internship Tax Incentive Programme\naimed at incentivising employers to enroll more interns by providing an\nadditional corporate tax deduction. The total financial implication for the\nGovernment is estimated at N$126 million.\n\nThe 2018 Namibia Labour Force Survey indicates that 99,536 people within the\nworking age population had tertiary education of any level (6.6% of the\nworking age population), while 21,922 (1.5% of the working age population) of\nthese had postgraduate education.\n\nAge group  | No education  | Primary  | Junior secondary  | Senior secondary  | Technical/vocational certificate or diploma  | Currently in year 1, 2 or 3 of tertiary education  | University certificate, diploma or degree  | Postgraduate certificate, diploma or degree\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n15-19  | 10,695  | 89,696  | 112,104  | 23,588  | 508  | 1,558  | 299  | 44\n20-24  | 19,090  | 37,177  | 99,661  | 58,909  | 6,185  | 9,498  | 6,019  | 212\n25-29  | 13,757  | 31,278  | 81,909  | 53,019  | 7,263  | 9,035  | 16,294  | 3,840\n30-34  | 13,753  | 25,656  | 73,216  | 39,969  | 4,886  | 3,161  | 15,520  | 2,764\n35-39  | 13,030  | 24,926  | 55,816  | 30,999  | 3,497  | 2,582  | 10,831  | 3,290\n40-44  | 16,042  | 24,602  | 38,462  | 26,786  | 3,508  | 1,605  | 7,284  | 2,603\n45-49  | 12,509  | 24,743  | 27,780  | 18,883  | 1,180  | 896  | 6,752  | 2,663\n50-54  | 12,594  | 22,360  | 20,641  | 10,810  | 891  | 582  | 5,529  | 2,522\n55-59  | 12,754  | 19,927  | 13,654  | 5,487  | 825  | 848  | 4,064  | 1,712\n60-64  | 13,832  | 14,578  | 8,006  | 2,764  | 584  | 459  | 2,135  | 1,570\n65+  | 49,043  | 31,213  | 10,033  | 3,415  | 775  | 389  | 2,886  | 702\n**Total** | **187,100** | **346,157** | **541,281** | **274,628** | **30,101** | **30,612** | **77,615** | **21,922**\n\nThe table below shows the 2018 Namibia Labour Force Survey employment\nstatistics by education.

Namibians with a\nuniversity certificate, diploma or degree have a significantly higher\nemployment rate at 76.4%, while postgraduate education holders are most likely\nto be employed with an employment rate of 83.8% in 2018.\n\n| No education  | Primary  | Junior secondary  | Senior secondary  | Technical/vocational certificate or diploma  | Currently in year 1, 2 or 3 of tertiary education  | University certificate, diploma or degree  | Postgraduate certificate, diploma or degree\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nTotal  | 187,100  | 346,157  | 541,281  | 274,628  | 30,101  | 30,612  | 77,615  | 21,922\nEmployed  | 85,352  | 146,089  | 229,259  | 146,874  | 16,292  | 12,595  | 59,328  | 18,378\n**% Employed** | **45.6%** | **42.2%** | **42.4%** | **53.5%** | **54.1%** | **41.1%** | **76.4%** | **83.8%**\n\nNamibians in the informal sector as well as in low-paid jobs like homemakers,\ngardeners or factory workers are unlikely to be covered by medical aid or a\npension fund.
