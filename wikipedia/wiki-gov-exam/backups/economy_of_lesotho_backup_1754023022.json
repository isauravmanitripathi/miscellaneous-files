    "text": "Lesotho's early economic history was shaped by its integration into the\nregional economy of Southern Africa, a heavy reliance on labor migration and\nproductivity in agriculture. In the 19th century, Lesotho was a significant\nagricultural exporter, supplying grain and mohair to South African mining\ncamps. However, by the early 20th century, worsening land shortages and\nunfavorable climate conditions shifted Lesotho into a net food importer and a\nlabor reserve for South African mines and farms. Labor migration became a\ncentral economic pillar, with tens of thousands of Basotho men seeking\nemployment in South Africa throughout the 20th century. By 1982, over 100,000\nBasotho were working in South African industries.\n\nLesotho's independence on the 4th of October 1966 marked the beginning of\nincreased international aid flows, with Britain, Sweden, and multilateral\ndonors providing financial assistance. And early aid efforts were largely\ndirected at agriculture, based on the assumption that Lesotho was a purely\nagrarian society. Large-scale rural development projects, including those\nfunded by the World Bank and USAID, repeatedly failed due to, among other\nreasons, poor planning and a lack of local participation.\n\nPolitical instability influenced aid patterns. Following a 1970 coup, British\nand Swedish aid was temporarily suspended but resumed later that year. Lesotho\nalso leveraged its opposition to apartheid to attract more aid, particularly\nafter the 1976 Soweto Uprising and Transkei border conflicts. By 1979,\ndevelopment assistance had risen to $64 million.\n\nUntil the political insecurity in September 1998, Lesotho's economy had grown\nsteadily since 1992. The riots, however, destroyed nearly 80% of commercial\ninfrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns in the country, having a\ndisastrous effect on the country's economy. Nonetheless, the country has\ncompleted several IMF Structural Adjustment Programs, and inflation declined\nsubstantially over the course of the 1990s. Lesotho's trade deficit, however,\nis quite large, with exports representing only a small fraction of imports.\n\nThe global economic crisis hit the Lesotho economy hard through loss of\ntextile exports and jobs in the sector due largely to the economic slowdown in\nthe United States which is a major export destination, reduced diamond mining\nand exports, including weak prices for diamonds; drop in SACU revenues due to\nthe economic slowdown in the South African economy, and reduction in worker\nremittances due to weakening of the South African economy and contraction of\nthe mining sector and related job losses in South Africa. In 2009, GDP growth\nslowed to 0.9 percent."

    "text": "Lesotho's progress in moving from a predominantly subsistence-oriented economy\nto a lower middle income, diversified economy exporting natural resources and\nmanufacturing goods has brought higher, more secure incomes to a significant\nportion of the population. The percentage of the population living below USD\nPPP US$1.25/day fell from 48 percent to 44 percent between 1995 and 2003. The\nunemployment rate in 2008 was 25.29% and rose to 27.2% in 2012. However, the\nunemployment rate fell to 23.06% in 2017. The percentage of the population\nliving below the poverty line fell from 58% in 2002 to 49.2% in 2017. The\ncountry is still among the \"Low Human Development\" countries (rank 155 of 192)\nas classified by the UNDP, with 42.3 years of life expectancy at birth.\nHowever, adult literacy is very high, at 82%, and children underweight aged\nunder 5 are only 20%.\n\nLesotho has received economic aid from a variety of sources, including the\nUnited States, the World Bank, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and\nGermany.\n\nLesotho has nearly 6,000 kilometers of unpaved and modern all-weather roads.\nThere is a short rail line (freight) linking Lesotho with South Africa that is\ntotally owned and operated by South Africa."

    "text": "Lesotho has taken advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)\nto become the largest exporter of garments to the US from sub-Saharan Africa.\nAmerican Brands and retailers sourcing from Lesotho include: Foot Locker, Gap,\nGloria Vanderbilt, JCPenney, Levi Strauss, Saks, Sears, Timberland and Wal-\nMart. In mid-2004 its employment reached over 50,000 mainly female workers,\nmarking the first time that manufacturing sector workers outnumbered\ngovernment employees. In 2008 it exported 487 million dollars mainly to the\nUnited States. Since 2004 employment in the sector was somehow reduced to\nabout 45,000, in mid-2011, due to intense international competition in the\ngarment sector. It was the largest formal sector employer in Lesotho in 2011.\nThe sector initiated a major program to fight HIV/AIDS, called Apparel Lesotho\nAlliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA). It is an industry-wide program providing\nprevention and treatment for the workers."

    "text": "While women are more subject to access to secondary schooling than men, men\nmake 1.5 times more income than women. Prior to the 1950s, Basotho women\nmigrated to South Africa for work due to an agricultural decline. Of those who\nmigrated, many of them were unwed and many stayed in South Africa. Married\ncouples also traveled to South Africa together for work. In 1923, the pass law\nNatives (Urban Areas) Act was passed in South Africa which required black men\nto carry passports with them at all times when in white areas for work. Women\nwere included in an amendment to the law in 1952. The amendment caused a\ndecline in migration of female labor, and by the 1970s, only 36.1% of women\nover age 39 in Lesotho had worked in South Africa. Lesotho women did not work\nin mines.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lesotho received aid to help with the manufacturing industry.\nThe main workers employed in the industry were young women. In 1990, 92% of\nemployees in the textile industry were women.\n\nAbout 86% of the female population in Lesotho works in the textile industry."

    "text": "Water and diamonds are Lesotho's only significant natural resources. Water is\nbeing extracted through the 30-year, multibillion-dollar Lesotho Highlands\nWater Project (LHWP), which was initiated in 1986. The LHWP is designed to\ncapture, store, and transfer water from the Orange River system and send it to\nSouth Africa's Free State and greater Johannesburg area, which features a\nlarge concentration of South African industry, population and agriculture. At\nthe completion of the project, Lesotho should be almost completely self-\nsufficient in the production of electricity and also gain income from the sale\nof electricity to South Africa. The World Bank, African Development Bank,\nEuropean Investment Bank, and many other bilateral donors are financing the\nproject. Diamonds are produced in Letšeng, Mothae, Liqhobong and Kao mines.\nThe sector suffered a setback in 2008 as the result of the world recession but\nrebounded in 2010 and 2011. It is a major contributor to the exports of\nLesotho."
