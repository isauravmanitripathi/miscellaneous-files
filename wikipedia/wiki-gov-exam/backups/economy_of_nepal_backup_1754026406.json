    "text": "The **economy of Nepal** is a developing category and is largely dependent on\nagriculture and remittances. Until the mid-20th century Nepal was an isolated\npre-industrial society, which entered the modern era in 1951 without schools,\nhospitals, roads, telecommunications, electric power, industry, or civil\nservice. The country has, however, made progress toward sustainable economic\ngrowth since the 1950s. The country was opened to economic liberalization,\nleading to economic growth and improvement in living standards when compared\nto the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher\neconomic development are the frequent changes in political leadership, as well\nas corruption.\n\nNepal has used a series of five-year plans in an attempt to make progress in\neconomic development. It completed its ninth economic development plan in\n2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have\nbeen privatised. Foreign aid to Nepal accounts for more than half of the\ndevelopment budget. Government priorities over the years have been result in\nthe development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture,\nand industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural\ndevelopment efforts have been emphasised. The economy is heavily dependent on\nimports of basic materials and on foreign markets for its forest and\nagricultural products. Nepal possesses immense potential for sustainable\nenergy resources that can be harnessed for energy security, economic growth,\nand environmental sustainability.\n\nAgriculture remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65%\nof the population and providing 31.7% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area\nis cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland\nand forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples,\npears, tomatoes, various salad greens, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as\nrice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an\nagricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.\n\nGDP is heavily dependent on remittances (9.1%) of foreign workers.\nSubsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in\nNepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system\nis under development, and Tribhuvan University has several campuses under it .\nAlthough eradication efforts continue, malaria had been controlled in the\nfertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. Kathmandu is\nlinked to India and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway\nnetwork. The capital was almost out of fuel and supplies, due to a crippling\ngeneral strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.\n\nMajor towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air\nservices. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries like pasmina have\ngrown rapidly in recent years. Together, they account for approximately 70% of\nthe country's merchandise exports. The Cost of Living Index in Nepal is\ncomparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life\nhas declined to a much less desirous value in recent years. In the 2021 Global\nHunger Index, Nepal ranks 76th out of the 116 countries with sufficient data\nto calculate 2021 GHI scores. With a score of 19.1, Nepal has a level of\nhunger that is moderate. Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia.\nWorld Economics estimates Nepal's 2024 GDP at $243 billion in PPP terms\n(Purchasing Power Parity) and an initial estimate of $255 billion for 2025.\nThis figure is 65% higher than the official estimate published by the World\nBank.",
