Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( November 2024)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Burkina Faso** is based primarily on subsistence farming and\nlivestock raising. Burkina Faso has an average income purchasing-power-parity\nper capita of $1,900 and nominal per capita of $790 in 2014. More than 80% of\nthe population relies on subsistence agriculture with only a small fraction\ndirectly involved in industry and services. Highly variable rainfall, poor\nsoils, lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure, a low\nliteracy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this\nlandlocked country. The export economy also remained subject to fluctuations\nin world prices.\n\nThe country has a high population density, few natural resources, and a\nfragile soil. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled\ncorporations.[_citation needed_] Following the African franc currency\ndevaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in\nconjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have\nincreased. Maintenance of its macroeconomic progress depends on continued low\ninflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage\nprivate investment.\n\nThe Burkinabé financial system represents 30% of the country's GDP and is\ndominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial\nsystem assets. Eleven banks and five non-bank financial institutions operate\nin the country.\n\nThe banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks\nholding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally\nadequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the\ncotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.\n\nA December 2018 report from the World Bank indicates that cotton had become\nthe most important cash crop, while gold exports were increasing in recent\nyears. In 2017, economic growth increased to 6.4% in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016)\nprimarily due to gold production and increased investment in infrastructure.\nThe increase in consumption linked to growth of the wage bill also supported\neconomic growth. Inflation remained low, 0.4% that year but the public deficit\ngrew to 7.7% of GDP (vs. 3.5% in 2016). The government was continuing to get\nfinancial aid and loans to finance the debt. To finance the public deficit,\nthe Government combined concessional aid and borrowing on the regional market.\nThe World Bank said that the economic outlook remained favorable in the short\nand medium term, although that could be negatively impacted. Risks included\nhigh oil prices (imports), lower prices of gold and cotton (exports) as well\nas terrorist threat and labour strikes.",

Mean wages were $0.56 per man-hour in 2009.\n\nBurkinabé exports in 2006\n\nCurrent GDP per capita of Burkina Faso grew 13% in the Sixties reaching a peak\ngrowth of 237% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth\nconsequently scaled back to 23% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37% in\nthe Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.\n\nAlthough disadvantaged by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy,\nBurkina Faso remains committed to the structural adjustment program it\nlaunched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in\nJanuary 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9%.\n\nMany Burkinabé migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their\nremittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments.\nBurkina Faso is attempting to improve the economy by developing its mineral\nresources, improving its infrastructure, making its agricultural and livestock\nsectors more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and\nprices of cereals.\n\nThe agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in\nrainfall. The Mossi Plateau in north central Burkina Faso faces encroachment\nfrom the Sahara. The resultant southward migration means heightened\ncompetition for control of very limited water resources south of the Mossi\nPlateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers,\nliving with problems of climate, soil erosion, and rudimentary technology. The\nstaple crops are pearl millet, sorghum, maize, and rice. The cash crops are\ncotton, groundnuts, karite (shea nuts), and sesame. Livestock, once a major\nexport, has declined.\n\nA 2018 report by the African Development Bank Group discussed a macroeconomic\nevolution: \"higher investment and continued spending on social services and\nsecurity that will add to the budget deficit\". This group's prediction for\n2018 indicated that the budget deficit would be reduced to 4.8% of GDP in 2018\nand to 2.9% in 2019. Public debt associated with the National Economic and\nSocial Development Plan was estimated at 36.9% of GDP in 2017.",
