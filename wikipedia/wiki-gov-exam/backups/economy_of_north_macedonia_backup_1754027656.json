Prior to independence, North Macedonia was\nYugoslavia's poorest republic (only 5% of the total federal output of goods\nand services). An absence of infrastructure, United Nations sanctions on its\nlargest market (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), and a Greek economic\nembargo hindered economic growth until 1996.\n\nWorker remittances and foreign aid have softened the subsequent volatile\nrecovery period. The country's GDP has increased each year except in 2001,\nrising by 5% in 2000. However, growth in 1999 was held down by the severe\nregional economic dislocations caused by the Kosovo War.\n\nSuccessful privatization in 2000 boosted the country's reserves to over $700\nmillion. Also, the leadership demonstrated a continuing commitment to economic\nreform, free trade, and regional integration. The economy can meet its basic\nfood needs, and its coal and hydroelectric power needs, but depends on outside\nsources for all of its petroleum, natural gas, and most of its modern\nmachinery and parts. Inflation jumped to 11% in 2000 largely due to higher oil\nprices,[_citation needed_] but the currency has calmed since the exchange rate\nwas normalised when the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement entered\ninto force in 2004."

It concentrated on pasture farming and vineyard\ngrowing. Opium poppy, introduced into the region in 1835, became an important\ncrop as well by the late 19th century, and remained so until the 1930s.\n\nThe role of industry in the region's economy increased during the industrial\nage. The geographical region of Macedonia was responsible for large outputs of\ntextiles and several other goods in the Ottoman Empire. However, outdated\ntechniques to produce the goods persisted. The stagnation of the regional\neconomy began under the rule of the Kingdom of Serbia.[_citation needed_]\n\nWhen World War II ended, the local economy began to experience revitalization\nby way of subsidies from Federal Belgrade. The subsidies assisted North\nMacedonia to redevelop its \"lost\" industry and shift its agricultural-centered\neconomy to an industry-centered economy with new hearts of industry emerging\nall over the country in Veles, Bitola, Štip and Kumanovo. Previously, Skopje\nwas the only industrial centre in North Macedonia, this expanded to several\nother cities during Socialist Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the fall of Socialist Yugoslavia, the economy experienced several shocks\nthat damaged the local economy. Starting with the Western embargo on the\nYugoslavian common market, and ending with the Greek embargo on Macedonia over\nthe Macedonia naming dispute.[_citation needed_] The economy began to recover\nin 1995 and experienced a full recovery after the 2001 insurgency by ethnic\nAlbanians. Macedonia's GDP grew by an average of 6% annually until the 2008\nfinancial crisis, when its economy contracted. The crisis had little impact on\nthe country. North Macedonia today maintains a low debt-to-GDP ratio and is\nexperiencing a revitalized investment interest by companies from Turkey,\nAlgeria, Albania, and others."

    "text": "Pelagonija, breadbasket region of North Macedonia.\n\nNorth Macedonia is vulnerable to economic developments in Europe - due to\nstrong banking and trade ties - and dependent on regional integration and\nprogress toward EU membership for continued economic growth. At independence\nin September 1991, North Macedonia was the least developed of the Yugoslav\nrepublics, producing a mere 5% of the total federal output of goods and\nservices. The collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ended\ntransfer payments from the central government and eliminated advantages from\ninclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence of infrastructure, UN\nsanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a\ndispute about the country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic\ngrowth until 1996.[_citation needed_] Since then, North Macedonia has\nmaintained macroeconomic stability with low inflation, but it has so far\nlagged the region in attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite\nmaking extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment\nremains high at 24.6% (2015, Q4), but may be overstated based on the existence\nof an extensive gray market that is not captured by official statistics. In\nthe wake of the global economic downturn, North Macedonia has experienced\ndecreased foreign direct investment, lowered credit availability, and a large\ntrade deficit. However, as a result of conservative fiscal policies and a\nsound financial system, in 2010 the country credit rating improved slightly to\nBB+ and was kept at that level in 2011. Macroeconomic stability has been\nmaintained by a prudent monetary policy, which keeps the domestic currency\npegged against the euro. As a result, GDP growth was modest, but positive, in\n2010 and 2011, and inflation was under control. Latest data from North\nMacedonia's State Statistical Office show that overall, output for 2012\ndropped by 6.6 percent compared to 2011.\n\nAs of 2020, the country had signed free trade agreements with the Central\nEuropean Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), the Stabilisation and Association\nAgreement with the European Union, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)\nwith Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, and bilateral agreements\nwith Turkey and Ukraine."

Following a 1997 cooperation agreement with the EU, North Macedonia\nsigned a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in April 2001,\ngiving North Macedonia duty-free access to European markets. In December 2005,\nit moved a step forward, obtaining candidate country status for EU accession.\nNorth Macedonia has had a foreign trade deficit since 1994, which reached a\nrecord high of $2.873 billion in 2008, or 30.2% of GDP. Total trade in 2010\n(imports plus exports of goods and services) was $8.752 billion, and the trade\ndeficit amounted to $2.149 billion, or 23.4% of GDP. In the first 8 months of\n2011, total trade was $7.470 billion and the trade deficit was $1.778 billion.\nA significant 56.5% of North Macedonia's total trade was with EU countries.\nNorth Macedonia's major trading partners are Germany, Greece, Serbia,\nBulgaria, Russia, and Italy. In 2010, total trade between North Macedonia and\nthe United States was $116.6 million, and in the first 8 months of 2011 it was\n$65 million. U.S. meat, mainly poultry, and electrical machinery and equipment\nhave been particularly attractive to North Macedonia importers. Principal\nexports from North Macedonia to the United States are tobacco, apparel, iron,\nand steel.\n\nNorth Macedonia has bilateral free trade agreements with Ukraine, Turkey, and\nthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA—Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and\nLiechtenstein). Bilateral agreements with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nCroatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Moldova were replaced by membership\nin the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).

Many\npeople lost their jobs with the collapse of Yugoslavia. As a result, national\nunemployment was above 35% (37.30% in 2005), but that number has since dropped\nto 16.6% (2019), with population below the poverty line also dropping from\n30.4% (2011) to 21.5% (2015), it is reasonable to assume that based on the\ntrend over the past few years, further declines are likely for both\nunemployment and poverty. Full-time employment has risen steadily over the\nlast few years, with part-time employment trending slightly downward over the\nsame period resulting in an overall increase to employment, wages increased\nsharply after 2008, with steady increases continuing into 2016"

    "text": "Real GDP in the first half of 2011 increased by 5.2%. This robust growth was\nmainly driven by 23.6% growth in the construction sector; 13.2% in mining,\nquarrying, and manufacturing; 12.4% in wholesale and retail trade; and 4.2% in\ntransport and communication services. Industrial output in the first 8 months\nof 2011 was 7.5% higher than in the same period of 2010. Low public and\nexternal debt and a comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves allowed for\nfurther relaxation of monetary policy, with the reference interest rate of the\nCentral Bank decreasing to 4%. Due to rising prices for energy, fuel, and food\non international markets, inflation increased in the first half of 2011, but\nlater decreased to an annualized rate of 3.4% at the end of September. The\nofficial unemployment rate dropped to 24.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, but\nremained one of the highest in Europe. Many people work in the gray economy,\nand many experts estimate North Macedonia's actual unemployment is lower.\n\nThe government budget has generally kept within projections. The budget\ndeficit at the end of August 2011 reached about 2% of GDP, and fiscal\nauthorities seemed committed to keeping it under the projected target of 2.5%\nof GDP by the end of the year. In addition to 220 million euros (approx. $298\nmillion) drawn from an IMF Precautionary Credit Line (PCL) in March, financing\nmostly came from domestic borrowing. However, by the end of the year a\nfinancing gap remained of about 50 million to 60 million euros (approx. $67\nmillion to $81 million), which the government plans to cover by borrowing from\ninternational capital markets, supported by a policy-based guarantee by the\nWorld Bank. The central government's public debt remained low at 26% of GDP,\nbut represents a gradual increase from previous years. Despite lowering the\nCentral Bank bills rate, the Central Bank has not changed liquidity indicators\nfor banks or the reserve requirement since 2009, curbing credit growth to 7.5%\nin the first three-quarters of 2011. Nikola Gruevski says the government will\npay off its entire debt to the private sector by February 2013 in order to\nimprove the economy's overall liquidity. North Macedonia's external trade\nstruggled in 2010 due to the slow recovery from the economic crisis of its\nmain trading partners, particularly EU members. Starting from a very low base,\nexport growth in the first 8 months of 2011 reached 41.7%, topping import\ngrowth of 36.8%. The trade deficit has widened to 18.3% of GDP, approaching\nthe end-year target of 21.9% of GDP. At the same time, the current account\nbalance deficit significantly improved and the end-year projection was revised\nupward to 5.5% of GDP. This was due primarily to a 4.4% higher inflow of\ncurrent transfers, mostly during the summer, and came despite a poor level of\nforeign direct investment (FDI) of only $237.2 million by end-July 2011.\nForeign currency reserves remained at about $2.6 billion, a level that\ncomfortably covers 4 months of imports and about 110% of the country's short-\nterm debt.\n\nIn October 2010, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a new Country\nPartnership Strategy (CPS) with North Macedonia for the period 2011–2014. This\nCPS will provide the country assistance of about $100 million in funding for\nthe first 2 years to improve competitiveness, strengthen employability and\nsocial protection, and increase the use of sustainable energy. This assistance\nalso includes a commitment of $30 million in direct budget support in the form\nof a policy-based guarantee by the World Bank to the government to facilitate\nits access to financing from international capital markets, a process that had\nbeen started as of November 2011.\n\nNorth Macedonia became the first country eligible for the IMF's Precautionary\nCredit Line in January 2011. This program gives North Macedonia a line of\ncredit worth 475 million euros (about $675 million) over 2 years, intended to\nbe accessed only in case of need brought about by external shocks. The credit\nline was approved after extensive consultations with the IMF in October and\nDecember 2010. The IMF expects that there will be no additional withdrawals\nfrom the PCL.\n\nNorth Macedonia has the best economic freedom in the region, according to the\n2012 Index of Economic Freedom, released in January, 2012 by the conservative\nU.S. think tank Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal."
