    "text": "In September 2002, the government announced a 20-year development plan. Among\nother things, it aimed to give indigenous Fijians a greater stake in the\neconomy. The plan envisages tax-relief to businesses owned or managed by\nethnic Fijians, along with greater protection for indigenous land and fishery\nrights.\n\nA major aim of the Fijian government is to achieve self-sufficiency in rice\nproduction. Cattle farming, fishing, and forestry (especially pine trees) are\nbeing encouraged to diversify the economy; the leading manufacturing\nindustries involve the processing of primary products. On 14 April 2005, the\nCabinet approved Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's proposal to develop a\nbiofuels industry. Under the plan, ethanol is to be developed as a complement\nto the sugar industry, with the hope of alleviating Fiji's dependence on\nimported fossil fuel such as petrol.\n\nOn 15 August, Qarase said that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\nhad granted assistance to Fiji to develop its biofuels project. Transformation\nof the Fiji Sugar Corporation into an energy and sugar company would result in\na turnover of F$1 billion by 2025, he said, and would cut imports of crude\noil, generate export earnings, and provide a source of electricity. Energy\ncould be produced from copra, forest, and agricultural products, as well as\nsugar. He touted the scheme as necessary for diversifying and strengthening\nthe sugar industry for its own survival, as well as for the national economy.\nHe said that the government of India had loaned F$86 million for upgrading of\nFiji's sugar mills, which would be completed in time for the 2007-2008\ncrushing season.\n\nOn 28 December 2005, John Teiwa of the Coconut Industry Development Authority\nannounced that a 20-year plan for the coconut industry would be launched in\n2006. Financing from international investors, including the government of\nIndia, would be sought to develop processing of virgin and extra virgin\ncoconut oil, with a view to venturing into foreign health markets. The\ngovernment expected an annual profit of F$120 million from the venture, Fiji\nVillage reported. Trials for the generation of fuel from coconut oil were also\nin progress, Teiwa said.",

Over\n62,000 of the tourists were American, a number that had steadily increased\nsince the start of regularly scheduled non-stop air service from Los Angeles.\nTourism earned more than $300 million in foreign exchange for Fiji in 1998, an\namount exceeding the revenue from its two largest goods exports (sugar and\ngarments).[_citation needed_]\n\nThe effects of the Asian financial crisis led to a sharp drop in the number of\nAsian tourists visiting Fiji in 1997 and 1998, which contributed to a\nsubstantial drop in gross domestic product. Positive growth returned in 1999,\nhowever, aided by a 20% devaluation of the Fijian dollar. 2005 was a record\nyear for the tourism sector, with 9% growth according to Viliame Gavoka, Chief\nExecutive of the Fiji Visitors Bureau.[_citation needed_]"

Imports in 1998 accounted for\nUS$721 million, and exports for US$510 million, resulting in a US$116 million\ndeficit. Tourism revenue yields services surplus, however, which keeps the\ncurrent account of its balance of payments roughly in balance ($13 million in\n1998). Australia accounts for between 35% and 45% of Fiji's trade, with New\nZealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan varying year-by-year\nbetween 5% and 15% each.\n\nFoodstuffs, machinery, mineral fuels, beverages, tobacco, and manufactured\ngoods are the principal imports. The two largest exports are sugar and\ngarments, which each accounted for approximately one-quarter of export revenue\nin 1998 (roughly $122 million each). The sugar industry suffered in 1997 due\nto low world prices and rent disputes between farmers and landowners, and\nagain in 1998 from drought, but recovered in 1999.\n\nThe Fijian garment industry has developed rapidly since the introduction of\ntax exemptions in 1988. The industry's output has increased nearly tenfold\nsince that time. Fish, lumber, molasses, coconut oil and ginger are also\nimportant exports, although the last two are in decline. Forestry became\nimportant as an export trade in the mid-1980s, when the pine plantations\nplanted in the 1950s and 1960s began to mature. They sell much fish.\n\nAustralia's Trade Commissioner Ross Bray revealed on 26 January 2006 that\nFiji's exports to Australia are achieving an annual growth rate of 5%. More\nthan 31,000 Australian companies were trading in the Pacific, half of them in\nFiji, Bray said. Fiji is progressing very rapidly."

    "text": "Since 1987, when the country was destabilized by two military coups, Fiji has\nsuffered a very high rate of emigration, particularly of skilled and\nprofessional personnel. More than 70,000 people left the country in the\naftermath of the coups, majority of whom were Indo-Fijians. With the\ncontinuing expiration of land leases and ongoing instability in the aftermath\nof another coup in 2000, a further outflow of skilled workers has taken place.\n\nA report in 2004 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment, published on 29 June 2005, found that 61% of Fiji's skilled\nworkers have either emigrated or gone abroad as guestworkers. Fiji's loss of\nskilled workers was the world's fourth highest, behind Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti,\nand Trinidad and Tobago. Fiji's Bureau of Statistics recorded 3595 workers as\nhaving left the country between January and August 2004. Of these, 414 held\nprofessional or technical jobs, 263 were in administrative or managerial\npositions, and were clerks, supervisors, or related workers, and 118 were\nsales workers.\n\nFiji's economy is increasingly reliant on remittances from citizens working\noverseas. Personal remittances now run to more than F$200 million a year,\nearning more than traditional sectors like sugar and garment manufacturing.\nRecruitment of Fijians by foreign private military companies is a growing\nsource of revenue. By mid-2005, there were over 1,000 Fijians working in Iraq\nand Kuwait as soldiers, security guards, drivers and labourers. In addition in\n2006 there were more than 2,000 Fijian soldiers in the British Army, and in\n2004 the British defence ministry even sent recruiting teams to Fiji to do\ninitial fitness and aptitude tests, cutting the costs of selection for poor\nFijian villagers who could not afford to fly to London to sign up."

However, the leasehold system is often misunderstood.\n\nLeasehold tenure has not been a problem for the property sector. Houses all\nover Fiji on communally owned land are on 99-year leases, which have proved\nsatisfactory as a basis for house ownership. Hotels also enjoy 99-year leases.\nThe prestigious Denarau development involving major hotels and resorts and\nluxury properties is situated on communally owned land. It delivers\nsignificant income to native owners and secure title to developers and their\ncustomers.\n\nIn agricultural sector, there have been problems even though agricultural\nleases are mandated at 30 years, following the extension by legislation (the\nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act or ALTA) of all ten-year leases to thirty\nyears in 1977. The problem experienced in agriculture is the non-renewal\nleases as landowners have been unhappy with the provisions in the ALTA for\nindexing of rents to cope with inflation. That is an ongoing problem which\ncalls for urgent attention."
