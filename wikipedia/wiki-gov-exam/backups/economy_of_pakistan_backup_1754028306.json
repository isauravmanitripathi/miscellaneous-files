It ranks as\nthe 26th-largest based on GDP using purchasing power parity (PPP) and the 44th\nlargest in terms of nominal GDP. With a population of 254.4 million people as\nof 2024, Pakistan's position at per capita income ranks 160th by GDP (nominal)\nand 141st by GDP (PPP) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nIn its early years, Pakistan's economy relied heavily on private industries.\nThe nationalization of a significant portion of the sector, including\nfinancial services, manufacturing, and transportation, began in the early\n1970s under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. During Zia-ul Haq's regime in the 1980s, an\n\"Islamic\" economy was adopted, outlawing economic practices forbidden in\nSharīʿah and mandating traditional religious practices.

In recent\ndecades, regional connectivity initiatives such as the China-Pakistan Economic\nCorridor (CPEC) have emerged as pivotal contributors to infrastructure and\nenergy development, with long-term implications for economic stability.\nPakistan was classified as a semi-industrial economy for the first time in the\nlate 1990s, albeit an underdeveloped country with a heavy dependence on\nagriculture, particularly the textile industry relying on cotton production.\nPrimary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports equipment,\nchemicals, and carpets/rugs.\n\nPakistan is presently undergoing economic liberalization, including the\nprivatization of all government corporations, aimed at attracting foreign\ninvestment and reducing budget deficits. However, the country continues to\ngrapple with challenges such as rapid population growth, widespread\nilliteracy, political instability, hostile neighbors and heavy foreign debt.",

The public\ndebt/revenues ratio surged to 624%, and the interest payments/revenues ratio\nreached 42.6%, rendering Pakistan's public debt unsustainable. Concerns over\nexternal debt default emerged in 1996 and 1998, triggered by Western economic\nsanctions in response to Pakistan's nuclear tests in May 1998, causing massive\ncapital flight.\n\nDespite these challenges, Pakistan managed to sustain an agricultural growth\nrate of 4.4% per annum and a large-scale manufacturing growth rate of 4.8% per\nannum throughout the 1990s. However, the era witnessed a significant increase\nin poverty incidence, reaching 30.6% in 1998–99. The decade encapsulated a\ncomplex economic narrative, as Pakistan navigated external debt burdens,\nfiscal imbalances, inflation, and rising unemployment. Amid these\ndifficulties, there were positive aspects, including growth in key sectors\nlike agriculture and manufacturing. Nonetheless, the 1990s also brought forth\na looming threat of debt default, magnified by economic sanctions in response\nto nuclear tests.",

    "text": "PTCL's One Stop Shop in Islamabad\n\nAfter the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, the sector has\nexperienced exponential growth. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL)\nhas emerged as a successful Forbes 2000 conglomerate with over US$1 billion in\nsales in 2005. The mobile telephone market has expanded many-fold since 2003,\nreaching a subscriber base of 140 million users in July 2017, one of the\nhighest mobile teledensities in the world. Pakistan won the prestigious\nGovernment Leadership award of GSM Association in 2006.\n\nIn Pakistan, the following are the top mobile phone operators:\n\n1. Jazz Pakistan (parent: VEON, Netherlands)\n2. Ufone (parent: PTCL (Etisalat), Pakistan/UAE)\n3. Telenor (parent: Telenor, Norway)\n4. Zong (parent: China Mobile, China)\n\nBy March 2009, Pakistan had 91 million mobile subscribers – 25 million more\nsubscribers than reported in the same period in 2008. In addition to the 3.1\nmillion fixed lines, as many as 2.4 million are using Wireless Local Loop\nconnections. Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Motorola along with Samsung and LG\nremain the most popular brands among customers.\n\nSince liberalisation, over the past four years from 2003 to 2007, the\nPakistani telecom sector has attracted more than $9 billion in foreign\ninvestments. During 2007–08, the Pakistani communication sector alone received\n$1.62 billion in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) – about 30% of the country's\ntotal foreign direct investment.\n\nAccording to the PC World, a total of 6.37 billion text messages were sent\nthrough Acision messaging systems across Asia Pacific over the 2008/2009\nChristmas and New Year period. Pakistan was amongst the top five rankers with\none of the highest SMS traffic with 763 million messages.\n\nOn 14 August 2010, Pakistan became the first country in the world to\nexperience EVDO's RevB 3G technology that offers maximum speeds of 9.3 Mbit/s.\n\n3G and 4G were simultaneously launched in Pakistan on 23 April 2014 through a\nSMRA auction. Three out of five companies got a 3G licence i.e. Ufone,\nMobilink and Telenor while China Mobile's Zong got 3G as well as a 4G licence.\nWhereas the fifth company, Warid Pakistan did not participate in the auction\nprocedure, but they launched 4G LTE services on their existing 2G 1800 MHz\nspectrum due to Technology-neutral terms and became the world's first Telecom\nCompany to transform directly from 2G to 4G. With that, Pakistan joined the 3G\nand 4G world. In December 2017, 3G and 4G subscribers in Pakistan reached 46\nmillion.\n\nAfter the successful implementation of the Device Identification Registration\nand Blocking System (DIRBS) in 2019 along with a comprehensive mobile\nmanufacturing policy, it created a favourable environment for mobile device\nmanufacturing in Pakistan. For the first time in the history of Pakistan,\nlocal mobile phone manufacturing exceeded the number of mobile phones that\nwere imported in 2021. Mobile device manufacturing licences have been issued\nto 26 companies, including Samsung, Redmi, Realme, Nokia, Oppo, TECNO,\nInfinix, Itel, Vgotel, and Q-Mobile.\n\nPTA reports  Indicators  | 2003  | 2004  | 2005  | 2006  | 2007  | 2017  | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  | 2023  | 2024\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nTeledensity | 4.31%  | 6.25%  | 11.9%  | 26.24%  | 44.06%  | 72.4%  | 74.1%  | 75.1%  | 76.3%  | 81.7%  | 84.6%  | 81.4%  | 80.5%\nTelecom subscribers (millions)  | 2.4  | 5.0  | 12.7  | 34.5  | 62.3  | 139.8  | 151.5  | 165.0  | 171.1  | 186.8  | 197.2  | 193.5  | 195.1\nBroadband subscribers (millions)  | 0.03  | 0.05  | 44.8  | 58.7  | 71.5  | 83.8  | 102.7  | 118.8  | 127.6  | 138.3\nBroadband penetration  | 0.0%  | 0.0%  | 22.7%  | 28.1%  | 32.6%  | 37.4%  | 44.9%  | 51.0%  | 53.6%  | 57.0%\nCellular mobile data usage (petabytes)  | 690  | 1,262  | 2,493  | 4,510  | 6,853  | 8,970  | 10,850  | 13,021\nTelecom revenues (billion PKR)  | 118  | 144  | 195  | 236  | 528  | 540  | 604  | 595  | 641  | 717  | 817  | 955\nTelecom contribution to exchequer (billion PKR)  | 30.0  | 38  | 67  | 77  | 100  | 161  | 163  | 111  | 286  | 222  | 329  | 341  | 335\nTotal telecom investment (million US $)  | 1,473  | 1,731  | 4,109  | 1,133  | 1,132  | 882  | 1,140  | 1,214  | 1,657  | 770  | 765\nMobile (CBU) imports (million units)  | 18.11  | 12.07  | 16.28  | 24.51  | 10.26  | 1.53  | 1.58  | 1.71\nLocal assembly / manufacturing (million units)  | 1.72  | 5.2  | 11.74  | 13.05  | 24.66  | 21.94  | 21.28  | 31.38",

Nevertheless, the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and\nIndustry estimated in late 2006 that the overall production of housing units\nin Pakistan has to be increased to 0.5 million units annually to address 6.1\nmillion backlog of housing in Pakistan for meeting the housing shortfall in\nnext 20 years. The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly\naging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years\nold. It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums\nand squatter settlements. The report said that meeting the backlog in housing,\nbesides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial\nresources of the government. This necessitates putting in place a framework to\nfacilitate financing in the formal private sector and mobilise non-government\nresources for a market-based housing finance system. To promote affordable\nhousing and home ownership among low to middle-income group, who currently do\nnot own a house, SBP in 2020 introduced the Government's Mark-Up Subsidy\nScheme, through which subsidized financing is provided to individuals for\nconstruction or purchase of a new house.

The\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank\n(ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives\nbilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. Foreign aid has been one\nof the main sources of money for the Pakistani economy. Collection of foreign\naid has been one of the priorities of almost every Pakistani Government with\nthe Prime Minister himself leading delegations on a regular basis to collect\nforeign aid.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank will provide close to $6 billion development\nassistance to Pakistan during 2006–9. The World Bank unveiled a lending\nprogramme of up to $6.5 billion for Pakistan under a new four-year, 2006–2009,\naid strategy showing a significant increase in funding aimed largely at\nbeefing up the country's infrastructure. Japan will provide $500 million\nannual economic aid to Pakistan. In November 2008, the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) has approved a loan of 7.6 billion to Pakistan, to help stabilise\nand rebuild the country's economy. Between the 2008 and 2010 fiscal years, the\nIMF extended loans to Pakistan totalling 5.2 billion dollars. The government\ndecided in 2011 to cut off ties with the IMF. However, the government newly\nelected in 2013 re-established these ties, and a negotiated a three-year $6.6\nbillion package which would allow it to deal with ongoing debt issues. In May\n2019, Pakistan finalised a US$6 billion foreign aid with IMF. This is\nPakistan's 22nd such bailout from the IMF.\n\nThe China–Pakistan Economic Corridor is being developed with a contribution of\nmainly concessionary loans from China under the Belt and Road Initiative. Much\nlike BRI, the value of CPEC investments transcends any fiat currency and is\nonly estimated vaguely as it spans over decades of past and future industrial\ndevelopment and global economic influence."

    "text": "The remittances of Pakistanis living abroad have played an important role in\nPakistan's economy and foreign exchange reserves. Pakistanis settled in\nWestern Europe and North America are significant sources of remittances to\nPakistan. Since 1973, Pakistani workers in the oil-rich Arab states have been\nsources of billions of dollars of remittances.\n\nThe 9 million-strong Pakistani diaspora contributed US$19.3 billion to the\neconomy in FY2017. The major source countries of remittances to Pakistan\ninclude UAE, US, Saudi Arabia, GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait,\nQatar, and Oman), Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, UK, and EU\ncountries.\n\nRemittances sent home by overseas Pakistani workers saw a negative growth of\n3.0% in the fiscal year 2017 compared to the previous year when remittances\nreached an all-time high of 19.9 billion US dollars. This decline in\nremittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions in Arabian and\nGulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, recent\ndevelopment activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's\nimplementation of its Vision 2030, and particularly the recent visit of the PM\nto Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these\ncountries. Going forward, one can expect improvements in the coming years. The\nSBP's data showed that remittances amounted to $29.4 billion for the year\n2021. The government and SBP took measures to incentivise the use of formal\nchannels of sending money home. The orderly foreign exchange market conditions\nalso contributed to the rise in remittances. Remittances helped improve the\ncountry's external sector position despite the challenging global economic\nconditions due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nData is taken from SBP and Ministry of Finance.\n\n**Amounts are in billion US$**.

Due to the adverse effects of corruption on\nthe country, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was established in 1999.\nThe primary purpose of NAB was to recover looted money from corrupt elements\nand deposit it in the national exchequer. From 2018 to 2020, NAB recovered Rs\n502 billion from corrupt elements, a record achievement. Since the bureau's\ninception, NAB has recovered Rs 814 billion directly or indirectly from\ncorrupt elements, exceeding the recovery of other such anti-corruption\norganizations."
