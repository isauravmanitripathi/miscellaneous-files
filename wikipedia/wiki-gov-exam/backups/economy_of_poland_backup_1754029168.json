    "text": "The **economy of Poland** is an emerging and developing, high-income,\nindustrialized mixed economy that serves as the sixth-largest in the European\nUnion by nominal GDP and fifth-largest by GDP (PPP). Poland boasts the\nextensive public services characteristic of most developed economies and is\none of few countries in Europe to provide no tuition fees for undergraduate\nand postgraduate education and with universal public healthcare that is free\nat a point of use. Since 1988, Poland has pursued a policy of economic\nliberalisation but retained an advanced public welfare system. It ranks 19th\nworldwide in terms of GDP (PPP), 20th in terms of GDP (nominal), and 21st in\nthe 2023 Economic Complexity Index. Among OECD nations, Poland has a highly\nefficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at\nroughly 22.7% of GDP.\n\nThe largest component of Poland's economy is the service sector (62.3%),\nfollowed by industry (34.2%) and agriculture (3.5%). Following the economic\nreform of 1989, Poland's external debt has increased from $42.2 billion in\n1989 to $365.2 billion in 2014. Poland shipped US$224.6 billion worth of goods\naround the globe in 2017, while exports increased to US$221.4 billion. The\ncountry's top export goods include machinery, electronic equipment, vehicles,\nfurniture, and plastics. Poland was the only economy in the EU to avoid a\nrecession during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAs of 2019, the Polish economy had been growing steadily for 28 years, a\nrecord high in the EU. This record was only surpassed by Australia in the\nworld economy. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity has grown on average\nby 6% p.a. over the last 20 years, the highest in Central Europe. Poland's GDP\nhas increased seven-fold since 1990. Poland's nominal GDP has increased by\n500% since 2000.",

    "text": "The Polish state steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization\nthroughout the 1990s, with positive results for economic growth but negative\nresults for some sectors of the population. The privatization of small and\nmedium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has\nencouraged the development of the private business sector, which has been the\nmain drive for Poland's economic growth. The agricultural sector remained\nconstrained by structural problems, surplus labour, inefficient small farms,\nand a lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization of \"sensitive\nsectors\" (e.g. coal), has also been slow, but foreign investments in energy\nand steel have begun to turn the tide. Also, reforms in healthcare, education,\nthe pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than\nexpected fiscal pressures. Improving this account deficit and tightening\nmonetary policy, with a focus on inflation, are priorities for the Polish\ngovernment. Further progress in public finance depends mainly on the reduction\nof public sector employment, and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate\nfarmers, who currently pay significantly lower taxes than other people with\nsimilar income levels.\n\nEstimated historical development of real GDP per capita in Poland (1400–2022)",

      "• The restructuring and privatization of \"sensitive sectors,\" such as coal mining, progressed slowly; however, increasing foreign investment in the energy and steel industries began to positively influence these sectors' performance.",
      "• Comprehensive reforms implemented in healthcare, education, the pension system, and state administration generated fiscal pressures that exceeded initial expectations, complicating public finance management.",
      "• The Polish government prioritized addressing the current account deficit and implemented tighter monetary policies focused on controlling inflation to stabilize the economy.",
      "• Achieving further improvements in public finances largely depended on reducing public sector employment and reforming the tax code, particularly by integrating farmers—who paid substantially lower taxes than individuals with comparable incomes—into the taxation system.",

    "text": "With the collapse of the ruble-based COMECON trade bloc in 1991, Poland\nreoriented its trade. As early as 1996, 70% of its trade was with EU members.\nNeighbouring Germany is Poland's main trading partner today. Poland joined the\nEuropean Union in May 2004. Before that, it fostered regional integration and\ntrade through the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which\nincluded Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\nPoland is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. As a member of\nthe European Union, it applies the common external tariff to goods from other\ncountries including the United States. Poland's major imports are capital\ngoods needed for industrial retooling and for manufacturing inputs. The\ncountry's exports also include machinery but are highly diversified. The most\nsuccessful exports are furniture, foods, motor boats, light planes, hardwood\nproducts, casual clothing, shoes, and cosmetics. Germany is by far the biggest\nimporter of Poland's exports as of 2013. In the agricultural sector, the\nbiggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate,\ndairy products, meats, and specialty breads, with the exchange rate conducive\nto export growth. Food exports amounted to 62 billion złoty in 2011,\nincreasing by 17% from 2010. Most Polish exports to the U.S. receive tariff\nbenefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) program. Poland\nranks in the top 20 in the world both in terms of exports and imports,\nrecording a clear trade surplus.\n\nTop 20 trading partners for Poland in 2021 (millions of EUR)  Rank | Country | Total Trade | Exports | Imports\n---|---|---|---|---\n1 |  Germany |  143,450 |  82,860 |  60,590\n2 |  China |  45,912 |  3,062 |  42,850\n3 |  Italy |  27,977 |  13,362 |  14,615\n4 |  France |  26,214 |  16,532 |  9,682\n5 |  Czechia |  26,181 |  17,042 |  9,139\n6 |  Russia |  24,999 |  7,998 |  17,001\n7 |  Netherlands |  24,502 |  12,518 |  11,984\n8 |  United Kingdom |  18,954 |  14,402 |  4,552\n9 |  United States |  16,543 |  7,626 |  8,917\n10 |  Belgium |  14,273 |  7,133 |  7,140\n11 |  Spain |  13,575 |  7,285 |  6,290\n12 |  Slovakia |  12,849 |  7,398 |  5,451\n13 |  Sweden |  12,841 |  8,036 |  4,805\n14 |  Hungary |  11,591 |  7,189 |  4,402\n15 |  Austria |  11,053 |  6,499 |  4,554\n16 |  Ukraine |  10,517 |  6,270 |  4,247\n17 |  Romania |  8,771 |  5,992 |  2,779\n18 |  Turkey |  7,906 |  2,648 |  5,258\n19 |  Denmark |  7,615 |  4,706 |  2,909\n20 |  South Korea |  7,310 |  774 |  6,536\n\nPoland is less dependent on external trade than most other Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries, but its volume of trade with Europe is still substantial.\nIn 2011 the volume of trade (exports plus imports) with the Eurozone as share\nof GDP was 40%, a doubling from the mid 1990s. 30% of Poland's exports are to\nGermany and another 30% to the rest of Europe. There has been substantial\nincrease in Poland's exports to Russia. However, in August 2014, exports of\nfruits and vegetables to Russia fell dramatically following its politically\nmotivated ban by Moscow.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) was at 40% of GDP in 2010, a doubling over the\nlevel in 2000. Most FDI into Poland comes from France, Germany, and the\nNetherlands. Polish firms in turn have foreign investments primarily in Italy\nand Luxembourg. Most of the internal FDI is in manufacturing, which makes it\nsusceptible to economic fluctuations in the source countries.\n\nThe UAE is Poland's largest trading partner in the Arab world.\n\nThe government offers investors various forms of state aid, such as CIT tax at\nthe level of 19% and investment incentives in 14 Special Economic Zones (among\nothers: income tax exemption, real estate tax exemption, competitive land\nprices), several industrial and technology parks, the possibility to benefit\nfrom the EU structural funds, brownfield and greenfield locations. According\nto the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the level of FDI inflow into Poland in\n2006 amounted to €13.9 billion.\n\nAccording to an Ernst & Young report, Poland ranks 7th in the world in terms\nof investment attractiveness. However, Ernst & Young's 2010 European\nattractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job\ncreation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008. According to\nan OECD report, in 2004 Poland was one of the hardest-working nations in\nEurope.
