    "text": "Historical development of GDP per capita\n\nBefore the 1880s, Argentina was a relatively isolated backwater, dependent on\nthe salted meat, wool, leather, and hide industries for both the more\nsignificant part of its foreign exchange and the generation of domestic income\nand profits. The Argentine economy began to experience swift growth after 1880\nthrough the export of livestock and grain raw materials, and British and\nFrench investment, marking the beginning of a fifty-year era of significant\neconomic expansion and mass European immigration.[_citation needed_]\n\nFrom 1880 to 1905, this expansion resulted in a 7.5-fold growth in GDP during\nits most vigorous period, averaging about 8% annually.[_citation needed_] One\nimportant measure of development, GDP per capita, rose from 35% of the United\nStates average to about 80% during that period. Growth then slowed\nconsiderably, such that by 1941 Argentina's real per capita GDP was roughly\nhalf that of the U.S. Even so, from 1890 to 1950, the country's per capita\nincome was similar to that of Western Europe; although income in Argentina\nremained considerably less evenly distributed. According to a study by Baten\nand Pelger and Twrdek (2009), where the authors compare anthropometric values,\ni.e., height with real wages, Argentina's GDP increased for the decades after\n1870.[_citation needed_] Before 1910 however, the heights have been left\nunaffected. This, in turn, suggests that the increase in the population's\nwelfare did not occur during the income expansion of the given\nperiod.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Great Depression caused Argentine GDP to fall by a fourth between 1929 and\n1932. Having recovered its lost ground by the late 1930s partly through import\nsubstitution, the economy continued to grow modestly during World War II\n(contrary to the recession caused by the previous world war).[_citation\nneeded_] The war led to reduced availability of imports and higher prices for\nArgentine exports that combined to create a US$1.6 billion cumulative surplus,\na third of which was blocked as inconvertible deposits in the Bank of England\nby the Roca–Runciman Treaty. Benefiting from innovative self-financing and\ngovernment loans alike, value-added in manufacturing nevertheless surpassed\nthat of agriculture for the first time in 1943, employed over 1 million by\n1947, and allowed the need for imported consumer goods to decline from 40% of\nthe total to 10% by 1950.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe populist administration of Juan Perón nationalized the Central Bank,\nrailways, and other strategic industries and services from 1945 to 1955.\nInflation first became a chronic problem during this period, averaging 26%\nannually from 1944 to 1974. The GDP per capita increased until the early\n1950s, where commodity prices dropped and the effects of nationalization led\nto stagnation.\n\nThe economy continued to decline during the National Reorganization Process\nfrom 1976 to 1983 and for some time afterward. The dictatorship's chief\neconomist, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, advanced a controversial, neoliberal\npolicy of financial liberalization that increased the debt burden and failed\nto curb inflation, which reached 344% in 1983. While black markets and\nshortages disappeared as price and exchange controls were removed, the\ncurrency devalued tenfold and the economy failed to grow.\n\nRecord foreign debt interest payments, tax evasion, and capital flight\nresulted in a balance of payments crisis that plagued Argentina with severe\nstagflation from 1975 to 1990, including a bout of hyperinflation in 1989 and\n1990.[_citation needed_] Attempting to remedy this situation, economist\nDomingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar in 1991 and limited the\nmoney supply's growth. His team then embarked on a path of trade\nliberalization, deregulation, and privatization. Inflation dropped to single\ndigits, and GDP grew by one third in four years.[_citation needed_]\n\nExternal economic shocks and a dependency on volatile short-term capital and\ndebt to maintain the overvalued fixed exchange rate diluted benefits, causing\nerratic economic growth from 1995 and the eventual collapse in 2001. That year\nand the next, the economy suffered its sharpest decline since 1930; by 2002,\nArgentina had defaulted on its debt. Its GDP had declined by nearly 20% in\nfour years, unemployment reached 25%, and the peso had depreciated 70% after\nbeing devalued and floated.[_citation needed_]\n\nArgentina's socio-economic situation has since been steadily improving.\nExpansionary policies and raw materials exports triggered a rebound in GDP\nfrom 2003 onward. This trend has been primarily maintained, creating over five\nmillion jobs and encouraging domestic consumption and fixed investment. Social\nprograms were strengthened, and a number of important firms privatized during\nthe 1990s were renationalized beginning in 2003. These include the postal\nservice, ASA (the water utility serving Buenos Aires), Pension funds\n(transferred to ANSES), Aerolíneas Argentinas, the energy firm YPF, and the\nrailways.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe economy nearly doubled from 2002 to 2011, growing an average of 7.1%\nannually and around 9% for five consecutive years between 2003 and\n2007.[_citation needed_] Real wages rose by around 72% from their low point in\n2003 to 2013. The 2008 financial crisis did affect the economy, with growth\nslowing to nearly zero in 2009; but high economic growth then resumed, and GDP\nexpanded by around 9% in both 2010 and 2011. Foreign exchange controls,\nausterity measures, persistent inflation, and downturns in Brazil, Europe, and\nother important trade partners, contributed to slower growth beginning in\n2012, however. Growth averaged just 1.3% from 2012 to 2014, and rose to 2.4%\nin 2015.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Argentine government bond market is based on GDP-linked bonds, and\ninvestors, both foreign and domestic, netted record yields amid renewed\ngrowth. Argentine debt restructuring offers in 2005 and 2010 resumed payments\non the majority of its almost US$100 billion in defaulted bonds and other debt\nfrom 2001.[_citation needed_]\n\nHistorical growth of Argentina from 1961 to 2016\n\nHoldouts controlling 7% of the bonds, including some small investors, hedge\nfunds, and vulture funds led by Paul Singer's Cayman Islands-based NML Capital\nLimited, rejected the 2005 and 2010 offer to exchange their defaulted bonds.\nSinger, who demanded US$832 million for Argentine bonds purchased for US$49\nmillion in the secondary market in 2008, attempted to seize Argentine\ngovernment assets abroad and sued to stop payments from Argentina to the 93%\nwho had accepted the earlier swaps despite the steep discount. According to\nestimates by Morgan Stanley, bondholders who instead accepted the 2005 offer\nof 30 cents on the dollar had by 2012 received returns of about 90%. Argentina\nsettled with virtually all holdouts in February 2016 at the cost of US$9.3\nbillion; NML received US$2.4 billion, a 392% return on the original value of\nthe bonds.\n\nWhile the Argentine Government considers debt leftover from illegitimate\ngovernments unconstitutional odious debt, it has continued servicing this debt\ndespite the annual cost of around US$14 billion and despite being nearly\nlocked out of international credit markets with annual bond issues since 2002\naveraging less than US$2 billion (which precludes most debt\nrollover).[_citation needed_]\n\nNevertheless, Argentina has continued to hold successful bond issues, as the\ncountry's stock market, consumer confidence, and overall economy continue to\ngrow. The country's successful, US$16.5 billion bond sale in April 2016 was\nthe largest in emerging market history.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn May 2018, Argentina's government asked the International Monetary Fund for\nits intervention, with an emergency loan for a $30 billion bailout, as\nreported by Bloomberg.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn May 2018, the official estimated inflation had peaked up to 25 percent a\nyear, and on 4 May Argentina's central bank raised interest rates on pesos to\n40 percent from 27.25 percent, which is the highest in the world, since the\nnational currency had lost 18% of its value since the beginning of the\nyear.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 2019, the inflation was considered the highest in 28 years according to the\nindex, ascending to 53.8%.[_citation needed_]\n\nTo the cause of the quarantine in 2020, in April, 143,000 SMEs will not be\nable to pay salaries and fixed expenses for the month, even with government\nassistance, so they will have to borrow or increase their capital\ncontribution, and approximately 35,000 companies consider closing their\nbusiness. even so, the president remains firm in his decision to maintain the\nstate of total quarantine. Despite cuts in the payment chain, some project 180\ntotal days and calculate 5% of companies that fell in May.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn February 2023, the rate of inflation in Argentina surpassed 100% for the\nfirst time since the early 1990s.\n\nIn December 2023, Argentina was seeing a projected 200% annualized inflation\nrate of the Argentine Peso. With this inflation in mind, Javier Milei\n(Argentina's newly sworn in president as of 10 December 2023, with 55.69% of\nthe vote in the runoff election) weakened the Argentine Peso by 50% to 800 per\ndollar in order to bring the official exchange rate (which was only used in\ntheory) down to the market exchange range, along with cuts to energy\nsubsidies, cancellations of public works, and more in order to save nearly 20\nbillion dollars in expenses. These policies achieved a budget surplus for the\nfirst time since 2012. Although these were impactful policies, Argentinians\nknew Milei would enact sweeping economic reforms, as he openly supported\nextreme economic policies as a self-described anarcho-capitalist. As part of\nJavier Milei's plans the Government of Argentina announced in April 2024 a cut\nof 15,000 state jobs.\n\nArgentina's 2023 annual inflation was the highest in the world at 211.4%. In\nJanuary 2024, Argentina's poverty rate reached 57.4%, the highest poverty rate\nin the country since 2004. Because of Milei's policies, the monthly inflation\nrate dropped to 2.4% in December 2024, marking an end to Argentina's period of\nhyperinflation. The poverty rate has seen a significant decrease in the 3rd\nquarter of 2024, steadily falling to 38.9% (lower than 2022), projected to\ndecrease further as Milei's reforms take effect. This figure has been\ncalculated by the Argentine government agency, the National Institute of\nStatistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC). They have international oversight\nfrom the IMF, lending credibility towards the calculation. In a Gallup poll on\nthe 10th of December, 2024, the approval ratings for Milei still held at over\n50%, with trust in the government having doubled since 2023. The perception of\nimprovement in the standard of living has also seen a marked improvement, with\n53% of Argentinians believing that their standard of living is improving,\nreaching the same high as 2015. 41% believe the economy of their city is also\nimproving. However, challenges still remain, and 69% of Argentinians believe\nit is a bad time to look for a job in this economy, while 35% don't have\nenough money for food, although these figures are a modest decrease from their\n2 decade high in 2019. 59% of the richest 20%, but 39% of the poorest 20%\napprove of Milei's governance, though the ratings are still higher across the\nboard when compared to Milei's predecessor, Alberto Fernandez.\n\nIn the first and second quarter of 2024, Argentina's GDP contracted by 2.1%\nand 1.8%. However, in the last quarter, it expanded 3.9% despite the\nsignificant austerity implemented by the president. Conversely, agriculture\nrebounded dramatically from a severe drought, achieving an impressive growth\nrate of 80.2% as conditions improved. The economy of Argentina is projected to\ngrow by 5.5% in 2025 by the BBVA, and 3.5% by Goldman Sach's as inflation\nstabilizes and investment starts pouring in due to the Milei's liberalisation\nof the economy. The financial improvements seen in the 3rd quarter of 2024 are\ncomplemented by society's renewed confidence in the government, creating a\npositive outlook for 2025. Favourable results and normalization in Argentina's\neconomy are expected to continue in 2025. The annual inflation rate, which was\n211% in 2023, is expected to be below 30% in 2025. Economic activity has also\nbegun to recover after the severe recession at the beginning of 2024. The\neconomy is expected to expand by more than 4% in 2025.",

The country\nis the fifth largest producer in the world.\n\nArgentina is one of the world's major agricultural producers, ranking among\nthe top producers in most of the following, exporters of beef, citrus fruit,\ngrapes, honey, maize, sorghum, soybeans, squash, sunflower seeds, wheat, and\nyerba mate. Agriculture accounted for 9% of GDP in 2010, and around one fifth\nof all exports (not including processed food and feed, which are another\nthird). Commercial harvests reached 103 million tons in 2010, of which over 54\nmillion were oilseeds (mainly soy and sunflower), and over 46 million were\ncereals (mainly maize, wheat, and sorghum).\n\nArgentina is the largest producer in the world of yerba mate, one of the 5\nlargest producers in the world of soy, maize, sunflower seed, lemon and pear,\none of the 10 largest producers in the world of barley, grape, artichoke,\ntobacco and cotton, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of wheat,\nsugarcane, sorghum and grapefruit.\n\nIn 2018, Argentina was the 3rd largest producer of soy in the world, with 37.7\nmillion tons produced (behind only the US and Brazil); the 4th largest\nproducer of maize in the world, with 43.5 million tons produced (behind only\nthe US, China and Brazil); the 12th largest producer of wheat in the world,\nwith 18.5 million tons produced; the 11th largest producer in the world of\nsorghum, with 1.5 million tons produced; the 10th largest producer of grape in\nthe world, with 1.9 million tons produced, besides having produced 19 million\ntons of sugarcane, mainly in the province of Tucumán \\- Argentina produces\nnear 2 million tons of sugar with the produced cane. In the same year\nArgentina produced 4.1 million tons of barley, being one of the 20 largest\nproducers in the world of this cereal. The country is also one of the world's\nlargest producers of sunflower seed: in 2010, it was the 3rd largest producer\nin the world with 2.2 million tons. In 2018, Argentina also produced 2.3\nmillion tons of potato, almost 2 million tons of lemon, 1.3 million tons of\nrice, 1 million tons of orange, 921 thousand tons of peanut, 813 thousand tons\nof cotton, 707 thousand tons of onion, 656 thousand tons of tomato, 565\nthousand tons of pear, 510 thousand tons of apple, 491 thousand tons of oats,\n473 thousand tons of beans, 431 thousand tons of tangerine, 302 thousand tons\nof yerba mate, 283 thousand tons of carrot, 226 thousand tons of peach, 194\nthousand tons of cassava, 174 thousand tons of olives, 174 thousand tons of\nbanana, 148 thousand tons of garlic, 114 thousand tons of grapefruit, 110\nthousand tons of artichoke, in addition to smaller productions of other\nagricultural products.\n\nIn livestock, Argentina was, in 2019, the 4th world producer of beef, with a\nproduction of 3 million tons (only behind USA, Brazil and China), the 4th\nworld producer of honey, the 10th world producer of wool, the world's 13th\nlargest producer of chicken meat, the world's 23rd largest producer of pork,\nthe 18th largest producer of cow's milk and the world's 14th largest producer\nof chicken egg.\n\nSoy and its byproducts, mainly animal feed and vegetable oils, are major\nexport raw materials with one fourth of the total; cereals added another 10%.\nCattle-raising is also a major industry, though mostly for domestic\nconsumption; beef, leather and dairy were 5% of total exports. Sheep-raising\nand wool are important in Patagonia, though these activities have declined by\nhalf since 1990. Biodiesel, however, has become one of the fastest growing\nagro-industrial activities, with over US$2 billion in exports in 2011.\n\nFruits and vegetables made up 4% of exports: apples and pears in the Río Negro\nvalley; rice, oranges and other citrus in the northwest and Mesopotamia;\ngrapes and strawberries in Cuyo (the west), and berries in the far south.\nCotton and tobacco are major crops in the Gran Chaco, sugarcane and chile\npeppers in the northwest, and olives and garlic in the west. Yerba mate tea\n(Misiones), tomatoes (Salta) and peaches (Mendoza) are grown for domestic\nconsumption. Organic farming is growing in Argentina, and the nearly 3 million\nhectares (7.5 million acres) of organic cultivation is second only to\nAustralia. Argentina is the world's fifth-largest wine producer, and fine wine\nproduction has taken major leaps in quality. A growing export, total\nviticulture potential is far from having been met. Mendoza is the largest wine\nregion, followed by San Juan.\n\nGovernment policy towards the lucrative agrarian sector is a subject of, at\ntimes, contentious debate in Argentina. A grain embargo by farmers protesting\nan increase in export taxes for their products began in March 2008, and,\nfollowing a series of failed negotiations, strikes and lockouts largely\nsubsided only with the 16 July, defeat of the export tax-hike in the Senate.\n\nArgentine fisheries bring in about a million tons of catch annually, and are\ncentered on Argentine hake, which makes up 50% of the catch; pollock, squid,\nand centolla crab are also widely harvested. Forestry has long history in\nevery Argentine region, apart from the pampas, accounting for almost 14\nmillion m3 of roundwood harvests. Eucalyptus, pine, and elm (for cellulose)\nare also grown, mainly for domestic furniture, as well as paper products (1.5\nmillion tons). Fisheries and logging each account for 2% of exports.\n\nThe Vaca Muerta tight oil (shale oil) field holds 2.58×109 m3 (16.2×10~~^~~ 9\nbbl) of oil and 8.7×10~~^~~ 12 m3 (308×10~~^~~ 12 cu ft) of natural gas. It is\nestimated to be the third largest in the world.",

According to the 2019 list, Argentina has the 31st most\nvaluable industry in the world (57.7 billion dollars), behind Mexico, Brazil\nand Venezuela, but ahead of Colombia, Peru and Chile.\n\nIn 2019, Argentina was the 31st world producer of steel, the 28th producer of\nvehicles, the 22nd world producer of beer, the 4th world producer of soybean\noil and the 3rd world producer of sunflower oil, among other industrial\nproducts.\n\nManufacturing is the largest single sector in the nation's economy (15% of\nGDP), and is well-integrated into Argentine agriculture, with half the\nnation's industrial exports being agricultural in nature. Based on food\nprocessing and textiles during its early development in the first half of the\n20th century, industrial production has become highly diversified in\nArgentina. Leading sectors by production value are: food processing and\nbeverages; motor vehicles and auto parts; refinery products, and biodiesel;\nchemicals and pharmaceuticals; steel and aluminium; and industrial and farm\nmachinery; electronics and home appliances. These latter include over three\nmillion big ticket items,[_vague_] as well as an array of electronics, kitchen\nappliances and cellular phones, among others.\n\nArgentina's auto industry produced 791,000 motor vehicles in 2013, and\nexported 433,000 (mainly to Brazil, which in turn exported a somewhat larger\nnumber to Argentina); Argentina's domestic new auto market reached a record\n964,000 in 2013. This marked a peak in vehicle production, by 2021 production\nhad fallen to 434,753 vehicles. Vehicles remain Argentina's top export to\nBrazil, accounting for $3.1bil in exports in 2021.\n\nBeverages are another significant sector, and Argentina has long been among\nthe top five wine producing countries in the world; beer overtook wine\nproduction in 2000, and today leads by nearly two billion liters a year to\none. Other manufactured goods include: glass and cement; plastics and tires;\nlumber products; textiles; tobacco products; recording and print media;\nfurniture; apparel and leather.\n\nMost manufacturing is organized in the 314 industrial parks operating\nnationwide as of 2012, a fourfold increase over the past decade. Nearly half\nthe industries are based in the Greater Buenos Aires area, although Córdoba,\nRosario, and Ushuaia are also significant industrial centers; the latter city\nbecame the nation's leading center of electronics production during the 1980s.\nThe production of computers, laptops, and servers grew by 160% in 2011, to\nnearly 3.4 million units, and covered two-thirds of local demand. Argentina\nhas also become an important manufacturer of cell phones, providing about 80%\nof all devices sold in the country. Farm machinery, another important rubric\nhistorically dominated by imports, was similarly replaced by domestic\nproduction, which covered 60% of demand by 2013. Production of cell phones,\ncomputers, and similar products is actually an \"assembly\" industry, with the\nmajority of the higher technology components being imported, and the designs\nof products originating from foreign countries. High labour costs for\nArgentina assembly work tend to limit product sales penetration to Latin\nAmerica, where regional trade treaties exist.\n\nConstruction permits nationwide covered over 15 million m2 (160 million ft2)\nin 2013. The construction sector accounts for over 5% of GDP, and two-thirds\nof construction is for residential buildings.\n\nArgentine electric output totaled over 133 billion kWh in 2013. This was\ngenerated in large part through well developed natural gas and hydroelectric\nresources. Nuclear energy is also of high importance, and the country is one\nof the largest producers and exporters, alongside Canada and Russia of\ncobalt-60, a radioactive isotope widely used in cancer therapy."

The private sector banks account for most of the 80 active\ninstitutions (over 4,000 branches) and holds nearly 60% of deposits and loans,\nand as many foreign-owned banks as local ones operate in the country. The\nlargest bank in Argentina by far, however, has long been the public Banco de\nla Nación Argentina. Not to be confused with the Central Bank, this\ninstitution now accounts for 30% of total deposits and a fifth of its loan\nportfolio.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Argentina's financial system was consolidated and\nstrengthened. Deposits grew from less than US$15 billion in 1991 to over US$80\nbillion in 2000, while outstanding credit (70% of it to the private sector)\ntripled to nearly US$100 billion.\n\nThe banks largely lent US dollars and took deposits in Argentine pesos, and\nwhen the peso lost most of its value in early 2002, many borrowers again found\nthemselves hard pressed to keep up. Delinquencies tripled to about 37%. Over a\nfifth of deposits had been withdrawn by December 2001, when Economy Minister\nDomingo Cavallo imposed a near freeze on cash withdrawals. The lifting of the\nrestriction a year later was bittersweet, being greeted calmly, if with some\numbrage, at not having these funds freed at their full U.S. dollar value. Some\nfared worse, as owners of the now-defunct Velox Bank defrauded their clients\nof up to US$800 million.\n\nCredit in Argentina is still relatively tight. Lending has been increasing 40%\na year since 2004, and delinquencies are down to less than 2%. Still, credit\noutstanding to the private sector is, in real terms, slightly below its 1998\npeak, and as a percent of GDP (around 18%) quite low by international\nstandards. The prime rate, which had hovered around 10% in the 1990s, hit 67%\nin 2002. Although it returned to normal levels quickly, inflation, and more\nrecently, global instability, have been affecting it again. The prime rate was\nover 20% for much of 2009, and around 17% since the first half of 2010.\n\nPartly a function of this and past instability, Argentines have historically\nheld more deposits overseas than domestically. The estimated US$173 billion in\noverseas accounts and investment exceeded the domestic monetary base (M3) by\nnearly US$10 billion in 2012."

The\nelectricity sector in Argentina constitutes the third largest power market in\nLatin America. It mainly still relies on centralised generation by natural gas\npower generation (51%), hydroelectricity (28%), and oil-fired generation\n(12%). Resource estimates of unconventional shale gas and tight oil in the\nVaca Muerta oil field and elsewhere are estimated to be the world's third-\nlargest. In 2017, Argentina was the 18th largest producer in the world (and\nthe largest producer in Latin America) of natural gas. In 2020, the country\nwas the 28th largest producer of oil in the world, extracting 70,000 m3\n(440,300 bbl) per day.\n\nDespite the country's large untapped wind and solar potential new renewable\nenergy technologies and distributed energy generation are barely exploited.\nWind energy is the fastest growing among new renewable sources. Fifteen wind\nfarms have been developed since 1994 in Argentina, the only country in the\nregion to produce wind turbines. The 55 MW of installed capacity in these in\n2010 will increase by 895 MW upon the completion of new wind farms begun that\nyear. Solar power is being promoted with the goal of expanding installed solar\ncapacity from 6 MW to 300, and total renewable energy capacity from 625 MW to\n3,000 MW. At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in\nterms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the\nworld in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the\nworld in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW).\n\nArgentina is in the process of commissioning large centralised energy\ngeneration and transmission projects. An important number of these projects\nare being financed by the government through trust funds, while independent\nprivate initiative is limited as it has not fully recovered yet from the\neffects of the Argentine economic crisis.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe first of the three nuclear reactors was inaugurated in 1974, and in 2015\nnuclear power generated 5% of the country's energy output.\n\nThe electricity sector was unbundled in generation, transmission and\ndistribution by the reforms carried out in the early 1990s. Generation occurs\nin a competitive and mostly liberalized market, in which 75% of the generation\ncapacity is owned by private utilities. In contrast, the transmission and\ndistribution sectors are highly regulated and much less competitive than\ngeneration."

There are over 230,000 km (144,000\nmi) of roads (not including private rural roads) of which 72,000 km (45,000\nmi) are paved, and 2,800 kilometres (1,700 mi) are expressways, many of which\nare privatized tollways. Having tripled in length in the last decade,\nmultilane expressways now connect several major cities with more under\nconstruction. Expressways are, however, currently inadequate to deal with\nlocal traffic, as over 12 million motor vehicles were registered nationally as\nof 2012 (the highest, proportionately, in the region).\n\nThe railway network has a total length of 37,856 kilometres (23,523 mi),\nthough at the network's peak this figure was 47,000 km (29,204 mi). After\ndecades of declining service and inadequate maintenance, most intercity\npassenger services shut down in 1992 following the privatization of the\ncountry's railways and the breaking up of the state rail company, while\nthousands of kilometers fell into disuse. Outside Greater Buenos Aires most\nrail lines still in operation are freight related, carrying around 23 million\ntons a year. The metropolitan rail lines in and around Buenos Aires remained\nin great demand owing in part to their easy access to the Buenos Aires\nUnderground, and the commuter rail network with its 833 kilometres (518 mi)\nlength carries around 1.4 million passengers daily.\n\nIn April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law\nwhich re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos as Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos,\neffectively re-nationalising the country's railways. In the years leading up\nto this move, the country's railways had seen significant investment from the\nstate, purchasing new rolling stock, re-opening lines closed under\nprivatization and re-nationalising companies such as the Belgrano Cargas\nfreight operator. Some of these re-opened services include the General Roca\nRailway service to Mar del Plata, the Tren a las Nubes tourist train and the\nGeneral Mitre Railway service from Buenos Aires to Córdoba. while brand new\nservices include the Posadas-Encarnación International Train.\n\nInaugurated in 1913, the Buenos Aires Underground was the first underground\nrail system built in Latin America, the Spanish speaking world and the\nSouthern Hemisphere. No longer the most extensive in South America, its 60\nkilometres (37 mi) of track carry a million passengers daily.\n\nArgentina has around 11,000 km (6,835 mi) of navigable waterways, and these\ncarry more cargo than do the country's freight railways. This includes an\nextensive network of canals, though Argentina is blessed with ample natural\nwaterways as well, the most significant among these being the Río de la Plata,\nParaná, Uruguay, Río Negro, and Paraguay rivers. The Port of Buenos Aires,\ninaugurated in 1925, is the nation's largest; it handled 11 million tons of\nfreight and transported 1.8 million passengers in 2013.\n\nAerolíneas Argentinas is the country's main airline, providing both extensive\ndomestic and international service. LADE is a military-run commercial airline\nthat flies extensive domestic services. The nation's 33 airports handled air\ntravel totalling 25.8 million passengers in 2013, of which domestic flights\ncarried over 14.5 million; the nation's two busiest airports, Jorge Newbery\nand Ministro Pistarini International Airports, boarded around 9 million\nflights each."

However, although agricultural\nraw materials are over 20% of the total exports, agricultural goods still\naccount for over 50% of exports when processed foods are included. Soy\nproducts alone (soybeans, vegetable oil) account for almost one fourth of the\ntotal. Cereals, mostly maize and wheat, which were Argentina's leading export\nduring much of the twentieth century, make up less than one tenth now.\n\nIndustrial goods today account for over a third of Argentine exports. Motor\nvehicles and auto parts are the leading industrial export, and over 12% of the\ntotal merchandise exports. Chemicals, steel, aluminum, machinery, and plastics\naccount for most of the remaining industrial exports. Trade in manufactures\nhas historically been in deficit for Argentina, however, and despite the\nnation's overall trade surplus, its manufacturing trade deficit exceeded US$30\nbillion in 2011. Accordingly, the system of non-automatic import licensing was\nextended in 2011, and regulations were enacted for the auto sector\nestablishing a model by which a company's future imports would be determined\nby their exports (though not necessarily in the same rubric).\n\nA net energy importer until 1987, Argentina's fuel exports began increasing\nrapidly in the early 1990s and today account for about an eighth of the total;\nrefined fuels make up about half of that. Exports of crude petroleum and\nnatural gas have recently been around US$3 billion a year. Rapidly growing\ndomestic energy demand and a gradual decline in oil production, resulted in a\nUS$3 billion energy trade deficit in 2011 (the first in 17 years) and a US$6\nbillion energy deficit in 2013.\n\nArgentine imports have historically been dominated by the need for industrial\nand technological supplies, machinery, and parts, which have averaged US$50\nbillion since 2011 (two-thirds of total imports). Consumer goods including\nmotor vehicles make up most of the rest. Trade in services has historically in\ndeficit for Argentina, and in 2013 this deficit widened to over US$4 billion\nwith a record US$19 billion in service imports. The nation's chronic current\naccount deficit was reversed during the 2002 crisis, and an average current\naccount surplus of US$7 billion was logged between 2002 and 2009; this surplus\nlater narrowed considerably, and has been slightly negative since 2011."

The\nglobal crisis cut this figure to US$4 billion in 2009; but inflows recovered\nto US$6.2 billion in 2010. and US$8.7 billion in 2011, with FDI in the first\nhalf of 2012 up by a further 42%.\n\nFDI volume remained below the regional average as a percent of GDP even as it\nrecovered, however; Kirchner Administration policies and difficulty in\nenforcing contractual obligations had been blamed for this modest performance.\nThe nature of foreign investment in Argentina nevertheless shifted\nsignificantly after 2000, and whereas over half of FDI during the 1990s\nconsisted in privatizations and mergers and acquisitions, foreign investment\nin Argentina became the most technologically oriented in the region – with 51%\nof FDI in the form of medium and high-tech investment (compared to 36% in\nBrazil and 3% in Chile)."

A lobby representing\nUS creditors who refused to accept Argentina's debt-swap programmes has\ncampaigned to have the country expelled from the G20. These holdouts include\nnumerous vulture funds which had rejected the 2005 offer, and had instead\nresorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds.\nThese disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in\nNew York and, indirectly, to reduced Argentine access to international credit\nmarkets.\n\nThe government under President Mauricio Macri announced to be seeking a new\nloan from the International Monetary Fund in order to avoid another economic\ncrash similar to the one in 2001. The May 2018 announcement comes at a time of\nhigh inflation and falling interest rates. The loan would reportedly be worth\n$30 billion.\n\nFollowing 25 years of boom and bust stagnation, Argentina's economy doubled in\nsize from 2002 to 2013, and officially, income poverty declined from 54% in\n2002 to 5% by 2013; an alternative measurement conducted by CONICET found that\nincome poverty declined instead to 15.4%. Poverty measured by living\nconditions improved more slowly, however, decreasing from 17.7% in the 2001\nCensus to 12.5% in the 2010 Census. Argentina's unemployment rate similarly\ndeclined from 25% in 2002 to an average of around 7% since 2011 largely\nbecause of both growing global demand for Argentine raw materials and strong\ngrowth in domestic activity.\n\nGiven its ongoing dispute with holdout bondholders, the government has become\nwary of sending assets to foreign countries (such as the presidential plane,\nor artworks sent to foreign exhibitions) in case they might be impounded by\ncourts at the behest of holdouts.\n\nThe government has been accused of manipulating economic statistics."

    "text": "Official CPI inflation figures released monthly by INDEC have been a subject\nof political controversy since 2007 through 2015. Official inflation data are\ndisregarded by leading union leaders, even in the people sector, when\nnegotiating pay rises. Some private-sector estimates put inflation for 2010 at\naround 25%, much higher than the official 10.9% rate for 2010. Inflation\nestimates from Argentina's provinces are also higher than the government's\nfigures. The government backed up the validity of its data, but has called in\nthe International Monetary Fund to help it design a new nationwide index to\nreplace the current one.\n\nThe official government CPI is calculated based on 520 products, however the\ncontroversy arises from these products not being specified, and thus how many\nof those products are subject to price caps and subsidies. Economic analysts\nhave been prosecuted for publishing estimates that disagree with official\nstatistics. The government enforces a fine of up to 500,000 pesos for\nproviding what it calls \"fraudulent inflation figures\". Beginning in 2015, the\ngovernment again began to call for competitive bids from the private sector to\nprovide a weekly independent inflation index."

    "text": "Argentina money supply increases year over year. Daily data points.\n\nHigh inflation has been a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades.\nInflation has been unofficially estimated to be running at around 25% annually\nsince 2008, despite official statistics indicating less than half that figure;\nthese would be the highest levels since the 2002 devaluation. A committee was\nestablished in 2010 in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies by opposition\nDeputies Patricia Bullrich, Ricardo Gil Lavedra, and others to publish an\nalternative index based on private estimates. Food price increases,\nparticularly that of beef, began to outstrip wage increases in 2010, leading\nArgentines to decrease beef consumption per capita from 69 kg (152 lb) to 57\nkg (125 lb) annually and to increase consumption of other meats.\n\nConsumer inflation expectations of 28 to 30% led the national mint to buy\nbanknotes of its highest denomination (100 pesos) from Brazil at the end of\n2010 to keep up with demand. The central bank pumped at least 1 billion pesos\ninto the economy in this way during 2011.\n\nAs of June 2015[update], the government said that inflation was at 15.3%;\napproximately half that of some independent estimates. Inflation remained at\naround 18.6% in 2015 according to an International Monetary Fund estimate; but\nfollowing a sharp devaluation enacted by the Mauricio Macri administration on\n17 December, inflation reignited during the first half of 2016 – reaching 42%\naccording to the Finance Ministry.\n\nSupermarkets in Argentina have adopted electronic price tags, allowing prices\nto be updated more quickly.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2019, reports suggested that the economy of the\ncountry is sinking, inflation is rising and the currency is depreciating.\nDespite the country receiving one of the largest IMF financial support\nprogrammes ever given to any nation, Argentina's poverty rose to 32% from 26%\nthe previous year. In August 2019, as an attempt to stabilise the economy, the\ngovernment decided to impose restrictions on foreign currency purchases.\n\nThe inflation rate in Argentina rose to 52.3 percent in February 2022 from\n50.7 percent in the prior month, the steepest increase since September. In\nAugust the interest rate was hiked to 69.5% as inflation further deteriorated\nhitting a 20-year high at 70% driven by many factors among them the 2021–2022\ninflation surge and forecasted to top 90% by the end of the year. Inflation\nhit past 100% in February 2023 for the first time since 1991. On October 12,\n2023, Argentina's central bank again increased the benchmark interest rate\nfrom 118% to 133% since September's inflation report (12.7% monthly and 138%\nannually) was worse than forecasted.\n\nArgentine workers have protested the inflation holding funerals to mourn the\n\"death of (their) wages\". Photographer Irina Werning wrote the following\nsentence \"inflation destroys savings, impedes planning, and discourages\ninvestment.\" taking about the protest\n\nAfter Milei's landslide victory in the presidential elections held on October\n2023, large efforts were made to curb the inflation rate, with major\nsuccesses. in January of 2022, the monthly inflation rate kept increasing from\n2.4% to a peak of 25% just before Milei's inauguration. Soon after coming to\npower, he devalued the peso by 50% in order to cut the wide gap between the\nofficial exchange rate (which was the theoretical evaluation of the peso) and\nthe market exchange rate (the rate which is used in practice). In a year he\nbrought it back down to a monthly 2.4%. However, because there was still a\nsignificant gap between the official and market exchange rates, Milei had\nenacted a decision to have a 2% monthly devaluation of the peso. This is an\nactive and intentional contributant to the inflation rate, meaning that the\nreal, monetary inflation rate is only 0.4%.\n\nIn 2024, the Argentinian Peso appreciated by 44.2% against the dollar,\noutperforming all other currencies. In contrast, the second best performing\ncurrency against the dollar is the Lira, which gained 21.2%, less than half of\nthe Peso's increase. These actions aimed to stabilize an economy teetering on\nthe brink of hyperinflation. The peso's strengthening doubled average wages in\ndollar terms to $990."

    "text": "In relation to other Latin American countries, Argentina has a moderate to low\nlevel of income inequality. Its Gini coefficient is of about 0.407 (2022). The\nsocial gap is worst in the suburbs of the capital, where beneficiaries of the\neconomic rebound live in gated communities, and many of the poor live in slums\nknown as villas miserias.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the most affluent 10% of Argentina's population had an\nincome 12 times that of the poorest 10%. That figure had grown to 18 times by\nthe mid-1990s, and by 2002, the peak of the crisis, the income of the richest\nsegment of the population was 43 times that of the poorest. These heightened\nlevels of inequality had improved to 26 times by 2006, and to 16 times at the\nend of 2010. Economic recovery after 2002 was thus accompanied by significant\nimprovement in income distribution: in 2002, the richest 10% absorbed 40% of\nall income, compared to 1.1% for the poorest 10%; by 2010, the former received\n29% of income, and the latter, 1.8%.\n\nArgentina has an inequality-adjusted human development index of 0.729,\ncompared to 0.578 and 0.709 for neighboring Brazil and Chile, respectively.\nThe 2010 Census found that poverty by living conditions still affect 1 in 8\ninhabitants, however; and while the official, household survey income poverty\nrate (based on U$S 100 per person per month, net) was 4.7% in 2013, the\nNational Research Council estimated income poverty in 2010 at 22.6%, with\nprivate consulting firms estimating that in 2011 around 21% fell below the\nincome poverty line. The World Bank estimated that, in 2013, 3.6% subsisted on\nless than US$3.10 per person per day."
