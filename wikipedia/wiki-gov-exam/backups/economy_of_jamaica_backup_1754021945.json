    "text": "Before independence, Jamaica's economy was largely focused on agriculture with\nthe vast majority of the labour force engaged in the production of sugar,\nbananas, and tobacco. According to one study, 18th century Jamaica had the\nhighest wealth inequality in the world, as a very small, slave-owning elite\nwas extremely wealthy while the rest of the population lived on the edge of\nsubsistence.\n\nThese products were mainly exported to the United Kingdom, Canada, and to the\nUnited States of America. Jamaica's trade relationships expanded substantially\nfrom 1938 to 1946, with total imports almost doubling from £6,485,000 to\n£12,452,000. After 1962, the Jamaican government pushed for economic growth\nand all sectors excluding bauxite/alumina, energy, and tourism had shrunk\nbetween 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Jamaica experienced its first year of positive\ngrowth since 1995 due to continued tight macroeconomic policies.\n\nInflation fell from 25% in 1995 to single digits in 2000, reaching a\nmultidecade low of 4.3% in 2004. Through periodic intervention in the market,\nthe central bank also has prevented any abrupt drop in the exchange rate. The\nJamaican dollar has been slipping, despite intervention, resulting in an\naverage exchange rate of J$73.40 per US$1.00 and J136.2 per €1.00 (February\n2011). In addition, inflation has been trending upward since 2004 and is\nprojected to once again reach a double digit rate of 12–13% through the year\n2008 due to a combination of unfavorable weather damaging crops and increasing\nagricultural imports and high energy prices.\n\nOver the last 30 years, real per capita GDP increased at an average of just\none per cent per year, making Jamaica one of the slowest growing developing\ncountries in the world.\n\nTo reverse this trajectory, the Government of Jamaica embarked on a\ncomprehensive and ambitious program of reforms for which it has garnered\nnational and international support: a four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF)\nby the International Monetary Fund (IMF) providing a support package of US$932\nmillion; World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)\nprograms providing US$510 million each to facilitate the GoJ's economic reform\nagenda to stabilise the economy, reduce debt and create the conditions for\ngrowth and resilience.. In addition, the International Finance Corporation\n(IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will continue to\nsupport private sector development.\n\nThe reform program is beginning to bear fruit: Institutional reforms and\nmeasures to improve the environment for the private sector have started to\nrestore confidence in the Jamaican economy. Jamaica jumped 27 places to 58\namong 189 economies worldwide in the 2015 Doing Business ranking, the\ncountry's credit rating has improved and the Government has successfully\nraised more than US$2 billion in the international capital in the markets in\n2014 and 2015..\n\nDespite some revival, economic growth is still low: the Jamaican Government is\nforecasting real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.9 per cent for the\nfiscal year 2015/2016 and the country continues to be confronted by serious\nsocial issues that predominantly affect youth, such as high levels of crime\nand violence and high unemployment. Jamaica, which had seen its poverty rate\ndrop almost 20 per cent over two decades, saw it increase by eight per cent in\na few years.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Jamaica is approximately 6.0% (April 2022,\nStatistical Institute of Jamaica), with youth unemployment more than twice the\nnational rate, albeit trending downwards (15%). However, among Jamaica's\nassets are its skilled labour force and strong social and governance\nindicators."

    "section_name": "Agriculture",
    "text": "Agricultural production is an important contributor to Jamaica's economy.\nHowever, it is vulnerable to extreme weather, such as hurricanes and to\ncompetition from neighbouring countries such as the USA. Other difficulties\nfaced by farmers include thefts from the farm, known as praedial larceny.\nAgricultural production accounted for 7.4% of GDP in 1997, providing\nemployment for nearly a quarter of the country. Jamaica's agriculture,\ntogether with forestry and fishing, accounted for about 6.6% of GDP in 1999.\nSugar has been produced in Jamaica for centuries, it is the nation's dominant\nagricultural export. Sugar is produced in nearly every parish. The production\nof raw sugar in the year 2000 was estimated at 175,000 tons, a decrease from\n290,000 tons in 1978.\n\nJamaican agriculture has been less prominent in GDP in the 2000s than other\nindustries, hitting an all-time low between 2004 and 2008. This may have been\ndue to a reaction to increased competition as international trade policies\nwere enacted. For example, as NAFTA was enacted in 1993, a significant amount\nof Caribbean exports to the United States diminished, being out competed by\nLatin American exports. Another example is the Banana Import Regime's 3rd\nphase, in which EU nations had first given priority in banana imports to\npreviously colonised nations. Under pressure by the World Trade Organization,\nthe EU policy was altered to provide a non-discriminatory trade agreement.\nJamaica's banana industry was easily outpriced by American companies exporting\nLatin American goods. Jamaica's agriculture industry is now bouncing back,\ngrowing from being 6.6% of GDP to 7.2%.\n\nSugar formed 7.1% of the exports in 1999 and Jamaica made up about 4.8% of the\ntotal production of sugar in the Caribbean. Sugar is also used for the\nproduction of by-products such as molasses, rum and some wallboard is made\nfrom bagasse.\n\nBanana production in 1999 was 130,000 tons. Bananas formed 2.4% of the exports\nin 1999 and Jamaica formed around 7.5% of the total production of banana in\nthe Caribbean. Jamaica stopped exporting banana in 2008 after suffering from\nseveral years of hurricanes that devastated the plantations.\n\nCoffee is mainly grown around the Blue Mountains and in hilly areas. One type\nin particular, Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, is considered among the best in\nthe world because at those heights in the Blue Mountains, the cooler climate\ncauses the berries to take longer to ripen and the beans develop more of the\nsubstances which on roasting give coffee its flavor. Coffee formed 1.9% of\nexports in 1999. The picking season lasts from August to March. The coffee is\nexported from Kingston.\n\nCocoa is grown throughout Jamaica and local sales absorb about 1/3 of the\noutput to be made into instant drinks and confectionery. Citrus fruit is\nmainly grown in the central parts of Jamaica, particularly between the\nelevations of 1,000–2,500 feet. The picking season lasts from November to\nApril. Two factories in Bog Walk produce fruit juices, canned fruit, essential\noils and marmalade. Coconuts are grown on the northern and eastern coasts,\nwhich provide enough copra to supply factories to make butterine, margarine,\nlard, edible oil and laundry soap.\n\nVanilla is also grown.\n\nOther export crops are pimento, ginger, tobacco, sisal and other fruit are\nexported. Rice is grown around swampy areas around the Black River & around\nLong Bay in Hanover and Westmoreland parishes for local consumption.\n\nAs tastes have changed in Jamaica in favour of more meat and packaged food the\nnational food import bill has grown to the point that it threatens the health\nof the economy. The government has responded by encouraging gardening and\nfarming, a response which has had limited success. For example, the percentage\nof potatoes grown locally has increased, but imports of french fries have\ncontinued at a high level."

Livestock holdings include 400,000 head of\ncattle, 440,000 goats and 180,000 pigs. Dairying has increased since the\nerection of a condensed milk factory at Bog Walk in 1940. Even so, the supply\nof dairy products is not enough for local requirements and there are large\nimports of powdered milk, butter and cheese."

Several thousand fishermen make a living from fishing. The shallow\nwaters and cays off the south coast are richer than the northern waters. Other\nfishermen live on the Pedro Cays, 80 miles (130 km) to the south of Jamaica.\nJamaica supplies about half of its fish requirements; major imports of frozen\nand salted fish are imported from the United States and Canada.\n\nThe total catch in 2000 was 5,676 tons, a decrease from 11,458 tons in 1997;\nthe catch was mainly marine, with freshwater carp, barbel, etc., crustaceans &\nmolluscs."

Roundwood production\nwas 881,000 cu m (31.1 million cu ft) in 2000. About 68% of the timber cut in\n2000 was used as fuel wood while 32% was used for industrial use. The forests\nthat once covered Jamaica now exist only in mountainous areas. They only\nsupply 20% of the island timber requirements. The remaining forest is\nprotected from further exploitation. Other accessible mountain areas are being\nreforested, mainly with pines, mahoe and mahogany."

Bauxite and alumina formed 55.2% of exports in 1999 and are the second-\nleading money earner after tourism. Jamaica has reserves of over 2 billion\ntonnes, which are expected to last 100 years. Bauxite is found in the central\nparishes of St. Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, St. Catherine, St. Ann, and\nTrelawny. There are four alumina plants and six mines.\n\nJamaica has deposits of several million tons of gypsum on the southern slopes\nof the Blue Mountains. Jamaica produced 330,441 tons of gypsum in the year\n2000, some of which was used in the local cement industry and in the\nmanufacturing of building materials.\n\nOther minerals present in Jamaica include marble, limestone, and silica, as\nwell as ores of copper, lead, zinc, manganese and iron. Some of these are\nworked in small quantities. Petroleum has been sought, but so far none has\nbeen found."

Falls and\nAppleton Estate. Most of the tourist sites are landmarks as well as homes for\nmany Jamaicans. Many of the most frequented tourist sites are located mainly\nby water such as rivers and beaches where fishermen make a living from\nseafood. One of the most famous beach towns in Jamaica is Ocho Rios, a located\nin the parish of Saint Ann on the north coast of Jamaica. It was once a\nfishing village but now attracts millions of tourists yearly. The site is\npopular today because of the food and culture that can be found there.\n\nAnother famous location in Jamaica that attracts millions yearly is Dunn's\nRiver Falls, located in Ocho Rios; this waterfall is approximately 600 feet\nlong and runs off into the sea. Around the location many hotels and\nrestaurants are available and many street vendors sell food around the clock.\nAnother well-known beach town is Negril, the party capital of the country.\nThis beach town has many different factors to add to the night life."
