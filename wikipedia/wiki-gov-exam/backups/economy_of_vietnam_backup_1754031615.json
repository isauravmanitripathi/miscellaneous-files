It is the 33rd-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) and the 26th-largest economy in the world by purchasing power\nparity (PPP). It is a lower-middle income country with a low cost of living.\nVietnam is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations and the World Trade Organization.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, through the Đổi Mới reform period, Vietnam has made a\nshift from a highly centralized planned economy to a mixed economy. Before,\nSouth Vietnam was reliant on U.S. aid, while North Vietnam and reunified\nVietnam relied on communist aid until the Soviet Union's dissolution.\n\nThe economy uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year\nplans, with support from an open market-based economy. Over that period, the\neconomy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a\nperiod of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese\nenterprises are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Vietnam has become a\nleading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for\nforeign investment in Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to a forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers in February 2017,[_needs\nupdate_] Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world's economies, with a\npotential annual GDP growth rate of about 5.1 percent, which would make its\neconomy the 10th-largest in the world by 2050.[_needs update_] Vietnam has\nalso been named among the so-called Next Eleven and CIVETS countries.",

The feudal dynasties\nalways considered agriculture as the main economic base, and their economic\nthoughts have been predicated on physiocracy. Land ownership was regulated,\nand such large-scale works as dykes were constructed in the Red River Delta to\nfacilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to\ndo farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and\ncattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were\nvalued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the\nderogatory term _con buôn_. Thang Long (Hanoi) was the main handicraft\nmanufacturing center of the country. Chinese noted that the Vietnamese were\ndoing business just like the same with in the Chinese Song dynasty. From the\n9th to 13th century, the Vietnamese traded ceramics and silks with regional\npowers such as China, Champa, Western Xia, Java among others. Further\narcheological evidence suggests that Muslim traders had lived in Hanoi from\naround the 9th to 10th centuries, based on Muslim ceramics found in the Old\nQuarter of Hanoi.\n\nHowever, from the 16th century, Confucianism was losing its influence on\nVietnamese society and a monetary pre-capitalism economy began to develop.\nDuring the Lê–Mạc period, the state encouraged semi-industrial business and\nsea-traders, as the Vietnamese economy would mainly depended on them for the\nnext 250 years. Cities such as Dong Kinh, Hội An and others grew quickly under\nrapid urbanization. They were later constrained when foreign nations saw them\nas an economic threat.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Vietnam's economy had reached its peak as the country\nwas the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In the\nlate 18th century, the economy suffered depression because of a series of\ndiseases and disaster such as the Tay Son peasant rebellion which devastated\nthe country. In 1806, Emperor Gia Long of the new Nguyễn dynasty imposed the\n\"Sea Ban policy\", which banned all Vietnamese overseas business and stopped\nWestern merchants from entering Vietnam.[_dubious – discuss_] This policy led\nto stagnation of the Vietnamese economy in the early-19th century, and\ncontributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.[_failed verification_]",

    "text": "Until the French colonization in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had\nbeen mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French\ncolonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the\nFrench needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods,\ndesignating the South for agricultural production as it was better suited for\nagriculture, and the North for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in\nmineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the\ndevelopment of exports—coal from the North, rice from the South—and the\nimportation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing\nregional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the\nprincipal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with\nproducts such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also\ndeveloped some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and\nnonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi; railroads,\nroads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South,\nagricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally,\nrice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were\ncentered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly\nof food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.\n\nWhen the North and South were divided politically in 1954, they also adopted\ndifferent economic ideologies: socialism in the North and capitalism in the\nSouth. Destruction caused by the Second Indochina War from 1955 to 1975\nseriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's\n1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1\nmillion refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals,\ntechnicians and skilled workers out of the millions of war refugees.\n\nGDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956–1974 (in US$/year)  Year  | 1956  | 1958  | 1960  | 1962  | 1964  | 1966  | 1968  | 1970  | 1972  | 1974\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nRepublic of Vietnam | 62  | 88  | 105  | 100  | 118  | 100  | 85  | 81  | 90  | 65\nDemocratic Republic of Vietnam | 40  | 50  | 51  | 68  | 59  | 60  | 55  | 60  | 60  | 65",

The more modest[_clarification needed_] goals of the Third\nFive-Year Plan (1981–85) were a compromise between ideological and pragmatic\nfactions; they emphasized the development of agriculture and industry. Efforts\nwere also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of\ngovernment officials.\n\nAfter reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous\ndifficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in\ndistribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt\nproblems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience\na sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its\npeacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative\nto very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and\nindustrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was\nvalued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between\nUS$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance\nhave included[_according to whom?_] severe climatic conditions that afflicted\nagricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private\nownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military\noccupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed\ninternational aid for reconstruction).[_needs update_]\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the\nComecon, and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the Soviet Union\nand its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its\ntraditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue\nits exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic\ndevelopment. [_dead link_] Between 1975 and 1994, the United States imposed a\ntrade embargo on Vietnam, forbidding any trade during the 19-year period.\n\nIn 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (_Đổi\nMới_) that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized\neconomy to a \"socialist-oriented market economy\". _Đổi Mới_ combined\ngovernment planning with free-market incentives and encouraged the\nestablishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including foreign-\nowned enterprises. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity\nto lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the\npopulation by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per\nhousehold to two, called the two-child policy. By the late 1990s, the success\nof the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under _Đổi Mới_ was\nevident. More than 30,000 private businesses had been created, the economy was\ngrowing at an annual rate of more than 7%, and poverty was nearly halved.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Vietnam had structurally changed away from agriculture,\nbut without industrialisation (service-oriented globalisation).\n\nIn 1990, the state sector was the key hoped-for site of industrialisation. The\nstate sector transitioned away from the processes of bottom-up\ncommercialisation of the 1980s. This created a supply capacity. The supply\ncapacity allowed Vietnam to avoid negative shock as Soviet aid was removed,\nand the supply capacity allowed the economy of Vietnam to grow rapidly in the\n1990s.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, exports increased by as much as 20% to 30% in some\nyears. In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in\nthe midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia. Vietnam\nbecame a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007, which freed\nVietnam from textile quotas enacted worldwide as part of the Multi Fibre\nArrangement (MFA) in 1974. The MFA placed restrictions on the import by\nindustrialized countries of textiles from developing countries. For China and\nother WTO members, however, textile quotas under the MFA expired at the end of\n2004 as agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. A 2019\nstudy found that Vietnam's WTO entry led to substantial gains in productivity\nfor private firms, but had no impact on state-owned enterprises. In the\nabsence of state-owned enterprises, \"the overall productivity gains would have\nbeen about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy.\"",

    "text": "Vietnam's economic policy following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has been a\ncautious one, emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth. While\nthe country shifted toward a more market-oriented economy, the Vietnamese\ngovernment still continues to hold a tight rein over major state sectors, such\nas the banking system, state-owned enterprises and foreign trade. GDP growth\nfell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth\nof at least 5% since 2000.\n\nThe signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the United States\nand Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided\nfor \"normal trade relations\" status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It\nwas expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its\ntransformation into a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy.\nFurthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but\nalso from Europe, Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic\nplan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the\nprimacy of the state. Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even\nin the midst of the global recession, making it the world's second fastest-\ngrowing economy. At the same time, investment grew threefold and domestic\nsavings quintupled.\n\nIn 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all\nindustrial output. However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically\nin the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report rankings, largely\ndue to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions.\nOfficial corruption is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient\nregulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.\n\nVietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP\ngrowth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only China's.\nThe government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%. According to the\nMinister of Planning and Investment, the government targeted a GDP growth of\naround 8.5% in 2007.\n\nOn November 7, 2006, the General Council at the World Trade Organization (WTO)\napproved Vietnam's accession package. On January 11, 2007, Vietnam officially\nbecame the WTO's 149th member, after 11 years of preparation, including eight\nyears of negotiation. The country's access to the WTO was intended to provide\nan important boost to the economy, as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms\ncontinue and created options for trade expansion. However, the accession also\nbrought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing\nforeign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one\nof the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base,\nas it suffered the crippling effect of the Vietnam War from the 1950s to the\n1970s, the punitive embargoes of the United States and its allies, as well as\nthe austerity measures introduced in its aftermath. In 2012, the communist\nparty was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after a\nlarge number of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose. The main danger has\nbeen over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is\n5.2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis. The\ngovernment has launched schemes to reform the economy, such as lifting foreign\nownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing the country's state-owned\ncompanies that have been responsible for the recent economic downturn. By the\nend of 2013, the government is expected to privatize 25–50% of SOEs, only\nmaintaining control on public services and military. The recent reforms have\ncreated a major boom in the Vietnamese stock market as confidence in the\nVietnamese economy is returning.\n\nVietnam's current economic turmoil has given rise to questions of a possible\nnew period of changing political economy, however poverty remains to be the\nmain concern on the national performance index as of 2018. The Provincial\nGovernance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) found that 28%\nof survey respondents cited poverty as their main problem. Most respondents\nagreed with the statement that \"[P]overty reduction is imperative to ensuring\nthat Vietnam becomes an advanced, developed country. The percentage of the\npoorest Vietnamese respondents who believed that their economic situation\nwould worsen increased from 13% in 2016 to 26% in 2017.

Vietnam can overpower Singapore's economy\nby the next decade because of its strong foreign investment inflow and\nproductivity growth. However, Vietnam has surpassed Singapore just a year\nlater.\n\nIn the early 2020s, despite trade wars with Vietnam's major trade partners, a\npandemic and the increasing trend in deglobalisation, Vietnam has still\nmanaged to become Asia's top-performing economy. Since 2000, Vietnam has now\nmanaged to manufacture higher-value goods with better paying jobs due to its\nmore highly skilled workers. These workers now produce electronics which makes\nup 38% (in 2020) of Vietnam's exports (compared to 14% in 2010). The country\nhad achieved an average of 6.2% in economic growth (faster than any other\ncountry in Asia after China). Foreign investment on the luxury hotels sector\nand resorts will rise to support the tourist industry.",

      "• Following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Vietnam adopted a cautious economic policy prioritizing macroeconomic stability over rapid growth, maintaining strong government control over key sectors such as banking, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and foreign trade.",
      "• Vietnam’s GDP growth declined to 6% in 1998 and further to 5% in 1999, but from 2000 onwards, the country experienced continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% annually.",
      "• On July 13, 2000, Vietnam and the United States signed the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), granting Vietnamese goods \"normal trade relations\" status in the U.S. market, which was expected to accelerate Vietnam’s transition to a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy and attract foreign investment from the U.S., Europe, Asia, and other regions.",
      "• In 2001, the Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic plan that increased the role of the private sector while reaffirming state primacy; between 2000 and 2002, GDP growth rose to 6%-7% despite a global recession, making Vietnam the world’s second fastest-growing economy.",

      "• By 2003, the private sector contributed to more than 25% of all industrial output; however, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam’s ranking in the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness report declined sharply due to negative perceptions of government institutional effectiveness.",
      "• Endemic official corruption, weak property rights, inefficient market regulations, and slow reforms in labor and financial markets were identified as major challenges hindering Vietnam’s competitiveness.",

      "• WTO accession was expected to boost Vietnam’s economy by ensuring continued liberalizing reforms and expanding trade opportunities, but also posed challenges by exposing the economy to increased foreign competition.",
      "• Despite rapid growth exceeding 7% annually, Vietnam’s economy started from a very low base due to the long-term impacts of the Vietnam War (1950s-1970s), U.S. and allied embargoes, and post-war austerity measures.",

      "• The government initiated economic reforms including raising the foreign ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing SOEs, aiming to address economic downturns; by the end of 2013, plans were to privatize 25%-50% of SOEs, retaining state control only over public services and the military.",
      "• These reforms stimulated a significant boom in the Vietnamese stock market, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the economy.",
      "• Vietnam’s economic difficulties sparked debates about a potential new phase in its political economy, but poverty remained a primary concern as of 2018; the Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) reported that 28% of respondents identified poverty as their main problem.",

    "text": "Dau Tieng Solar Power Complex is the largest solar farm in Southeast Asia.\n\nPetroleum is the main source of energy, followed by coal, which contributes\nabout 25% of the country's energy (excluding biomass). Vietnam's oil reserves\nare in the range of 270–500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to\n403,300 barrels per day (64,120 m3/d) in 2004, but output is believed to have\npeaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector\nemployed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral\nexports. Also mined are antimony, bauxite, chromium, gold, iron, natural\nphosphates, tin, and zinc.\n\nIn 2019, Vietnam was the 9th largest world producer of antimony; 10th largest\nproducer of tin; 11th largest producer of bauxite; 12th largest world producer\nof titanium; 13th largest world producer of manganese and 9th largest producer\nof phosphate in the world. The country is also one of the world's largest\nproducers of ruby, sapphire, topaz and spinel.\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech\nelectrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014,\ncrude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all\nexports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004,\nwhen crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings. Petroleum exports are\nin the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining\ncapacity. Vietnam's only operational refinery, a facility at Cat Hai near Ho\nChi Minh City, has a capacity of only 800 barrels per day (130 m3/d). Refined\npetroleum accounted for 10.2% of total imports in 2002. As of 2012, Vietnam\nhad only one refinery, the Dung Quat refinery, but a second one, the Nghi Son\nRefinery was planned and was scheduled for construction in May 2013.\n\nVietnam's anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3.7 billion tons. Coal\nproduction was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons\nin 1999. Vietnam's potential natural gas reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic\nmeters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural\ngas. Hydroelectric power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam\nconfirmed plans to build a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance, and a\nsecond by a Japanese group.\n\nFrom 2019 onwards, renewable energy deployment in Vietnam accelerated, by far\nsurpassing the other Southeast Asian countries. Most of the newly deployed\nrenewable energy was in the form of solar and wind power plants. By 2023,\nhowever, this development had slowed down, mainly due to limited electrical\ngrid capacity and reduced government support.\n\nTotal energy consumption in Terrawatt-hours (TWh)  1970  | 1980  | 1990  | 2000  | 2010  | 2020  | 2023\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n91  | 54  | 77  | 214  | 540  | 1,204  | 1,359\n| Per capita consumption in Kilowatt-hours (KWh)\n2,162  | 1,022  | 1,153  | 2,711  | 6,180  | 12,462  | 13,744"

Following the resolution of most territorial\ndisputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported\nmore products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member,\nand China announced plans to establish the world's largest free-trade area by\n2010.\n\nVietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 11,\n2007.\n\nIn December 2015, Vietnam joined the ASEAN Economic Community along with the 9\nother ASEAN members. The community's goal is to integrate the 10 members of\nASEAN and bring a freer flow of labor, investment and trade to the region.\n\nCurrently, Vietnam is being tugged in multiple directions from multiple\npowers, namely, Russia, China and the U.S. in its attempts to achieve economic\nmultilateralization. Alternatively in the region, it is also pulled by either\nChina, South Korea, Japan or ASEAN countries, as well as other constituents\nsuch as Taiwan & Hong Kong as well as Australia/New Zealand and India in the\nregion (ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6)."

More recently, alarms on trade account\ndeficits have been raised domestically, especially after joining the WTO in\n2007. Throughout the next five years after 2007, Vietnam ran a trade deficit\nwith the rest of the world in the tens of billions of dollars, with the record\ntrade deficit in 2008 of US$18 billion.\n\nThe account deficit has since decreased. In 2012, Vietnam recorded a trade\nsurplus of US$780 million, the first trade surplus since 1993. Total trade\nreached US$228.13 billion, an increase of 12.1% from 2011. In 2013, Vietnam\nrecorded the second year of trade surplus of US$863 million. In 2014, Vietnam\nrecorded the third year of trade surplus of US$2.14 billion, the largest trade\nsurplus ever in history.

    "text": "In 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.\n\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI)\ncommitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been\ndispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and\nenvirons) of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. In 2003, new foreign direct\ninvestment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for\nlicensed FDI is industry and construction. Other sectors attracting FDI are\noil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation\nand communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped\nto receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of\n7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a\nrisky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the Japan External Trade\nOrganization of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the\nrespondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and\nskilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and\nthe failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment,\naccording to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for\nthe 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index\nin 2004. A study was conducted to examine the effect foreign investment had on\ncorruption in Vietnam. The study concluded that the propensity of foreign\nfirms to bribe at entry is higher in restricted sectors. Also, the removal of\ninvestment restrictions leads to reductions in bribery as a result of more\nForeign Investment Enterprises, and consequently more competition entering\nthat sector.\n\nThe World Bank's assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to\nsupport Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and\nsustainable development and to promote good governance. From 1993 through\n2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of official development\nassistance (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In\n2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65\nbillion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of\ndisbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of\nODA.\n\nPledged foreign direct investment was US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record\nUS$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008. Mergers and acquisitions have\ngradually become an important channel of investments in the economy,\nespecially after 2005.\n\nIn 2023, Vietnam realised foreign direct investment in the amount of US$23.2\nbillion and recorded a further US$36.6 billion in registered FDI commitments."

In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it\nsigned a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by\nadmission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has\nfurther integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements\nwith other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few.\nVietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-\nPacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US,\nin order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote\neconomic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP\nTPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to\nproductivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs\non both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade\nbalance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018\n(Vietnam Custom Department). Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed\nthe Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after\n10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which\nmanaged to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South\nKorea, and Singapore)"

In 1986 the government passed its first Law\non Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam.\nBetween 1981 and 2005, Vietnam created a new intellectual property law that\ngradually moved away from the Soviet-style concept of collective ownership. A\nmilestone in this evolution was the _Copyright Agreement_ that Vietnam\nconcluded with the US in 1997, serving primarily the US interest of preventing\nVietnam from becoming an international center for illegal copying. The\nconstitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly\nto cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to\nreduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global\nCompetitiveness Report by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017,\nrising from 77th place in 2006. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business\nrankings, Vietnam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017.\nThe Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing\naccess to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors."

With a growing\npopulation – 100 million as of 2024, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than\nhalf are under the age of 35– Vietnam made large public investments in\neducation, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This\nwas necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy\nfor the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing\nsector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure,\nensuring cheap mass access to necessities like electricity, water, and\nespecially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a\nhub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and\nKorean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built\nfactories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile\noperations in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010,\nsignalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of\nthe international business community."
