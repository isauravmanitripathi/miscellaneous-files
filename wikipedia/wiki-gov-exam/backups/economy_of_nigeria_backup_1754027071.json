Figures are inflation-adjusted\nto 2011 International Geary-Khamis dollars.\n\nThe **economy of Nigeria** is a middle-income, mixed economy and emerging\nmarket with expanding manufacturing, financial, service, communications,\ntechnology, and entertainment sectors. It is ranked as the 53rd-largest\neconomy in the world in terms of nominal GDP, the second largest in Africa in\nterms of purchasing power parity, and the 27th-largest in terms of purchasing\npower parity.\n\nThe country's re-emergent manufacturing sector became the largest on the\ncontinent in 2013, and it produces a large proportion of goods and services\nfor the region of West Africa. Nigeria's debt-to-GDP ratio was 36.63% in 2021\naccording to the IMF.\n\nAlthough oil revenues contributed 2/3 of state revenues, oil only contributes\nabout 9% to the GDP. Nigeria produces about 2.7% of the world's oil supply.\nAlthough the petroleum sector is important, as Nigeria's government revenues\nstill heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's\noverall economy. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up\nwith the country's rapid population growth. Nigeria was once a large net\nexporter of food, but currently imports some of its food products.\nMechanization has led to a resurgence in the manufacturing and exporting of\nfood products, and there was consequently a move towards food sufficiency. In\n2006, Nigeria came to an agreement with the Paris Club to buy back the bulk of\nits owed debts from them, in exchange for a cash payment of roughly US$12\nbillion.\n\nAccording to a report by Citigroup, published in February 2011, Nigeria had\nthe highest average GDP growth in the world between 2010 and 2050. Nigeria is\none of two countries from Africa among the 11 Global Growth Generators\ncountries.",

This rate ranged from a high of\n520 in March 2017 to a low of 350 in August 2017, due to a scarcity of forex\n(oil earnings had dropped by half), and speculative activity as alleged by the\nCentral Bank. All the while the official rate was pegged at 360.\n\nPer capita income (as % of USA) is calculated using data from estimates in the\nPPP link above, and census estimates, based on growth rates between census\nperiods. For instance, 2017 GDPs were 1,125 billion (Nigeria) vs. 19,417\nbillion (USA) and populations were estimated at 320 million vs 190 million.\nThe ratio is, therefore (1125/19417) / (190/320), which roughly comes to\n0.0975. These are estimates and are intended to get a feel for the relative\nwealth and standard of living, as well as the market potential of its middle\nclass.\n\nThis is a chart of trends of the global ranking of the Nigerian economy, in\ncomparison with other countries of the world, derived from the historical List\nof countries by GDP (PPP).\n\nYear | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 (est.)\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nRanking | 52 | 47 | 38 | 37 | 34 | 31 | 31 | 30 | 23 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23\n\nThis chart shows the variance in the parallel exchange rate at which the\nDollar can be obtained with Naira in Lagos, with \"Best\" being cheaper for a\nNigerian (i.e. stronger Naira).\n\nYear | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019\n---|---|---|---|---|---\nBest | 195 | 345 | 350 | 370 | 380\nWorst | 237 | 490 | 520 | 430 | 490\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at US$1 to\n314.27 Nigerian naira (as of 2017).\n\nThe current GDP per capita of Nigeria expanded 132% in the sixties reaching a\npeak growth of 283% in the seventies. But this proved unsustainable, and it\nconsequently shrank by 66% in the 1980s. In the 1990s, diversification\ninitiatives finally took effect and decadal growth was restored to 10%.\nAlthough GDP on a PPP basis did not increase until the 2000s.\n\nIn 2012, the GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture: 40%;\nservices: 30%; manufacturing: 15%; oil: 14%. By 2015, the GDP was composed of\nthe following sectors: agriculture: 18%; services: 55%; manufacturing: 16%;\noil: 8%\n\nIn 2005 Nigeria's inflation rate was an estimated 15.6%. Nigeria's goal under\nthe National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to\nreduce inflation to the single digits. By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at\n9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but\nrevenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%. By\n2012, expenditures stood at $31.61 billion, while revenues were $54.48\nbillion. In 2024, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) raised the Monetary Policy\nRate (MPR) again, this time to 18.5%, the 6th consecutive increase since\nSeptember 2022.",
