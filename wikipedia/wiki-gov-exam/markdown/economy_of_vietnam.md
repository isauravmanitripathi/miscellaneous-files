GDP per capita development in Vietnam

The **economy of Vietnam** is a developing mixed socialist-oriented market
economy. It is the 33rd-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic
product (GDP) and the 26th-largest economy in the world by purchasing power
parity (PPP). It is a lower-middle income country with a low cost of living.
Vietnam is a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations and the World Trade Organization.

Since the mid-1980s, through the Đổi Mới reform period, Vietnam has made a
shift from a highly centralized planned economy to a mixed economy. Before,
South Vietnam was reliant on U.S. aid, while North Vietnam and reunified
Vietnam relied on communist aid until the Soviet Union's dissolution.

The economy uses both directive and indicative planning through five-year
plans, with support from an open market-based economy. Over that period, the
economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a
period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese
enterprises are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Vietnam has become a
leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for
foreign investment in Southeast Asia.

According to a forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers in February 2017,[_needs
update_] Vietnam may be the fastest-growing of the world's economies, with a
potential annual GDP growth rate of about 5.1 percent, which would make its
economy the 10th-largest in the world by 2050.[_needs update_] Vietnam has
also been named among the so-called Next Eleven and CIVETS countries.

## History

### Before 1858

Civilization in Vietnam had been built on agriculture. The feudal dynasties
always considered agriculture as the main economic base, and their economic
thoughts have been predicated on physiocracy. Land ownership was regulated,
and such large-scale works as dykes were constructed in the Red River Delta to
facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to
do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and
cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were
valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the
derogatory term _con buôn_. Thang Long (Hanoi) was the main handicraft
manufacturing center of the country. Chinese noted that the Vietnamese were
doing business just like the same with in the Chinese Song dynasty. From the
9th to 13th century, the Vietnamese traded ceramics and silks with regional
powers such as China, Champa, Western Xia, Java among others. Further
archeological evidence suggests that Muslim traders had lived in Hanoi from
around the 9th to 10th centuries, based on Muslim ceramics found in the Old
Quarter of Hanoi.

However, from the 16th century, Confucianism was losing its influence on
Vietnamese society and a monetary pre-capitalism economy began to develop.
During the Lê–Mạc period, the state encouraged semi-industrial business and
sea-traders, as the Vietnamese economy would mainly depended on them for the
next 250 years. Cities such as Dong Kinh, Hội An and others grew quickly under
rapid urbanization. They were later constrained when foreign nations saw them
as an economic threat.

During the 17th century, Vietnam's economy had reached its peak as the country
was the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In the
late 18th century, the economy suffered depression because of a series of
diseases and disaster such as the Tay Son peasant rebellion which devastated
the country. In 1806, Emperor Gia Long of the new Nguyễn dynasty imposed the
"Sea Ban policy", which banned all Vietnamese overseas business and stopped
Western merchants from entering Vietnam.[_dubious – discuss_] This policy led
to stagnation of the Vietnamese economy in the early-19th century, and
contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.[_failed verification_]

### 1858–1975

Until the French colonization in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had
been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French
colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the
French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods,
designating the South for agricultural production as it was better suited for
agriculture, and the North for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in
mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the
development of exports—coal from the North, rice from the South—and the
importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.

The separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing
regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the
principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with
products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also
developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and
nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi; railroads,
roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South,
agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally,
rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were
centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly
of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.

When the North and South were divided politically in 1954, they also adopted
different economic ideologies: socialism in the North and capitalism in the
South. Destruction caused by the Second Indochina War from 1955 to 1975
seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's
1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1
million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals,
technicians and skilled workers out of the millions of war refugees.

The government's Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) aimed for solid high annual
growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and
sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.
The economy remained dominated by small-scale production, low labor
productivity, material and technological shortfalls, and insufficient food and
consumer goods. The more modest[_clarification needed_] goals of the Third
Five-Year Plan (1981–85) were a compromise between ideological and pragmatic
factions; they emphasized the development of agriculture and industry. Efforts
were also made to decentralize planning and improve the managerial skills of
government officials.

After reunification in 1975, the economy of Vietnam was plagued by enormous
difficulties in production, imbalances in supply and demand, inefficiencies in
distribution and circulation, soaring inflation rates, and rising debt
problems. Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience
a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its
peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative
to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and
industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was
valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between
US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance
have included[_according to whom?_] severe climatic conditions that afflicted
agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private
ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military
occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed
international aid for reconstruction).[_needs update_]

From the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the
Comecon, and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the Soviet Union
and its allies. Following the dissolution of the Comecon and the loss of its
traditional trading partners, Vietnam was forced to liberalize trade, devalue
its exchange rate to increase exports, and embark on a policy of economic
development. [_dead link_] Between 1975 and 1994, the United States imposed a
trade embargo on Vietnam, forbidding any trade during the 19-year period.

In 1986, Vietnam launched a political and economic renewal campaign (_Đổi
Mới_) that introduced reforms to facilitate the transition from a centralized
economy to a "socialist-oriented market economy". _Đổi Mới_ combined
government planning with free-market incentives and encouraged the
establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including foreign-
owned enterprises. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity
to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the
population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per
household to two, called the two-child policy. By the late 1990s, the success
of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under _Đổi Mới_ was
evident. More than 30,000 private businesses had been created, the economy was
growing at an annual rate of more than 7%, and poverty was nearly halved.

Since the early 1990s, Vietnam had structurally changed away from agriculture,
but without industrialisation (service-oriented globalisation).

In 1990, the state sector was the key hoped-for site of industrialisation. The
state sector transitioned away from the processes of bottom-up
commercialisation of the 1980s. This created a supply capacity. The supply
capacity allowed Vietnam to avoid negative shock as Soviet aid was removed,
and the supply capacity allowed the economy of Vietnam to grow rapidly in the
1990s.

Throughout the 1990s, exports increased by as much as 20% to 30% in some
years. In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in
the midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia. Vietnam
became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007, which freed
Vietnam from textile quotas enacted worldwide as part of the Multi Fibre
Arrangement (MFA) in 1974. The MFA placed restrictions on the import by
industrialized countries of textiles from developing countries. For China and
other WTO members, however, textile quotas under the MFA expired at the end of
2004 as agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. A 2019
study found that Vietnam's WTO entry led to substantial gains in productivity
for private firms, but had no impact on state-owned enterprises. In the
absence of state-owned enterprises, "the overall productivity gains would have
been about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy."

### Development since 1997

Vietnam's economic policy following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis has been a
cautious one, emphasizing macroeconomic stability rather than growth. While
the country shifted toward a more market-oriented economy, the Vietnamese
government still continues to hold a tight rein over major state sectors, such
as the banking system, state-owned enterprises and foreign trade. GDP growth
fell to 6% in 1998 and 5% in 1999. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth
of at least 5% since 2000.

The signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) between the United States
and Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided
for "normal trade relations" status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It
was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its
transformation into a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy.
Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but
also from Europe, Asia and other regions.

In 2001, the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic
plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the
primacy of the state. Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even
in the midst of the global recession, making it the world's second fastest-
growing economy. At the same time, investment grew threefold and domestic
savings quintupled.

In 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all
industrial output. However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically
in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report rankings, largely
due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions.
Official corruption is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient
regulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.

Vietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP
growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only China's.
The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%. According to the
Minister of Planning and Investment, the government targeted a GDP growth of
around 8.5% in 2007.

On November 7, 2006, the General Council at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
approved Vietnam's accession package. On January 11, 2007, Vietnam officially
became the WTO's 149th member, after 11 years of preparation, including eight
years of negotiation. The country's access to the WTO was intended to provide
an important boost to the economy, as it ensured that the liberalizing reforms
continue and created options for trade expansion. However, the accession also
brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing
foreign competition.

Vietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one
of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base,
as it suffered the crippling effect of the Vietnam War from the 1950s to the
1970s, the punitive embargoes of the United States and its allies, as well as
the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath. In 2012, the communist
party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after a
large number of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose. The main danger has
been over the bad debt in the banks totalling to 15% and forecast growth is
5.2% for 2012 but this is also due to the global economic crisis. The
government has launched schemes to reform the economy, such as lifting foreign
ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing the country's state-owned
companies that have been responsible for the recent economic downturn. By the
end of 2013, the government is expected to privatize 25–50% of SOEs, only
maintaining control on public services and military. The recent reforms have
created a major boom in the Vietnamese stock market as confidence in the
Vietnamese economy is returning.

Vietnam's current economic turmoil has given rise to questions of a possible
new period of changing political economy, however poverty remains to be the
main concern on the national performance index as of 2018. The Provincial
Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) found that 28%
of survey respondents cited poverty as their main problem. Most respondents
agreed with the statement that "[P]overty reduction is imperative to ensuring
that Vietnam becomes an advanced, developed country. The percentage of the
poorest Vietnamese respondents who believed that their economic situation
would worsen increased from 13% in 2016 to 26% in 2017. The percentage of
respondents with health insurance increased from 74% in 2016 to 81% in 2017,
with strongest gains in the rural population groups.

In 2017, Transparency International, a non-profit that tracks graft ranked
Vietnam as 113th worst out of 176 countries and regions for perceptions of
corruption.[_failed verification_] Several graft cases found in 2016 and 2017
led to the corruption crackdown which prosecuted many bankers, businesspeople,
and government officials under charges of corruption. PAPI found that bribery
at public district hospital services decreased from 17% in 2016 to 9% in 2017.
Reports of land seizures went down from an average of about 9% before 2013, to
less than 7% in 2017. The number of respondents who believed that their land
was sold at a fair market value decreased from 26% in 2014 to 21% in 2017.
Land-use graft and petty graft, such as police officers accepting bribes, are
common. According to Ralph Jennings, Vietnam has been privatizing many of its
state-owned operations to reduce corruption and increase efficiency.[_undue
weight? – discuss_]

As of March 2018, Vietnam's economy continued to grow, achieving the best
annual growth rate in over a decade; which has led media outlets to speculate
if in the near future it could be one of the Asian tigers.

According to DBS Bank in 2019, Vietnam's economy has the potential to grow at
a pace of about 6.0%–6.5% by 2029. Vietnam can overpower Singapore's economy
by the next decade because of its strong foreign investment inflow and
productivity growth. However, Vietnam has surpassed Singapore just a year
later.

In the early 2020s, despite trade wars with Vietnam's major trade partners, a
pandemic and the increasing trend in deglobalisation, Vietnam has still
managed to become Asia's top-performing economy. Since 2000, Vietnam has now
managed to manufacture higher-value goods with better paying jobs due to its
more highly skilled workers. These workers now produce electronics which makes
up 38% (in 2020) of Vietnam's exports (compared to 14% in 2010). The country
had achieved an average of 6.2% in economic growth (faster than any other
country in Asia after China). Foreign investment on the luxury hotels sector
and resorts will rise to support the tourist industry.

## Economic sectors

### Agriculture, fishery and forestry

Rice terraces in Sa Pa. Vietnam is the world's third-largest rice exporter.
Vietnam is the world's second-largest coffee producer and exporter. Vietnam is
the world's largest cashew exporter.

In 2003, Vietnam produced an estimated 30.7 million cubic meters of wood.
Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in
response to dwindling forests, Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and
raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden
artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a
tree-planting program.

Vietnam's fishing industry, which has abundant resources given the country's
long coastline and extensive network of rivers and lakes, has generally
experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million
tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to
more than US$2 billion, driven in part by shrimp farms in the South and
"catfish", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but
are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast
quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered antidumping
complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was
considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to
focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.

Vietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the
limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to
suffer. Vietnam is also the world's second-largest exporter of coffee,
trailing behind Brazil.

Vietnam produced in 2018:[_needs update_]

  * 44.0 million tons of rice (5th largest producer in the world, behind China, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh);
  * 17.9 million tons of sugarcane (16th largest producer in the world);
  * 14.8 million tons of vegetable;
  * 9.8 million tons of cassava (7th largest producer in the world);
  * 4.8 million tonnes of maize;
  * 2.6 million tonnes of cashew nut (largest producer in the world);
  * 2.0 million tons of banana (20th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.6 million tons of coffee (2nd largest producer in the world, only behind Brazil);
  * 1.5 million tons of coconut (6th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.3 million tons of sweet potato (9th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.2 million tons of watermelon;
  * 1.1 million tons of natural rubber (3rd largest producer in the world, behind Thailand and Indonesia);
  * 852 thousand tons of orange (18th largest producer in the world);
  * 779 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
  * 654 thousand tons of pineapple (12th largest producer in the world);
  * 270 thousand tons of tea (6th largest producer in the world);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

In 2018, Vietnam was the world's 5th largest producer of pork (3.8 million
tonnes). This year the country also produced 839 thousand tons of chicken
meat, 334 thousand tons of beef, 936 million liters of cow's milk, 20 thousand
tons of honey, among others.

### Energy, mining and minerals

Dau Tieng Solar Power Complex is the largest solar farm in Southeast Asia.

Petroleum is the main source of energy, followed by coal, which contributes
about 25% of the country's energy (excluding biomass). Vietnam's oil reserves
are in the range of 270–500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to
403,300 barrels per day (64,120 m3/d) in 2004, but output is believed to have
peaked and is expected to decline gradually.

In 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector
employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral
exports. Also mined are antimony, bauxite, chromium, gold, iron, natural
phosphates, tin, and zinc.

In 2019, Vietnam was the 9th largest world producer of antimony; 10th largest
producer of tin; 11th largest producer of bauxite; 12th largest world producer
of titanium; 13th largest world producer of manganese and 9th largest producer
of phosphate in the world. The country is also one of the world's largest
producers of ruby, sapphire, topaz and spinel.

Crude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech
electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014,
crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all
exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004,
when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings. Petroleum exports are
in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining
capacity. Vietnam's only operational refinery, a facility at Cat Hai near Ho
Chi Minh City, has a capacity of only 800 barrels per day (130 m3/d). Refined
petroleum accounted for 10.2% of total imports in 2002. As of 2012, Vietnam
had only one refinery, the Dung Quat refinery, but a second one, the Nghi Son
Refinery was planned and was scheduled for construction in May 2013.

Vietnam's anthracite coal reserves are estimated at 3.7 billion tons. Coal
production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons
in 1999. Vietnam's potential natural gas reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic
meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural
gas. Hydroelectric power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam
confirmed plans to build a nuclear power plant with Russian assistance, and a
second by a Japanese group.

From 2019 onwards, renewable energy deployment in Vietnam accelerated, by far
surpassing the other Southeast Asian countries. Most of the newly deployed
renewable energy was in the form of solar and wind power plants. By 2023,
however, this development had slowed down, mainly due to limited electrical
grid capacity and reduced government support.

### Industry and manufacturing

VinFast, Vietnam's first global automaker has its manufacturing facility in
Hải Phòng.

Although the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed
only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was
attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector
grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of
GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce.

From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%.
The top manufacturing sectors — electronics, food processing, cigarettes and
tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods — experienced rapid growth.
Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is
becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese
firms. For instance, Samsung produces about 40% of its phones in Vietnam.

As of 2019, Samsung employs over 200,000 employees in the Hanoi-area of
Vietnam to produce smartphones, while offsourcing some manufacturing to China
and manufacturing large portions of its phones in India. LG Electronics moved
smartphone production to Vietnam from South Korea, in order to stay
competitive. LG said that "Vietnam provides an "abundant labor force", as
motivation for the move.

Of note, Samsung accounted for 15 percent of Vietnam's exports in the first
seven months of 2024. Although significant, this is a decrease from 2017,
during which Samsung accounted for 22.7 percent of Vietnam's exports.

In the past decade, a significant automotive industry has been
developed.[_citation needed_]

### Services and tourism

In 2004, services accounted for 38.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). From
1994 to 2004, GDP attributable to the service sector grew at an average annual
rate of 6.0%.

#### Tourism

In 2012, Vietnam received 6.8 million international visitors and the number is
expected to reach over 7 million in 2013. Vietnam keeps emerging as an
attractive destination. In TripAdvisor's list of top 25 destinations Asia 2013
by travelers' choice, there are four cities of Vietnam, namely Hanoi, Ho Chi
Minh City, Hoi An and Ha Long.[_citation needed_]

2016 was the first year ever which Vietnam received over 10 million
international visitors. Since then, this figure has continued to rise. In
2019, Vietnam with 18 million international visitors was fifth most visited
country in the Asia-Pacific region as per World Tourism rankings released by
the United Nations World Tourism Organization.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, the country suspended issuance of all
tourist visas from March 2020 and recorded a 98% year-on-year drop in foreign
visitors for April 2020. Furthermore, Total tourism revenues dropped by over
60% year-on-year for July 2020. The country reopened to international arrivals
in March of 2022.

In the first six months of 2024, Vietnam received 6,943,961 tourist arrivals
representing an increase over the same period in 2023 of 65.7 percent.

### Export of labour

The export of labour, that is the sending of Vietnamese workers to work in
other countries, is also key to the Vietnamese economy, with much of their
earnings being sent back to Vietnam. This labour export was disrupted due to
the Covid pandemic, however by 2022, Vietnam hopes to send 90,000 workers
abroad. Traditional destinations have included South Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
the Republic of China, and now Vietnam is aiming for Germany, Russia, and
Israel.

### Banking and finance

#### Banking

The most important banks are the state-owned VietinBank, BIDV, and
Vietcombank, which dominate the banking sector. There is also a trend of
foreign investment into profitable banks. For example, VietinBank is currently
owned by Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (19.73%) while Vietcombank is owned by
Mizuho (15%).

#### Finance

Vietnam has two stock trading centers, the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading
Center and the Hanoi Securities Trading Center, which run the Ho Chi Minh
Stock Exchange (HOSE) and the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), respectively.
However, there is also a third market, the Unlisted Public Companies market
(UPCOM) which is a part of the Hanoi Stock Exchange. Together these two
trading centres and three exchanges come under the purview of the Vietnam
Stock Exchange (VSE). The VSE is a legislated body overseen by the State
Securities Commission (SSC) which is a branch of the Ministry of Finance. This
structure was established through the Law on Securities 2019.

## Currency, exchange rate and inflation

Countries or territories by GDP (nominal) per capita in 2022. Countries or
territories by GDP (PPP) per capita in 2022.

The currency used in Vietnam is the đồng, shortened as VND or đ.

### Exchange rate

The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese đồng is important
because the dong, although not freely convertible, is loosely pegged to the
dollar through an arrangement known as a "crawling peg". This mechanism allows
the dollar–dong exchange rate to adjust gradually to changing market
conditions. This was set at 3 percent either side of a fixed rate set each day
by the SBV, however, it was increased to 5 percent in October of 2022.

As of December 27, 2024, a US dollar is worth 25,448 Vietnamese đồng.

Gold still maintains its position as a physical currency to a certain extent,
although it has seen its economic role declining in recent years.

### Inflation

Vietnam saw high inflation in 1980s. During this period, there was excessive
demand for the industrial sector development, food, and other commodities. In
order to stimulate supply, government attempted co-integration of parallel and
planned market. Though the initial reform in the 1980s raised the total
output, due to the report being partial, it also led to the CPI inflation rate
being pushed to 200% in 1982. To tackle this, the government introduced forced
savings, which can be understood as the accumulation of unspent money to make
the monetary overhang.[_clarification needed_]

Vietnam's economy experienced a hyperinflation period in its early years of
the extensive reform program, especially from 1987 to 1992.

In 2008, inflation was tracking at 20.3% for the first half of the year,
higher than the 3.4% in 2000, but down significantly from 160% in 1988.

In 2010, inflation stood at 11.5%, and 18.58% in 2011.

At the end of 2012, inflation stood at 7.5%, a substantial decrease from 2011.

In 2013, inflation stood at 6%, and 4.09% in 2014. In 2016, it was only 2%.

## Mergers and acquisitions

With 1,120 inbound deals with a cumulated value of almost 15 billion USD,
there is a demonstrated interest by foreign companies to access the Vietnamese
market or continue expansion using mergers and acquisitions. From 1991 to
February 2018, Vietnamese companies were involved as either an acquiror or an
acquired company in 4,000 mergers and acquisitions with a total value of 40.6
billion USD. The mergers and acquisitions activities faced many obstacles,
lowering the rate of success of the transaction. Common obstacles come from
culture, transparency and legal aspects. The Institute for Mergers,
Acquisitions and Alliances that has been active in Vietnam since 2006 and its
M&A expert Christopher Kummer think that after the peak in 2016 and 2017 the
trend will decrease in 2018. Among the largest and most prominent transactions
since 2000 are:

Date Announced  | Acquiror Name  | Acquiror Nation  | Target Name  | Target Nation  | Value of Transaction ($mil)

All of the top 10 deals are inbound into Vietnam and none are outbound.

## Trade

Saigon Port is the busiest container port in Vietnam. It is capable of
accommodating post-Panamax ships.

Economic relations with the United States are improving but are not without
challenges. Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark
bilateral agreement in December 2001, which helped increase Vietnam's exports
to the United States, disagreements over textile and catfish exports are
hindering full implementation of the agreement. Further disrupting the
economic relations between the two countries were efforts in Congress to link
non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam's human rights record. Barriers to trade and
intellectual property are also within the purview of bilateral discussions.

Given neighboring China's rapid economic ascendancy, Vietnam highly values its
economic relationship with China. Following the resolution of most territorial
disputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported
more products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member,
and China announced plans to establish the world's largest free-trade area by
2010.

Vietnam became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on January 11,
2007.

In December 2015, Vietnam joined the ASEAN Economic Community along with the 9
other ASEAN members. The community's goal is to integrate the 10 members of
ASEAN and bring a freer flow of labor, investment and trade to the region.

Currently, Vietnam is being tugged in multiple directions from multiple
powers, namely, Russia, China and the U.S. in its attempts to achieve economic
multilateralization. Alternatively in the region, it is also pulled by either
China, South Korea, Japan or ASEAN countries, as well as other constituents
such as Taiwan & Hong Kong as well as Australia/New Zealand and India in the
region (ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6).

### Foreign trade

Since Đổi Mới in 1986, Vietnam has increased trading, growing both exports and
imports in double digits ever since. More recently, alarms on trade account
deficits have been raised domestically, especially after joining the WTO in
2007. Throughout the next five years after 2007, Vietnam ran a trade deficit
with the rest of the world in the tens of billions of dollars, with the record
trade deficit in 2008 of US$18 billion.

The account deficit has since decreased. In 2012, Vietnam recorded a trade
surplus of US$780 million, the first trade surplus since 1993. Total trade
reached US$228.13 billion, an increase of 12.1% from 2011. In 2013, Vietnam
recorded the second year of trade surplus of US$863 million. In 2014, Vietnam
recorded the third year of trade surplus of US$2.14 billion, the largest trade
surplus ever in history. Three years later, in 2017, it surpassed itself with
a record of $2.92 billion.

#### Exports

A map of Vietnamese export destinations, 2004

In 2004, Vietnam's exports of merchandise were valued at US$26.5 billion, and
were growing rapidly along with imports. Vietnam's principal exports were
crude oil (22.1%), textiles and garments (17.1%), footwear (10.5%), fisheries
products (9.4%) and electronics (4.1%). The main destinations of Vietnam's
exports were the United States (18.8%), Japan (13.2%), China (10.3%),
Australia (6.9%), Singapore (5.2%), Germany (4.0%), and the United Kingdom
(3.8%).

In 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion. Vietnam's main export
market included the EU with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion,
ASEAN with $US 17.8 billion, Japan with US$13.9 billion, China with US$14.2
billion, and South Korea with US$7 billion.

In 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of
electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008.
Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued
about US$17.9 billion in 2013.

In 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and
electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the
three main export groups of Vietnam. The United States continued to be
Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The EU is second with
US$27.9 billion, ASEAN is third, China is fourth and Japan is the fifth
largest export market of Vietnam.

In 2024, Vietnam's exports increased 14.3 percent. Among Vietnam's biggest
exports were garments and textiles (US$37 billion), electronics (US$72.6
billion), plastics (US$11.8 billion) and furniture (US$3.4 billion).

#### Imports

In 2004, Vietnam's merchandise imports were valued at US$31.5 billion and
growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined
petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and
cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), Taiwan
(11.6%), Singapore (11.3%), Japan (11.1%), South Korea (10.4%), Thailand
(5.8%), and Malaysia (3.8%).

Vietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion. Major import
countries were China US$29.2 billion, ASEAN with US$22.3 billion, South Korea
with US$16.2 billion, Japan with US$13.7 billion, EU with US$10 billion, and
United States with US$6.3 billion.

In 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are
materials and machinery needed for export. China continued to be Vietnam's
largest import partner, with US$43.7 billion. The ASEAN is second with US$23.1
billion, South Korea is third, Japan is fourth and the EU is the fifth largest
import partner of Vietnam.

### External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment

In 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.

From 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI)
commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been
dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and
environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. In 2003, new foreign direct
investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for
licensed FDI is industry and construction. Other sectors attracting FDI are
oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation
and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped
to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of
7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a
risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the Japan External Trade
Organization of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the
respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and
skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and
the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment,
according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for
the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index
in 2004. A study was conducted to examine the effect foreign investment had on
corruption in Vietnam. The study concluded that the propensity of foreign
firms to bribe at entry is higher in restricted sectors. Also, the removal of
investment restrictions leads to reductions in bribery as a result of more
Foreign Investment Enterprises, and consequently more competition entering
that sector.

The World Bank's assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to
support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and
sustainable development and to promote good governance. From 1993 through
2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of official development
assistance (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In
2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65
billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of
disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.
From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of
ODA.

Pledged foreign direct investment was US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record
US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008. Mergers and acquisitions have
gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy,
especially after 2005.

In 2023, Vietnam realised foreign direct investment in the amount of US$23.2
billion and recorded a further US$36.6 billion in registered FDI commitments.

### Trade liberalization

Over the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with
different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing
hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it
signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by
admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has
further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements
with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few.
Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-
Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US,
in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote
economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP
TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to
productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs
on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade
balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018
(Vietnam Custom Department). Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed
the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after
10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which
managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South
Korea, and Singapore)

### Domestic reform

The government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open
market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in
place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law
on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam.
Between 1981 and 2005, Vietnam created a new intellectual property law that
gradually moved away from the Soviet-style concept of collective ownership. A
milestone in this evolution was the _Copyright Agreement_ that Vietnam
concluded with the US in 1997, serving primarily the US interest of preventing
Vietnam from becoming an international center for illegal copying. The
constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly
to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to
reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global
Competitiveness Report by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017,
rising from 77th place in 2006. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business
rankings, Vietnam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017.
The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing
access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.

### Human and physical capital investment

Vietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing
population – 100 million as of 2024, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than
half are under the age of 35– Vietnam made large public investments in
education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This
was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy
for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing
sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure,
ensuring cheap mass access to necessities like electricity, water, and
especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a
hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and
Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built
factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile
operations in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010,
signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of
the international business community.

### Sustainable growth

Economic growth in Vietnam was considered as broadly in line with other
developing countries. The Inclusive Development Index by WEF put Vietnam in a
group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the
ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident
with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force
participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other
countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are
generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment
rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls
continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively
reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official
Development Strategy Action Plan 2011–2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms
for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of
each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify
the fruit of development.

In 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the
ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development
of the "One Strategic Plan", integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-
Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan
(2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to
implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of
importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental
sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance.
Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth
policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done
in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so
that a common framework can be set forward.
