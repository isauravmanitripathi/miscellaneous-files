The **economy of Mongolia** has traditionally been based on agriculture and
livestock. Mongolia also has extensive mineral deposits: copper, coal,
molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial
production. Soviet assistance, at its height one-third of gross domestic
product (GDP), disappeared almost overnight in 1990–91, in the time of the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Mongolia was driven into deep recession.

Economic growth picked up in 1997–99 after stalling in 1996 due to a series of
natural disasters and increases in world prices of copper and cashmere. Public
revenues and exports collapsed in 1998 and 1999 due to the repercussions of
the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In August and September 1999, the economy
suffered from a temporary Russian ban on exports of oil and oil products.
Mongolia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997. The international
donor community pledged over $300 million per year in the last Consultative
Group Meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar in June 1999. Recently, the Mongolian
economy has grown at a fast pace due to an increase in mining and Mongolia
attained a GDP growth rate of 11.7% in 2013. However, because much of this
growth is export-based, Mongolia is suffering from the global slowdown in
mining caused by decreased growth in China.

## Economic history

Historical development of real GDP per capita in Mongolia

### Socialist era

The rapid political changes of 1990–91 marked the beginning of Mongolia's
efforts to develop a market economy, but these efforts have been complicated
and disrupted by the dissolution and continuing deterioration of the economy
of the former Soviet Union. Prior to 1991, 80% of Mongolia's trade was with
the former Soviet Union, and 15% was with other Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance (CMEA) countries. Mongolia was heavily dependent upon the former
Soviet Union for fuel, medicine, and spare parts for its factories and power
plants.[_citation needed_]

The former Soviet Union served as the primary market for Mongolian industry.
In the 1980s, Mongolia's industrial sector became increasingly important. By
1989, it accounted for an estimated 34% of material products, compared to 18%
from agriculture. However, minerals, animals, and animal-derived products
still constitute a large proportion of the country's exports. Principal
imports included machinery, petroleum, cloth, and building materials.

In the late 1980s, the government began to improve links with non-communist
Asia and the West, and tourism in Mongolia developed. As of 1 January 1991,
Mongolia and the former Soviet Union agreed to conduct bilateral trade in hard
currency at world prices.

Despite its external trade difficulties, Mongolia has continued to press ahead
with reform. Privatization of small shops and enterprises has largely been
completed in the 1990s, and most prices have been freed. Privatization of
large state enterprises has begun. Tax reforms also have begun, and the barter
and official exchange rates were unified in late 1991.

### Transition to a market economy

Between 1990 and 1993, Mongolia suffered triple-digit inflation, rising
unemployment, shortages of basic goods, and food rationing. During that
period, economic output contracted by one-third. As market reforms and private
enterprise took hold, economic growth began again in 1994–95. Unfortunately,
since this growth was fueled in part by over-allocation of bank credit,
especially to the remaining state-owned enterprises, economic growth was
accompanied by a severe weakening of the banking sector. GDP grew by about 6%
in 1995, thanks to largely to a boom in copper prices. Average real economic
growth leveled off to about 3.5% in 1996–99 due to the 1997 Asian financial
crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and worsening commodity prices,
especially copper and gold.

Mongolia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell from 3.2% in 1999 to 1.3%
in 2000. The decline can be attributed to the loss of 2.4 million livestock in
bad weather and natural disasters in 2000. Prospects for development outside
the traditional reliance on nomadic, livestock-based agriculture are
constrained by Mongolia's landlocked location and lack of basic
infrastructure. Since 1990, more than 1,500 foreign companies from 61
countries have invested[_when?_] a total of $338.3 million in Mongolia. By
2003 private companies made up 70% of Mongolian GDP and 80% of exports.

Until recently, there have been a very few restrictions on foreign investments
during most of Mongolia's post-socialist period. Consequently, mining
industry's contribution to FDI increased to almost 25% in 1999 from zero in
1990.

### Economic development present day

Mongolia's reliance on trade with China meant that the 2008 financial crisis
had a major effect, severely stunting the growth of its economy. With the
sharp decrease in metal prices, especially copper (down 65% from July
2008-February 2009), exports of its raw materials withered and by 2009 the
stock market MSE Top-20 registered an all-time low since its dramatic spike in
mid-2007. Just as the economy started to recover, Mongolia was hit by a Zud
over the winter period of 2009–2010, causing many livestock to perish and thus
severely affecting cashmere production which accounts for a further 7% of the
country's export revenues.

According to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund estimates, real
GDP growth reduced from 8% to 2.7% in 2009, and exports shrunk 26% from $2.5Bn
to $1.9Bn before a promisingly steady increase up until 2008. Because of this,
it was projected that between 20,000 and 40,000 fewer Mongolians (0.7% and
1.4% of the population respectively) will be lifted out of poverty, than would
have been the case without the 2008 financial crisis.

In late 2009 and the beginning of 2010, however, the market has begun to
recover once again. Having identified and learnt from its previous economic
instabilities, legislative reform and a tightened fiscal policy promises to
guide the country onwards and upwards. In February 2010, foreign assets were
recorded at USD1,569,449 million. New trade agreements are being formed and
foreign investors are keeping a close eye on the "Asian Wolf".

Mining is the principal industrial activity in Mongolia, making up 30% of all
Mongolian industry. Another important industry is the production of cashmere.
Mongolia is the world's second largest producer of cashmere, with the main
company, Gobi Cashmere, accounting for 21% of world cashmere production as of
2006.

Total export in 2019 was US$7.6 billion.

The 2022 economic growth is expected to be one percent and international
institutions anticipate the economy to speed up by at least six percent in
2023 from expanded commodity exports. A significant commodity export boom is
expected starting from 2023 with new coal rail networks Error in Webarchive

from Rio Tinto’s underground mine Oyu Tolgoi in southern Mongolia.

In early 2020s, Mongolia's economy, though experiencing growth spurred by
natural resource exports, faces challenges. Over-reliance on mining, rising
debt, inflation, and potential fuel supply disruptions from Russia pose risks
to the country's economic stability despite government efforts in
infrastructure and social programs.

## The Wolf Economy

The term was coined and subsequently popularized by Renaissance Capital in
their report "Mongolia: "Blue-sky opportunity". They state that Mongolia is
set to become the new Asian tiger, or "Mongolian wolf" as they prefer to call
it, and predict "unstoppable" economic growth. With the recent developments in
the mining industry and foreign interest increasing at an astonishing rate, it
is claimed that the 'Wolf Economy' looks ready to pounce. The term's
aggressive title mirrors the country's attitude in the capital markets, and
with newfound mineral prospects it has the chance to retain its title as one
of the world's fastest growing economies.

## Banks

Mongolian Stock Exchange

The banking sector is highly concentrated, with five banks controlling about
80% of financial assets as of 2015: Shares of Mongolia's five largest domestic
banks are to be offered to the public for the first time on the soon-to-be
partially privatized Mongolian Stock Exchange.

### Commercial banks

  * KhasBank \- KhasBank is a community development bank and microfinance institution headquartered in Ulaanbaatar, with a nationwide network of 100 offices and 1309 staff as of June 2012.
  * Khan Bank \- Khan Bank has its central office in Ulaanbaatar, where 5 branches are located. It has 24 regional branch offices throughout the country, each of which supervises an additional 15 to 25 smaller branches in its area, totaling 512.
  * Golomt Bank \- Golomt Bank started in 1995 and now manages around 23% of the assets in the domestic banking system. Recently begun its stock sales.
  * Trade and Development Bank \- TDB was formed in 1990 and is thus the oldest bank in Mongolia. It has a network of 28 branches and settlement centers, 60 ATMs, 1300 POS terminals, and Internet/SMS banking throughout the country. Foreign banks like ING are breaking into the market.
  * Other lesser banks are: M-Bank, State bank, Capitron Bank, Arig Bank, Bogd Bank, and Chinggis Bank.

In terms of access to credit, Mongolia ranked 61st out of 189 economies in
accordance with 2015 Ease of Doing Business survey. However, Mongolia had one
of the highest banking branch penetration rates in the world at 1 bank branch
per 15,257 residents as of May 2015.

### Investment banks

With a strengthening capital market environment, many foreign and local
investment institutions have begun to establish themselves in Mongolia. The
most prominent local agencies include: TDB Capital Archived 31 December 2019

Archived 18 August 2020 at the Wayback Machine, and Frontier Securities.

## Environment

As a result of rapid urbanization and industrial growth policies under the
communist regime, Mongolia's deteriorating environment has become a major
concern. The burning of soft coal coupled with thousands of factories in
Ulaanbaatar and a sharp increase in individual motorization has resulted in
severe air pollution. Deforestation, overgrazed pastures, and, less recently,
efforts to increase grain and hay production by plowing up more virgin land
have increased soil erosion from wind and rain.
