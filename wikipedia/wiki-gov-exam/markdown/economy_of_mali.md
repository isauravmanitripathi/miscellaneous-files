The **economy of Mali** is based to a large extent upon agriculture, with a
mostly rural population engaged in subsistence agriculture.

Mali is among the ten poorest nations of the world and is one of the 37
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. Mali is a major recipient of foreign aid from
many sources, including multilateral organizations (most significantly the
World Bank, the African Development Bank, and Arab Funds), and bilateral
programs funded by the European Union, France, the United States, Canada, the
Netherlands, and Germany. Before 1991, the former Soviet Union, China and the
Warsaw Pact countries had been a major source of economic and military aid.

The per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Mali was $820 in 1999. Mali's
great potential wealth lies in mining and the production of agricultural
commodities, livestock, and fish. The most productive agricultural area lies
along the banks of the Niger River, the Inner Niger Delta and the southwestern
region around Sikasso. Mali advovates for a traditional economic system.

## Agriculture

The major agricultural region in southern Mali, showing isohyet lines and crop
intensity percentages. Mali's most productive agricultural region is located
between Bamako and Mopti. Irrigation water is used mainly for rice while
cotton is grown as a rainfed crop. (USDA: 2001)

In 2018, Mali produced:

  * 3.8 million tons of maize;
  * 3.1 million tons of rice;
  * 1.8 million tons of millet;
  * 1.5 million tons of sorghum;
  * 814 thousand tons of mango (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 710 thousand tons of cotton (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 551 thousand tons of watermelon;
  * 522 thousand tons of onion;
  * 512 thousand tons of okra;
  * 370 thousand tons of sugar cane;
  * 368 thousand tons of peanuts;
  * 312 thousand tons of sweet potato;
  * 303 thousand tons of potato;
  * 226 thousand tons of sheanut;
  * 215 thousand tons of cowpea;
  * 196 thousand tons of banana;
  * 167 thousand tons of cashew nuts (8th largest producer in the world);
  * 159 thousand tons of beans;
  * 159 thousand tons of tomato;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

Agricultural activities occupy 70% of Mali's labor force and provide 42% of
the GDP. Cotton and livestock make up 75%–80% of Mali's annual exports. Small-
scale traditional farming dominates the agricultural sector, with subsistence
farming (of cereals, primarily sorghum, pearl millet, and maize) on about 90%
of the 14,000 square kilometres (1,400,000 ha; 3,500,000 acres) under
cultivation.

The most productive agricultural area lies along the banks of the Niger River
between Bamako and Mopti and extends south to the borders of Guinea, Ivory
Coast, and Burkina Faso. Average rainfall varies in this region from 500 mm
(20 in) per year around Mopti to 1,400 mm (55 in) in the south near Sikasso.
This area is most important for the production of cotton, rice, pearl millet,
maize, vegetables, tobacco and tree crops.

Annual rainfall, critical for Mali's agriculture, has been at or above average
since 1993. Cereal production, including rice, has grown annually, and the
1997–98 cotton harvest reached a record 500,000 tons.

Until the mid-1960s, Mali was self-sufficient in grains — pearl millet,
sorghum, rice and maize. Diminished harvests during bad years, a growing
population, changing dietary habits, and, most importantly, policy constraints
on agricultural production resulted in grain deficits almost every year from
1965 to 1986.

Production has rebounded since 1987 due to agricultural policy reforms
undertaken by the government and supported by the Western donor nations.
Liberalization of producer prices and an open cereals market have created
incentives to production. These reforms, combined with adequate rainfall,
successful integrated rural agriculture programs in the south, and improved
management of the Office du Niger, have led to surplus cereal production over
the past five years.

### Rice

Rice planting in Mali

Rice is grown extensively along the banks of the Niger between Ségou and
Mopti, with the most important rice-producing area at the Office du Niger,
located north of Ségou toward the Mauritanian border. Using water diverted
from the Niger, the Office du Niger irrigates about 600 km2 (230 sq mi) of
land for rice and sugarcane production. About one-third of Mali's paddy rice
is produced at the Office du Niger.

### Sorghum

Sorghum is planted extensively in the drier parts of the country and along the
banks of the Niger in eastern Mali, as well as in the lake beds in the Niger
delta region. During the wet season, farmers near the town of Dire have
cultivated wheat on irrigated fields for hundreds of years. Peanuts are grown
throughout the country but are concentrated in the area around Kita, west of
Bamako.

### Livestock

In 2019, Mali produced 276 million liters of cow's milk, 270 million liters of
camel milk, 243 million liters of goat milk, 176 million liters of sheep's
milk, 187 thousand tons of beef, 64 thousand tons of lamb meat, 54 thousand
tons of chicken meat, among others.

Mali's resource in livestock consists of millions of cattle, sheep, and goats.
Approximately 40% of Mali's herds were lost during the great drought in
1972–74. The level was gradually restored, but the herds were again decimated
in the 1983–85 drought. The overall size of Mali's herds is not expected to
reach pre-drought levels in the north of the country, where encroachment of
the desert has forced many nomadic herders to abandon pastoral activities and
turn instead to farming.

The largest concentrations of cattle are in the areas north of Bamako and
Ségou extending into the Niger delta, but herding activity is gradually
shifting southward, due to the effects of previous droughts. Sheep, goats, and
camels are raised to the exclusion of cattle in the dry areas north and east
of Timbuktu.

## Fishing

The Niger River is also an important source of fish, providing food for
riverside communities; the surplus—smoked, salted, and dried—is exported. Due
to drought and diversion of river water for agriculture, fish production has
steadily declined since the early 1980s.

## Mining and resources

Drilling for oil in the Taoudeni basin

Mining has long been an important aspect of the Malian economy. Gold, the
largest source of Malian exports, is still mined in the southern region and at
the end of the 20th century Mali had the third highest gold production in
Africa (after South Africa and Ghana). These goldfields, the largest of which
lie in the Bambouk Mountains in western Mali (Kenieba Cercle), were a major
source of wealth and trade as far back as the Ghana Empire.

Salt mining in the far north, especially in the Saharan oases of Taoudenni and
Taghaza have been a crucial part of the Malian economy for at least seven
hundred years. Both resources were vital components of the Trans-Saharan
trade, stretching back to the time of the Roman Empire.

From the 1960s to the 1990s state owned mining—especially for gold—expanded,
followed by a period of expansion by international contract mining.

In 1991, following the lead of the International Development Association, Mali
relaxed the enforcement of mining codes which led to greater foreign
investment in the mining industry. From 1994 to 2007, national and foreign
companies were granted around 150 operating licences along with more than 25
certificates for exploitation and more than 200 research permits. Gold mining
in Mali has increased dramatically, with more than 50 tonnes in 2007 from less
than half a tonne produced annually at the end of the 1980s. Mining revenue
totaled some 300 billion CFA francs in 2007 more than a thirty times increase
from the 1995 total national mining revenue of less than 10 billion CFA.
Government revenues from mining contracts, less than 1% of the state income in
1989 were almost 18% in 2007.

### Gold

In 2019, the country was the 16th largest world producer of gold.

Gold accounted for some 80% of mining activity in the mid-2000s, while there
remained considerable proven reserves of other minerals not currently
exploited. Gold has become Mali's largest export, after cotton—historically
the basis of Mali's export industry—and livestock. The emergence of gold as
Mali's leading export product since 1999 has helped mitigate some of the
negative impacts caused by fluctuations in world cotton markets and loss of
trade from the Ivorian Civil War to the south. Large private investments in
gold mining include Anglogold-Ashanti ($250 million) in Sadiola and Yatela,
and Randgold Resources ($140 million) in Morila – both multinational South
African companies located respectively in the north-western and southern parts
of the country.

#### Social and environmental impacts

While great incomes are produced, most staff employed in the mining industries
are from outside Mali, and residents in the areas of intensive mining complain
of little benefit from the industry. Populations complain of displacement for
the construction of mines: at Sadiola Gold Mine, 43 villages have lost some
land to the mine there, while in Fourou, near the large Syama goldmines, 121
villages saw some displacement.

In addition, the continued exploitation of unregulated small scale mining,
often by child laborers, supplies a large international gold market in Bamako
which feeds into international production. Recent criticism has surfaced
around the working conditions, pay, and the widespread use of child labor in
these small gold mines (as reported recently in the U.S. Department of Labor's
_List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor_), and the method with
which middlemen, in regional centers like Sikasso and Kayes, purchase and
transport gold. Gold collected in the towns is sold on—with almost no
regulation or oversight—to larger merchant houses in Bamako or Conakry, and
eventually to smelters in Europe. Ecological factors, especially pollution of
water by mine tailings, is a major source of concern.

### Other minerals

Other mining operations include kaolin, salt, phosphate, and limestone. The
government is trying to generate interest in the potential of extracting
petroleum from the Taoudeni basin.

## Manufacturing

Malian export destinations in 2006

During the colonial period, private capital investment was virtually
nonexistent, and public investment was devoted largely to the Office du Niger
irrigation scheme and to administrative expenses. Following independence, Mali
built some light industries with the help of various donors. Manufacturing,
consisting principally of processed agricultural products, accounted for about
8% of the GDP in 1990.

## Economic reform

Between 1992 and 1995, Mali implemented an economic adjustment program that
resulted in economic growth and a reduction in financial imbalances. This was
reflected in the increased GDP growth rates (9.6% in 2002) and decreased
inflation. GDP in 2002 amounted to US$3.2 billion, made up of agriculture
37.8%, industry 26.4% and services 35.9%.

Effective implementation of macroeconomic stabilization and economic
liberalization policies and the stable political situation resulted in good
economic performance and enabled Mali to strengthen the foundations for a
market-oriented economy and encourage private sector development, backed up by
significant progress in implementing the country's privatization program.
Agricultural reform measures were aimed at diversifying and expanding
production as well as at reducing costs.

Mali's economic performance is fragile, characterized by a vulnerability to
climatic conditions, fluctuating terms of trade, dependence on ports in
neighboring countries.

Mali produces cotton, cereals and rice. Although locally produced rice now
provides competition to imported Asian rice, Mali's primary export is cotton.
Livestock exports and industry (producing vegetable and cottonseed oils, and
textiles) have experienced growth. Although most of Mali is desert or semi-
desert, the Niger River is a potential irrigation source. Exports are in three
primary sector products (56% gold, 27% cotton, 5% livestock). Ivory Coast is
where most of the country's trade goes through and the crisis previously
experienced here had a negative effect on Mali's economy.

The mining industry in Mali has recently attracted renewed interest and
investment from foreign companies. Gold and phosphate are the only minerals
mined in Mali although deposits of copper and diamonds do also exist. The
emergence of gold as Mali's leading export product since 1999 has helped
mitigate some of the negative impact of the cotton and Ivory Coast crises.

The development of the oil industry is important due to the country's
dependence on the importation of all petroleum products from neighbouring
states. Electricity is provided by the parastatal utility, Electricite du
Mali.

## Foreign aid

Mali residents are mostly French speaking. Mali is a major recipient of
foreign aid from many sources, including multilateral organizations (most
significantly the World Bank, African Development Bank, and Arab Funds), and
bilateral programs funded by the European Union, France, United States,
Canada, Netherlands, and Germany. Cooperation from Brazil has been growing
quickly, especially in cotton production, by means of developing cotton seeds
adapted to the Malian soil. Since 2009, Brazilian cooperation in Mali has
raised the quality of the cotton fields and their productivity. Brazilian aide
has also started since 2019 in cattle raising and the recovery of eroded soils
for agriculture. Before 1991, the former Soviet Union had been a major source
of economic and military aid, including construction of a cement plant and the
Kalana gold mine.

Currently, aid from Russia is restricted mainly to training and provision of
spare parts. Chinese aid remains high, and Chinese-Malian joint venture
companies have become more numerous in the last 3 years, leading to the
opening of a Chinese investment center. The Chinese are major participants in
the textile industry and in large scale construction projects, including a
bridge across the Niger, a conference center, an expressway in Bamako, and a
stadium in Bamako completed in 2001 for the Africa Cup competition in 2002,
named Stade du 26 Mars.

In 1998, U.S. assistance reached over $40 million. This included $39 million
in sector support through United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) programs, largely channeled to local communities through private
voluntary agencies; Peace Corps program budget of $2.2 million for more than
160 Volunteers serving in Mali; Self Help and the Democracy Funds of $170,500;
and $650,000 designated for electoral support. Military assistance includes
$275,000 for the International Military Education Training (IMET) program,
$1.6 million for the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI), $60,000 for
Joint Combined Exercise Training (JCET), and $100,000 for Humanitarian
Assistance.
