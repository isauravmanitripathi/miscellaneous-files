The **economy of Azerbaijan** is highly dependent on oil and gas exports, in
particular since the completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. The
transition to oil production in the late 1990s led to rapid economic growth
over the period 1995–2014. Since 2014, GDP growth has slowed down
substantially.

Large oil reserves are a major contributor to Azerbaijan's economy. Gas and
oil make up two-thirds of Azerbaijan's GDP, making it one of the top ten most
fossil fuel-dependent economies in the world. Gas and oil make up 90% of
Azerbaijan's export revenues and 60% of its finances.

Azerbaijan's economy is characterized by corruption and inequality. The
country's oil wealth has significantly strengthened the stability of Ilham
Aliyev's regime and enriched ruling elites in Azerbaijan. The country's oil
wealth has enabled the state to host lavish international events, as well as
engage in extensive lobbying efforts abroad.

The national currency is the Azerbaijani manat. The private sector is weak in
Azerbaijan, as the economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises. More than
half of the formal labor force works for the government in Azerbaijan.

## Economic history of Azerbaijan

### Republic era

Oil and gas are the most prominent products of Azerbaijan's economy. More than
$60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil sector by major international
oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by BP. Oil production under the
first of these production sharing agreements (PSAs), with the Azerbaijan
International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and was about 500,000
barrels per day in 2006. People visit petroleum spas (or "oil spas") to bathe
in the local crude in Naftalan. A leading caviar producer and exporter in the
past, Azerbaijan's fishing industry today is concentrated on the dwindling
stocks of sturgeon and beluga in the Caspian Sea.

Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making
the transition from a command to a market economy, but its energy resources
brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on
economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being
replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including foreign investment, is
the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

In 1992 Azerbaijan became a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization.
In 2002, the Azerbaijani merchant marine had 54 ships.

In 2010 Azerbaijan entered into the top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU
countries with €9.46 billion. In 2011, the amount of foreign investments in
Azerbaijan was $20 billion, a 61% increase from 2010. According to Minister of
Economic Development of Azerbaijan, Shahin Mustafayev, in 2011, "$15.7 billion
was invested in the non-oil sector, while the rest – in the oil sector".

Azerbaijani exports in 2006

In 2012, because of its economic performance after the Soviet breakup,
Azerbaijan was predicted to become "Tiger of Caucasus". In 2012, Globalization
and World Cities Research Network study ranked Baku as a Gamma-level global
city.

In 2015, Turkey and Azerbaijan agreed to boost mutual trade to US$15 billion
by 2023.

For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been
petroleum, which represented 50 percent of Azerbaijan's GDP in 2005, and is
projected to double to almost 125 percent of GDP in 2007. Now that Western oil
companies are able to tap deep-water oilfields untouched by the Soviets
because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important
areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven oil reserves in
the Caspian Basin, which Azerbaijan shares with Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and
Turkmenistan, are comparable in size to the North Sea, although exploration is
still in the early stages.

## Sectors of the economy

### Agriculture

Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54.9
percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands. At the beginning of 2007 there
were 4.76 million hectares (11.8 million acres) of utilized agricultural area.
In the same year, the total wood resources counted 136 million cubic metres
(178 million cubic yards). Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research
institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and subtropical
crops, leaf vegetables, viticulture and wine-making, cotton growing and
medicinal plants. In some lands, it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes,
sugar beets, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, dairy products, and wine and
spirits are also important farm products. The Caspian fishing industry is
concentrated on the dwindling stocks of sturgeon and beluga.

Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have
begun to be produced locally (among them are Coca-Cola by Coca-Cola Bottlers
LTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating
Azerbaijan).

A new program which is prepared by the European Union is aimed to supporting
the economic diversification of Azerbaijan.

### Manufacturing

Marauder (Mine Protected Vehicle) is manufactured in Azerbaijan.

In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 percent
of the Azerbaijani economy. Diversification of the economy into manufacturing
industries remains a long-term issue.

As of the late 2000s, the defense industry of Azerbaijan has emerged as an
autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry
is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.
Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defense industries and Turkish
companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40 mm revolver grenade launchers, 107 mm
and 122 mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR
vehicles in Baku.

#### Financial and business services

The banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the Azerbaijani
economy.

#### Telecommunications

The Azerbaijan telecommunications sector is embroiled in corruption.
Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev and his family own two of Azerbaijan's
largest mobile providers (Azerfon and Azercell) through offshore companies and
potentially control three-quarters of the mobile market in Azerbaijan. The
third large mobile provider is Bakcell, which is registered as a company in an
offshore tax haven and whose owners are unknown. Ownership of the mobile
providers in Azerbaijan enables the ruling Aliyev family to monitor phone
calls and internet activity.

Investigative reporting revealed that Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and
his family made more than $1 billion when state shares of mobile operators
were transferred to a purportedly "local partner" which was in reality owned
by the Aliyev family's offshore companies.

Azerbaijan has relatively expensive call rates relative to comparable
countries. The high prices are possibly due to consolidated control of the
mobile market and a lack of competition.

The Azerbaijan government has stated that it wants to create a high-tech
sector in Azerbaijan.

#### Tourism

Petroglyphs in Gobustan dating back to 10,000 BC indicating a thriving
culture. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site considered to be of "outstanding
universal value".

Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a
well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union,
and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War during the 1988–1994 period, damaged the
tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the
country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist
visits and overnight stays. In recent years, Azerbaijan has also become a
popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism. During
winter, the Shahdag Winter Complex offers skiing.

The government of Azerbaijan has set the development of Azerbaijan as an elite
tourist destination a top priority. It is a national strategy to make tourism
a major, if not the single largest, contributor to the Azerbaijani economy.
These activities are regulated by the State Tourism Agency and the Ministry of
Culture. The Formula One Grand Prix is held in Baku, the capital city, and has
been held here for years.

## Currency system

The Azerbaijani manat is the currency of Azerbaijani, denominated as the
manat, subdivided into 100 qapik. The manat is issued by the Central Bank of
Azerbaijan, the monetary authority of Azerbaijan. The ISO 4217 abbreviation is
AZN. The Latinised symbol is ().

The manat is held in a floating exchange-rate system, managed primarily
against the US dollar. The rate of exchange (Azerbaijani manat per US$1) for
28 January 2016, was AZN 1.60.

There is a complex relationship between Azerbaijan's balance of trade,
inflation, measured by the consumer price index and the value of its currency.
Despite allowing the value of the manat to "float", Azerbaijan's central bank
has decisive ability to control its value in relationship to other currencies.

## Infrastructure

### Energy

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (green) is one of several pipelines running
from Baku.

Two-thirds of Azerbaijan is rich in oil and natural gas. The region of the
Lesser Caucasus accounts for most of the country's gold, silver, iron, copper,
titanium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum, complex ore and antimony.
In September 1994, a 30-year contract was signed between the State Oil Company
of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and 13 oil companies, among them Amoco, BP,
ExxonMobil, Lukoil and Statoil. As Western oil companies are able to tap deep-
water oilfields untouched by the Soviet exploitation, Azerbaijan is considered
one of the most important spots in the world for oil exploration and
development. Azeriqaz, a sub-company of SOCAR, intends to ensure full
gasification of the country by 2021.

### Transportation

The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international
traffic arteries, such as the Silk Road and the south–north corridor,
highlights the strategic importance of the transportation sector for the
country's economy. The transport sector in the country includes roads,
railways, aviation, and maritime transport.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw
materials. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) became operational in May
2006 and extends more than 1,774 kilometers through the territories of
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50
million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea
oilfields to global markets. The South Caucasus Pipeline, also stretching
through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at
the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from
the Shah Deniz gas field. Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296 billion
cubic meters of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in
the EU-sponsored Silk Road Project.

In 2012, the construction of Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway expected to provide
transportation between Asia and Europe through connecting the railways of
China and Kazakhstan in the east with Turkey's Marmaray to the European
railway system in the west. Broad gauge railways in 2010 stretched for 2,918
km (1,813 mi) and electrified railways numbered 1,278 km (794 mi). By 2010,
there were 35 airports and one heliport.

### Regulation

Single window system shares needed information through a single gateway with
all organizations serving in trade field, as well as abolishes useless
processes and raises the effectiveness of cooperation among different parties.
73 economies implement single window system in the world. Azerbaijan started
to implement this system in 2009. It implemented an E-Government portal as
well.

A single-window system was established by a decree of the Azerbaijani
President issued in 2007, 30 April, in order to simplify export-import
procedures, innovate customs services, and improve the trade environment. The
president appointed the State Customs Committee as the leading body of
controlling goods and transportation passing through the borders of the
country in 2008.

The State Migration Service issues appropriate permits for foreigners and
stateless persons coming to Azerbaijan to live and work. The "single window"
principle has been applied on migration management processes starting from 1
July 2009 according to the Decree.

## Poverty

As per the Asian Development Bank's estimates of 2017, 5.5% of the population
of Azerbaijan lives below the poverty line in 2022. In the same ADB report, it
was estimated that for every 1000 babies born in Azerbaijan, 18 die before
their 15th birthday.
