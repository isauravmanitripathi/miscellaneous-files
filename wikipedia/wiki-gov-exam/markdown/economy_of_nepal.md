The **economy of Nepal** is a developing category and is largely dependent on
agriculture and remittances. Until the mid-20th century Nepal was an isolated
pre-industrial society, which entered the modern era in 1951 without schools,
hospitals, roads, telecommunications, electric power, industry, or civil
service. The country has, however, made progress toward sustainable economic
growth since the 1950s. The country was opened to economic liberalization,
leading to economic growth and improvement in living standards when compared
to the past. The biggest challenges faced by the country in achieving higher
economic development are the frequent changes in political leadership, as well
as corruption.

Nepal has used a series of five-year plans in an attempt to make progress in
economic development. It completed its ninth economic development plan in
2002; its currency has been made convertible, and 17 state enterprises have
been privatised. Foreign aid to Nepal accounts for more than half of the
development budget. Government priorities over the years have been result in
the development of transportation and communication facilities, agriculture,
and industry. Since 1975, improved government administration and rural
development efforts have been emphasised. The economy is heavily dependent on
imports of basic materials and on foreign markets for its forest and
agricultural products. Nepal possesses immense potential for sustainable
energy resources that can be harnessed for energy security, economic growth,
and environmental sustainability.

Agriculture remains Nepal's principal economic activity, employing about 65%
of the population and providing 31.7% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area
is cultivable; another 40.7% is forested (i.e., covered by shrubs, pastureland
and forest); most of the rest is mountainous. Fruits and vegetables (apples,
pears, tomatoes, various salad greens, peach, nectarine, potatoes), as well as
rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces an
agricultural surplus, part of which supplies the food-deficient hill areas.

GDP is heavily dependent on remittances (9.1%) of foreign workers.
Subsequently, economic development in social services and infrastructure in
Nepal has not made dramatic progress. A countrywide primary education system
is under development, and Tribhuvan University has several campuses under it .
Although eradication efforts continue, malaria had been controlled in the
fertile but previously uninhabitable Terai region in the south. Kathmandu is
linked to India and nearby hill regions by road and an expanding highway
network. The capital was almost out of fuel and supplies, due to a crippling
general strike in southern Nepal on 17 February 2008.

Major towns are connected to the capital by telephone and domestic air
services. The export-oriented carpet and garment industries like pasmina have
grown rapidly in recent years. Together, they account for approximately 70% of
the country's merchandise exports. The Cost of Living Index in Nepal is
comparatively lower than many countries but not the least. The quality of life
has declined to a much less desirous value in recent years. In the 2021 Global
Hunger Index, Nepal ranks 76th out of the 116 countries with sufficient data
to calculate 2021 GHI scores. With a score of 19.1, Nepal has a level of
hunger that is moderate. Nepal has the worst road infrastructure in Asia.
World Economics estimates Nepal's 2024 GDP at $243 billion in PPP terms
(Purchasing Power Parity) and an initial estimate of $255 billion for 2025.
This figure is 65% higher than the official estimate published by the World
Bank.

## Foreign investments and taxation

Huge numbers of Small Foreign Investments come to Nepal via the Non Resident
Nepali, who are investing in many sectors. Nepal has a huge potential for
hydroelectricity. Accordingly, a large number of foreign companies are willing
to invest in Nepal, but political instability has stopped the process. Nepal
has entered into agreements for avoidance of double taxation (all in credit
method) with 10 countries (PSRD) since 2000. Similarly, it has Investment
protection agreements with 5 countries (PSRD) since 1983. In 2014, Nepal
restricted the Foreign aid by setting a minimum limit for foreign grants, soft
and commercial loans from its development partners.

## Imports and exports

Nepal's merchandise trade balance has improved somewhat since 2000 with the
growth of the carpet and garment industries. In the fiscal year 2000–2001,
exports posted a greater increase (14%) than imports (4.5%), helping bring the
trade deficit down by 4% from the previous year to $749 million. Recently, the
European Union has become the largest buyer of ready-made garments; fruits and
vegetables (mostly apples, pears, tomatoes, various salads, peach, nectarine,
potatoes, rice) from Nepal. Exports to the EU accounted for 46.13 percent of
the country's garment exports.

The annual monsoon rain strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to
1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in
1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%.

Strong export performance, including earnings from tourism, and external aid
have helped improve the overall balance of payments and increase international
reserves. Nepal receives substantial amounts of external assistance from the
United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Germany, and the Nordic countries.

Several multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and the UN Development Programme also provide assistance. In
June 1998, Nepal submitted its memorandum on a foreign trade regime to the
World Trade Organization and in May 2000 began direct negotiations on its
accession.

## Resources

Tourists trekking in Annapurna region in western Nepal. Tourism plays a vital
role in Nepal's economy.

Progress has been made in exploiting Nepal's natural resources, tourism, and
hydroelectricity. With eight of the world's 10 highest mountain peaks,
including Mount Everest at 8,848.86 m. In the early 1990s, one large public
sector project and a number of private projects were planned; some have been
completed. The most significant private sector financed hydroelectric projects
currently in operation are the Khimti Khola (60 MW) and the Bhote Koshi
Project (36 MW). The project is still undergoing and has dependency on China,
India and Japan to take the further steps.

Upper Tamakoshi hydropower, biggest hydropower in Nepal. Kulekhani dam also
known as "Indra sarobar"or "Kulekhani Reservoir" combinely producing 106 MW,
in Makwanpur, Nepal Middle Marsyangdi Hydropower Station, producing 70 MW.
Nepal has significant potential to generate hydropower, which it plans to
export across South Asia.

Nepal has 83,000 MW of theoretical and 42,133 MW of technically/financially
viable hydroelectric potential, however the total installed capacity, at
present, is 2500 MW and increasing.

The environmental impact of Nepal's hydroelectric Own calendar (Bikram Sambat)
New year in mid- April projects has been limited by the fact that most are
"run-of-the-river" with only one storage project undertaken to date. The
largest hydroelectric plant under consideration is the West Seti Dam (750 MW)
storage project dedicated to exports to be built by the private sector.
Negotiations with India for a power purchase agreement have been underway for
several years, but agreement on pricing and financing remains a problem.
Currently demand for electricity is increasing at 8-10% a year whereas Nepal's
option to have agreement with India will make this fulfilment against demand.
As of June 2022 surplus electricity up to 364 MWp by Nepal is exported to
India.

Population pressure on natural resources is increasing. Over-population is
already straining the "carrying capacity" of the middle hill areas,
particularly the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in the depletion of forest cover
for crops, fuel, and fodder and contributing to erosion and flooding. Although
steep mountain terrain makes exploitation difficult, mineral surveys have
found small deposits of limestone, magnesite, zinc, copper, iron, mica, lead,
and cobalt. Coal mining is also done with 11522 tones produced in 2018 alone.

The development of hydroelectric power projects also cause some tension with
local indigenous groups, recently[_when?_] empowered by Nepal's ratification
of ILO Convention 169.
