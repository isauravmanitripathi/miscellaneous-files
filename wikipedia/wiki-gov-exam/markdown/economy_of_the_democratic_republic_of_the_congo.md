The **economy of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo** declined drastically in
the years leading up to and during the First and Second Congo Wars, despite
being home to vast potential in natural resources and mineral wealth; its
gross domestic product is $69.474 billion as of 2023. During the last five
reported years, the exports of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have
changed by $15.2B from $13.3B in 2017 to $28.5B in 2022. Since 2003, the DRC's
economy has gradually grown, but it remains one of the poorest countries in
the world.

At the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa. It
had a thriving mining sector, and its agriculture sector was relatively
productive. Since then, decades of corruption, war, and political instability
have been a severe detriment to further growth, today leaving DRC with a GDP
per capita and a HDI rating that rank among the world's lowest and make the
DRC one of the most fragile and, according to the United Nations, least
developed countries in the world.

Despite this, the DRC is quickly modernizing; it tied with Malaysia for the
largest positive change in HDI development in 2016. Government projects
include strengthening the health system for maternal and child health,
expansion of electricity access, water supply reconstructions, and urban and
social rehabilitation programs.

## Economic implications of conflicts

The two recent conflicts (the First and Second Congo Wars), which began in
1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have
increased external debt, and have resulted in the deaths of more than five
million people from war and associated famine and disease. Malnutrition
affects approximately two-thirds of the country's population.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of GDP in
1997. In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the workforce.

Rich in minerals, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a difficult history
of predatory mineral extraction, which has been at the heart of many struggles
within the country for many decades, but particularly in the 1990s. The
economy of the second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining.
However, much economic activity occurs in the informal sector and is not
reflected in GDP data.

In 2006, Transparency International ranked the Democratic Republic of the
Congo 156 out of 163 countries in the Corruption Perception Index, tying
Bangladesh, Chad, and Sudan with a 2.0 rating. President Joseph Kabila
established the Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension
to power in 2001.

The conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo were over water, minerals,
and other resources. Political agendas have worsened the economy, as in times
of crisis, the elite benefit while the general populace suffers. This is
worsened as a result of corrupt national and international corporations. The
corporations instigate and allow the fighting for resources because they
benefit from it. A large proportion of fatalities in the country are
attributed to a lack of basic services, recognized as "communicable, maternal,
perinatal, and nutritional conditions," which account for 56% of deaths by
broad cause. The influx of refugees since the war in 1998 only serves to
worsen the issue of poverty. Money of the taxpayers in the DRC is often
misappropriated by the corrupt leaders of the country, who use the money to
benefit themselves instead of the citizens of the DRC. The DRC is consistently
ranked among the lowest countries on the UN Human Development Index.

### After Leopold

Forced labor (slavery) was important for the rural sector. The corporations
that dominated the economy were mostly owned by Belgium, but British capital
also played an important role. The 1950s were a period of rising income and
expectations. Congo was said to have the best public health system in Africa,
but there was also a huge wealth disparity. Belgian companies favored workers
in certain areas more and exported them to work in different areas,
restricting opportunities for others. Favored groups also received better
education and were able to secure jobs for people in the same ethnic group,
which increased tensions. In 1960 there were only 16 university graduates out
of a population of 20 million. Belgium still had economic power, and
independence gave little opportunity for improvement. Common refrains included
"no elite, no trouble" and "before independence = after independence." When
the Belgians left, most of the government officials and educated residents
left with them. Before independence, there were just 3 out of 5000 government
jobs held by Congolese people. The resulting loss of institutional knowledge
and human capital crippled the government.

### Zaire

After the Congo Crisis, Mobutu arose as the country's sole ruler and
stabilized the country politically. Economically, however, the situation
continued to decline, and by 1979, the purchasing power was only 4% of that
from 1960. Starting in 1976, the IMF provided stabilizing loans to the
dictatorship. Much of the money was embezzled by Mobutu and his circle. This
was not a secret, as the 1982 report by IMF's envoy, Erwin Blumenthal,
documented. He stated, "It is alarmingly clear that the corruptive system in
Zaire, with all its wicked and ugly manifestations, its mismanagement and
fraud, will destroy all endeavors of international institutions, of friendly
governments, and of the commercial banks towards recovery and rehabilitation
of Zaire’s economy". Blumenthal indicated that there was "no chance" that
creditors would ever recover their loans. Yet the IMF and the World Bank
continued to lend money that was either embezzled, stolen, or "wasted on
_white elephant_ projects". "Structural adjustment programmes" implemented as
a condition of IMF loans cut support for health care, education, and
infrastructure.

### 1990s

Poor infrastructure, an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of
openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake
on investment and growth. In the early 1990s, a number of International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank missions met with the government to help it
develop a coherent economic plan, but without reform being implemented.

Faced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more
drastic measures and in January 1999 banned the widespread use of American
dollars for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later
adjusted. The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for
economic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its
expenditure. Growth was negative in 2000 because of the difficulty of meeting
the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports,
and post-coup instability.

### 2000s

DRC's economic growth decelerated from its pre-COVID level of 4.4% in 2019 to
an estimated 0.8% in 2020. Growth was driven by the extractives sector which,
helped by robust demand from China, expanded by 6.9% in 2020 (compared to 1%
in 2019). Meanwhile, non-mining sectors contracted by 1.6% (vs. growth of 5.7%
in 2019) due to pandemic-related mobility restrictions, weaker trading
activities and constrained government spending. Private consumption and
government investment fell in 2020 by an estimated 1.0% and 10.2%,
respectively.

#### Special economic zones

The DRC planned to establish special economic zones (SEZ) to encourage the
revival of its industry. The first SEZ was planned to come into being in 2012
in N'Sele, a commune of Kinshasa, and will focus on agro-industries. The
Congolese authorities also planned to open another zone dedicated to mining
(Katanga) and a third dedicated to cement (in the Bas-Congo). There are three
phases to the program that each have their own objectives. Phase I was the
precursor to the actual investment in the Special Economic Zone, where
policymakers agreed to the framework, the framework was studied for its
establishment, and to predict the potential market demand for the land. Stage
one of Phase II involved submitting laws for the Special Economic Zone,
finding good sites for businesses, and currently there is an effort to help
the government attract foreign investment. Stage two of Phase II hasn't been
started yet, and it involves assisting the government in creating a framework
for the country, creating an overall plan for the site, figuring out what the
environmental impact of the project will be, and guessing how much it will
cost and what the return can be made on the investment. Phase III involves the
World Bank creating a transaction phase that will keep everything competitive.
The program is looking for options to hand over the program to the World Bank,
which could be very beneficial for the western part of the country.

## Economic implications of instability

Ongoing conflicts dramatically reduced government revenue and increased
external debt. As Reyntjens wrote, "Entrepreneurs of insecurity are engaged in
extractive activities that would be impossible in a stable state environment.
The criminalization context in which these activities occur offers avenues for
considerable factional and personal enrichment through the trafficking of
arms, illegal drugs, toxic products, mineral resources and dirty
money."[_citation needed_] Ethnic rivalries were made worse because of
economic interests and looting and coltan smuggling took place. Illegal
monopolies formed in the country where they used forced labor for children to
mine or work as soldiers. National parks were overrun with people looking to
exploit minerals and resources. Increased poverty and hunger from the war
increased the hunting of rare wildlife. Education was denied when the country
was under foreign control, and very few people made money off the minerals in
the country. The national resources are not the root cause of the continued
fighting in the region; however, the competition has become an incentive to
keep fighting.[1] The DRC's level of economic freedom is one of the lowest in
the world, putting it in the repressed category. The armed militias fight with
the government in the eastern section of the country over the mining sector or
the corruption of the government, and weak policies lead to the instability of
the economy. Human rights abuses also ruin economic activity; the DRC has a 7%
unemployment rate but still has one of the lowest GDPs per capita in the
world. A major problem for people trying to start their own companies is that
the minimum amount of capital needed to launch the company is five times the
average annual income, and prices are regulated by the government, which
almost forces people to have to work for the larger, more corrupt businesses;
otherwise, they won't have work. It is hard for the DRC to encourage foreign
trade because of the regulatory barriers.

## International relations

Poor infrastructure, an uncertain legal framework, corruption, and lack of
openness in government economic policy and financial operations remain a brake
on investment and growth. A number of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank missions have met with the new government to help it develop a
coherent economic plan, but associated reforms are on hold.

Faced with continued currency depreciation, the government resorted to more
drastic measures and in January 1999 banned the widespread use of U.S. dollars
for all domestic commercial transactions, a position it later adjusted. The
government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for economic
transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its
expenditure. Growth was negative in 2000 because of the difficulty of meeting
the conditions of international donors, continued low prices of key exports,
and post-coup instability. 125 companies in 2003 contributed to the conflict
in DRC, showing the corruption.

### World Bank

With the help of the International Development Association the DRC has worked
toward the reestablishment of social services. This is done by giving 15
million people access to basic health services and giving bed nets to prevent
malaria from spreading to people. With the Emergency Demobilization and
Reintegration Program, more than 107,000 adults and 34,000 child soldiers
stood down their militarized posture. The travel time from Lubumbashi to
Kasomeno in Katanga went down from seven days to two hours because of the
improved roads, which led to the decrease of prices of main goods by 60%. With
the help of the IFC, KfW, and the EU, the DRC improved its businesses by
reducing the time it took to create a business by 51%, reducing the time it
took to get construction permits by 54%, and reducing the number of taxes from
118 to 30. Improvements in health have been noticeable, specifically that
deliveries attended by trained staff jumped from 47 to 80%. In education, 14
million textbooks were provided to children, completion rates of school have
increased, and higher education was made available to students that chose to
pursue it.

### International Monetary Fund

The IMF plans on giving the DRC a $1 billion loan after its two-year
suspension after it failed to give details about a mining deal from one of its
state-owned mines and an Israeli billionaire, Dan Gertler. The loan may be
necessary for the country because there will be elections in December 2016 for
the next president, and the cost of funding this would range around $1.1
billion. The biggest problem with the vote is getting a country of 68 million
people the size of Western Europe to polling stations with less than 1,860
miles of paved roads.

## Sectors

### Agriculture

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of the GDP in
1997. Main cash crops include coffee, palm oil, rubber, cotton, sugar, tea,
and cocoa. Food crops include cassava, plantains, maize, groundnuts, and rice.
In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the work force.

The Democratic Republic of Congo produced, in 2018:

  * 29.9 million tons of cassava (3rd largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria and Thailand);
  * 4.7 million tons of plantain (largest producer in the world);
  * 2 million tons of maize;
  * 1.1 million tons of palm oil;
  * 990 thousand tons of rice;
  * 384 thousand tons of sweet potato;
  * 309 thousand tons of banana;
  * 307 thousand tons of peanut;
  * 213 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
  * 213 thousand tons of papaya;
  * 205 thousand tons of beans;
  * 186 thousand tons of pineapple;
  * 168 thousand tons of orange;
  * 101 thousand tons of potato;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such as
coffee (29 thousand tons), cocoa (3.6 thousand tons), natural rubber (14
thousand tons) and tea (3.6 thousand tons).

### Fishing

The Democratic Republic of Congo also possesses 50 percent of Africa's forests
and a river system that could provide hydro-electric power to the entire
continent, according to a United Nations report on the country's strategic
significance and its potential role as an economic power in central Africa.
Fish are the single most important source of animal protein in the DRC. Total
production of marine, river, and lake fisheries in 2003 was estimated at
222,965 tons, all but 5,000 tons from inland waters. PEMARZA, a state agency,
carries on marine fishing.

### Forestry

Forests cover 60 percent of the total land area. There are vast timber
resources, and commercial development of the country's 61 million hectares
(150 million acres) of exploitable wooded area is only beginning. The Mayumbe
area of Bas-Congo was once the major center of timber exploitation, but
forests in this area were nearly depleted. The more extensive forest regions
of the central cuvette and of the Ubangi River valley have increasingly been
tapped.

Roundwood removals were estimated at 72,170,000 m2 in 2003, about 95 percent
for fuel. Some 14 species are presently being harvested. Exports of forest
products in 2003 totaled $25.7 million. Foreign capital is necessary in order
for forestry to expand, and the government recognizes that changes in tax
structure and export procedures will be needed to facilitate economic
growth.[_citation needed_]

### Mining

Rich in minerals, the DRC has a difficult history of predatory mineral
extraction, which has been at the heart of many struggles within the country
for many decades, but particularly in the 1990s. Although the economy of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the second largest country in Africa who has
historically relied heavily on mining, is no longer reflected in the GDP data
as the mining industry has suffered from a long-term "uncertain legal
framework, corruption, and a lack of transparency in government policy." The
informal sector.

In her book entitled _The Real Economy of Zaire_ , MacGaffey described a
second, often illegal economy, "system D," which is outside the official
economy (MacGaffey 1991:27). and therefore is not reflected in the GDP.

### Energy

Through its expansive river system, 86% of the electricity in the country is
hydroelectric. However, electricity is almost only available urban areas, and
even there less than half of the population is able to use it. As of 2022,
only 45% of the urban population, and 21.5% of the total population has access
to electricity. At over 70%, charcoal is primary cooking fuel in the country,
and almost the exclusive one in Kinshasa, wood and other biomass coming far
second at around 20%.

## Exploitation of mineral substances by companies

Geographical distribution of the global battery supply chain in 2024.

The economy of the second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining.
The Congo is the world's largest producer of cobalt ore, and a major producer
of copper and industrial diamonds. The Congo has more than 30% of the world's
diamond reserves., mostly in the form of small, industrial diamonds. The
coltan is a major source of tantalum, which is used in the fabrication of
electronic components in computers and mobile phones. In 2002, tin was
discovered in the east of the country, but, to date, mining has been done on a
small scale. Manono in Central DRC has a significant deposit of lithium and
tin with tantalum and niobium and is being developed by an Australian company.
Production is expected in 2023. According to a 2011 report, the total value of
the major mineral reserves in the DRC amounted to a total of over 300 billion
US dollars at the time.

Smuggling of the conflict minerals, coltan and cassiterite (ores of tantalum
and tin, respectively), has helped fuel the war in the Eastern Congo.

Today's larger mining companies are making changes and adhering to global
demand for ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) and IRMA (Initiative for
Responsible Mining Assurance). One such globally recognised certification is
the 3T iTSCi, the only widely implemented and accepted mineral traceability
and due diligence system in the region for the 3T minerals—tin, tantalum and
tungsten—an internationally recognised certification for responsible mining
and traceability under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Today, four central African
countries, including the DRC, provides legitimate and ethical 3T minerals.
ITSCI is the only industry initiative with standards 100% aligned with the
OECD Guidance. Much has been done in the last 15 years, providing artisanal
and small-scale miners a support network through iTSCi to build the
foundations and regulate the industry. At the end of 2019 ITSCI has seen to
2000 mines, employment of around 80,000 miners, and the supply of over 2000
tonnes of tin, tantalum and tungsten minerals per month; the initiative has
come a long way in the last decade. A report had been done by Pact in 2015,
detailing iTSCi's progress over the previous five years; it discusses the
successes, the challenges ahead and the work yet to be done. Entitled
_Unconflicted: Making Conflict-Free Mining a Reality in the DRC, Rwanda and
Burundi._

### Copper and cobalt

Katanga Mining Limited, a London-based company, owns the Luilu Metallurgical
Plant, which has a capacity of 175,000 tonnes of copper and 8,000 tonnes of
cobalt per year, making it the largest cobalt refinery in the world. After a
major rehabilitation program, the company restarted copper production in
December 2007 and cobalt production in May 2008.

### Informal sector

Much economic activity occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in
GDP data.

## Transport

Ground transport in the Democratic Republic of Congo has always been
difficult. The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers
to road and rail construction, and the distances are enormous across this vast
country. Furthermore, chronic economic mismanagement and internal conflict
have led to serious under-investment over many years.

On the other hand, the Democratic Republic of Congo has thousands of
kilometres of navigable waterways, and traditionally, water transport has been
the dominant means of moving around approximately two-thirds of the country.
