The **economy of Malta** is a highly industrialised service-based economy. It
is classified as an advanced economy by the International Monetary Fund and is
considered a high-income country by the World Bank and an innovation-driven
economy by the World Economic Forum. It is a member of the European Union and
of the eurozone, having formally adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.

The strengths of Malta's economy are its advantageous location, being situated
in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea at a crossroads between Europe, North
Africa and the Middle East, its fully developed open market economy,
multilingual population (88% of Maltese people speak English), productive
labour force, low corporate tax and well developed finance and ICT clusters.
The economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially
electronics), tourism and other services in the tertiary sector of the
economy. In 2014, over 1.7 million tourists visited the island.

Malta's GDP per capita in 2024, adjusted by purchasing power parity, stood at
$67,682 and ranked 15th in the list of EU countries in terms of purchasing
power standard. In the 2013 calendar year, Malta recorded a budget deficit of
2.7%, which is within the limits for eurozone countries imposed by the
Maastricht criteria, and Government gross debt of 69.8%. At 5.9%, Malta had
the sixth-lowest unemployment rate in the EU in 2015.

Malta is the 33rd-most democratic country in the world according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index.

## Transport

Aerial view of Luqa International Airport

Malta has an airport, Luqa International Airport, and two majors ports, Malta
Freeport and Valletta Cruise Port. Malta Freeport is used for all cargo ships
and imports-exports while Valletta Cruise Port is only used by cruise ships.
The Malta Freeport reported revenues of 170 million euros, while €90 million
came from the Valletta Cruise Port, totaling €260 million. The Freeport
connects Malta with 110 others ports in the world including 55 in the
Mediterranean. Furthermore, 2,189 container ships carried 2.80 million TEU of
container traffic in and out of Malta Freeport in 2022. The Valletta Cruise
Port welcomed 900,000 passengers in 2023, contributing €53 million to the
Maltese economy.

  
Luqa International Airport serves 35 different airlines with 115 destinations.
In 2023, 7.8 million people travelled through the airport, providing $2.7
billion in revenues to the Maltese economy, equivalent to 24% of Malta's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP). Specifically, the former air flag carrier of Malta Air
Malta, KM Malta Airlines since 2024, had a revenue of €679.4 million in 2022.
Another new airline operating from Luqa Airport, Universal Air, started
operations in April 2024 with a fleet of 6 aircraft. The airlines, airport,
and surrounding businesses employ almost 7,000 people.

## History

During the Napoleonic Wars (1800–1815), Malta's economy prospered and became
the focal point of a major trading system. In 1808, two-thirds of the cargo
consigned from Malta went to Levant and Egypt. Later, one half of the cargo
was usually destined for Trieste. Cargo consisted of largely British and
colonial-manufactured goods. Malta's economy became prosperous from this trade
and many artisans, such as weavers, found new jobs in the port industry.

In 1820, during the Battle of Navarino, which took place in Greece, the
British fleet was based in Malta. In 1839, P&O and East India Company used
Malta as a calling port on their Egypt and Levant runs.

In 1869, the opening of the Suez Canal benefited Malta's economy greatly as
there was a massive increase in the shipping which entered in the port. The
economy had entered a special phase. The Mediterranean Sea became the "world
highway of trade" and a number of ships called at Malta for coal and various
supplies on their way to the Indian Ocean and the Far East. From 1871 to 1881,
about 8,000 workers found jobs in the Malta docks and a number of banks opened
in Malta. By 1882, Malta reached the height of its prosperity.

However, the boom did not last long. By the end of the 19th century, the
economy began declining and by the 1940s, Malta's economy was in serious
crisis. This was primarily due to the invention of large ships which had
become oil-fired and therefore had no need to stop in the Grand Harbor of
Malta to refuel. The British Government had to extend the dockyard.

At the end of World War II, Malta's strategic importance had reached a low
point. Modern air warfare technology and the invention of the atomic bomb had
changed the importance of the military base. The British lost control of the
Suez Canal and withdrew from the naval dockyard, transforming it for
commercial shipbuilding and ship repair purposes.

## Modern economy

The Maltese economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing (especially
electronics and pharmaceuticals), and tourism. Malta adopted the Euro currency
on 1 January 2008.

Tourist arrivals and foreign exchange earnings derived from tourism have
steadily increased since 1987. Following the September 11 attacks, the tourist
industry suffered a temporary setback. With the help of a favorable
international economic climate, the availability of domestic resources, and
industrial policies that support foreign export-oriented investment, the
economy has been able to sustain a period of rapid growth.[_citation needed_]
Growing public and private sector demand for credit has led — in the context
of interest rate controls — to credit rationing to the private sector and the
introduction of non-interest charges by banks. Despite these pressures,
consumer price inflation has remained low (2.2% according to the Central Bank
of Malta in 2007), reflecting the impact of a fixed exchange rate policy (100%
hard peg to the euro, in preparation for currency changeover) and lingering
price controls.

There is a strong manufacturing base for high value-added products like
electronics and pharmaceuticals, and the manufacturing sector has more than
250 foreign-owned, export-oriented enterprises. Tourism generates around 15%
of GDP. Film production in Malta is another growing industry (approx. 35
million euros between 1997 and 2011), despite stiff competition from other
film locations in Eastern Europe and North Africa, with the Malta Film
Commission providing support services to foreign film companies for the
production of feature cinema, commercials and television series.

From 2001 to 2005 the mean GDP real growth was 0.4% due to Malta losing pace
in tourism and other industries. Unemployment was down to 4.4%, its lowest
level in 3 years. Many formerly state-owned companies are being privatised—and
the market liberalised.

Fiscal policy has been directed toward bringing down the budget deficit after
public debt grew from a negative figure in 1988 to 56% in 1999 and 69.1% in
2009. By 2007, the deficit-to-GDP ratio was comfortably below 3% as required
for eurozone membership, but due to pre-election spending has gone up to 4.4%
in 2008 and 3.8% in 2009.

Despite a great potential for solar and wind power, Malta produces almost all
its electricity from oil, importing 100% of it. Energy and the cost of energy,
which is oft-quoted as the highest in Europe, was a key issue in the 2013
election.

## Poverty

Poverty and social exclusion are significant problems in Malta. As of 2008, an
estimate of 15% of Malta's citizens were living below the poverty line, which
was slightly better than the EU average of 17% at the time. To address the
issue of poverty, on 24 December 2014 Malta addressed poverty in the six
branches of social services, health and environment, culture, income and
social benefits, education and employment, by unveiling the National Strategic
Policy for Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion; this will stay in effect
from 2014 to 2024. Under this policy, stakeholders will be involved in the
discussion of how to reduce hardships experienced by families living in Malta.

## Unemployment system

Benefits for unemployment are given out based on contributory and non-
contributory schemes. Contributory schemes distribute unemployment benefits
within 50 weeks of contribution. Non-contributory schemes a Social
Unemployment Benefit is granted after a means test to the head of a household.
In order to qualify for unemployment benefits, a person must be able to do
work and have registered as unemployed.

There are three categories to the Malta registrar of unemployment. People who
have never worked fall into category one. Those who quit or were dismissed
from their jobs fall into category two. Category three is for people who are
currently employed but are looking for other job prospects. Benefits for
unemployment are given for 156 days after which a person may qualify for the
means tested unemployment assistance. People eligible for unemployment
benefits are Maltese citizens who are aged sixteen years or older, people
signed up for eligible work-study programs, and citizens outside of Malta who
are employed by foreign entities.

Some scholars have noted that Malta's unemployment system has created a
dependency on the benefits provided by the system. From 1992 to 2005, there
was an increase in the number of recipients of both short-term and long-term
benefits. Additionally, in 2016, 969 Maltese citizens were cut off the
employment register for abusing the system. For these reasons, there has been
movements from politicians to reduce and reshape the unemployment system.
After the election of the Labour Party in 2013, the number of people receiving
unemployment benefits dropped by 75%. This same government introduced the "in-
work" benefit which forces more people to work while helping the most poor and
desperate.

In order to be eligible for in-work benefit, applicants must first have
children under the age of 23, and from that point, benefits vary depending on
marital status and the number of people employed per family. For a single
parent in employment who earns between €6,600-€16,500, they are eligible for a
maximum payable rate of up to €1,250 annually per child. For a married couple
whose collective income is between €10,000 and is less than €24,000 (the
income of one of the spouses must be over €3,000), they are eligible for a
maximum payment rate of up to €1,200 annually per child. In 2016, the in-work
benefit was extended to married couples where only one parent works, extending
the benefit to an additional 3,700 families. For a married couple with only
one parent gainfully employed whose income is greater than €6,600 and less
than €16,500, they are eligible for a maximum payable rate of up to €350
yearly per child. The in-work benefit is paid quarterly in January, April,
July, and October.

At 42.3% in 2017, female workforce participation rate in Malta is relatively
low. For over half of Maltese women who stay out of the workforce altogether,
they do not receive direct unemployment benefits. Rather, most unemployment
benefits are given to men because to receive unemployment benefits, one must
first be employed. However, because older women tend to stay out of the
workforce, those women who do participate in the workforce tend to be younger
and have higher levels of education. This has led to a lower long-term
unemployment rate amongst women than men. In 2011, the long-term unemployment
rate of women was 2.5% while the long-term unemployment rate of men was 3.3%.

## Pensions system

Malta has public and private pension systems. There are two types of
contributions for the public pension system: class one and class two. Employed
people contribute to class one and those are self-employed contribute to class
two. There was a gradual increase in pension age in Malta in the 1950s and
1960s; for example, someone who was born in 1953 needs to be 62 years old in
order to collect pensions while another person born in 1960 would have to be
64 years old in order to collect pensions. Another requirement to qualify for
a Malta pension program is that a person must have been contributing to the
program for a certain time period or they will not be eligible..In Malta there
is a state Malta Retirement Programme for foreign pensioners. According to the
programme, a foreigner whose income is more than 75% from pension payments,
can receive a residence permit in the country and a special tax status.
