The economy of Tunisia is in the process of being liberalized after decades of
heavy state direction and participation in the country's economy. Prudent
economic and fiscal planning has resulted in moderate but sustained growth for
over a decade. Tunisia's economic growth historically has depended on oil,
phosphates, agri-food products, car parts manufacturing, and tourism. In the
World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report for 2015–2016, Tunisia
ranks in 92nd place.

The year 2015 was marked by terrorist attacks in Tunisia which are likely to
affect economic growth, especially in tourism, one of the main sectors.

## Historical trend

GDP per capita soared by more than 380% in the seventies (1970–1980: USD
280–1,369). But this proved unsustainable and it collapsed to a cumulative 10%
growth in the turbulent eighties (1980–1990: USD 1,369–1,507), rising again to
almost 50% cumulative growth in the nineties (1990–2000: USD 1,507–2,245),
signifying the impact of successful diversification.

Growing foreign debt and the foreign exchange crisis in the mid-1980s led the
government to launch a structural adjustment program to liberalize prices,
reduce tariffs, and reorient Tunisia toward a market economy in 1986.
Tunisia's economic reform program was lauded as a model by international
financial institutions. The government liberalized prices, reduced tariffs,
lowered debt-service-to-exports and debt-to-GDP ratios, and extended the
average maturity of its $10 billion foreign debt. Structural adjustment
brought additional lending from the World Bank and other Western creditors. In
1990, Tunisia acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and
is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

In 1996 Tunisia entered into an "Association Agreement" with the European
Union (EU) which removed tariffs and other trade barriers on most goods by
2008. In conjunction with the Association Agreement, the EU is assisting the
Tunisian government's _Mise A Niveau_ (upgrading) program to enhance the
productivity of Tunisian businesses and prepare for competition in the global
marketplace.

The government totally or partially privatized around 160 state-owned
enterprises after the privatization program was launched in 1987. Although the
program is supported by the GATT, the government had to move carefully to
avoid mass firings. Unemployment continued to plague Tunisia's economy and was
aggravated by a rapidly growing workforce. An estimated 55% of the population
is under the age of 25. Officially, 15.2% of the Tunisian workforce is
unemployed.

In 2011, after the Arab Spring, the economy slumped but then recovered with
2.81% GDP growth in 2014. However, unemployment is still one of the major
issues with 15.2% of the labor force unemployed as of the first quarter of
2014. Tunisia's political transition gained new momentum in early 2014, with
the resolution of a political deadlock, the adoption of a new Constitution and
the appointment of a new government. The national dialogue platform, brokered
by key civil society organizations, played a crucial role in gathering all
major political parties. This consensus will allow for further reform in the
economy and public sector.

In 2015, the Bardo National Museum attack led to the collapse of the third
largest sector of Tunisia's economy; tourism. Tunisian tourist workers in
Tunis have said that "tourism is dead, it is completely dead", expressing the
severe drop in tourism after the attack.

The number of ragpickers in Tunisia is increasing due to the continuing high
level of unemployment, the loss of purchasing power of the most disadvantaged
families, and the explosion of plastic waste due to new consumption habits.
Ragpickers do not benefit from social protection, granted to professions with
a legal status and may be subject to the exploitation of the Recycling
industry.

## External trade and investment

Tunisian exports in 2006

In 1992, Tunisia re-entered the private international capital market for the
first time in 6 years, securing a $10-million line of credit for balance-of-
payments support. In January 2003 Standard & Poor's affirmed its investment
grade credit ratings for Tunisia. The World Economic Forum 2002-03 ranked
Tunisia 34th in the Global Competitiveness Index Ratings (two places behind
South Africa, the continent's leader). In April 2002, Tunisia's first US
dollar-denominated sovereign bond issue since 1997 raised $458 million, with
maturity in 2012.

The Bourse de Tunis is under the control of the state-run Financial Market
Council and lists over 50 companies. The government offers substantial tax
incentives to encourage companies to join the exchange, and expansion is
occurring.

The Tunisian government adopted a unified investment code in 1993 to attract
foreign capital. More than 1,600 export-oriented joint venture firms operate
in Tunisia to take advantage of relatively low labor costs and preferential
access to nearby European markets. Economic links are closest with European
countries, which dominate Tunisia's trade. Tunisia's currency, the dinar, is
not traded outside Tunisia. However, partial convertibility exists for bona
fide commercial and investment transaction. Certain restrictions still limit
operations carried out by Tunisian residents.

The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Tunisia was valued at
$5.3 Billion in 2007, 15% of 2007 GDP, by the World Bank.

For 2007, foreign direct investment totaled TN Dinar 2 billion in 2007, or
5.18% of the total volume of investment in the country. This figure is up
35.7% from 2006 and includes 271 new foreign enterprises and the expansion of
222 others already based in the country.

The economic growth rate seen for 2007, at 6.3% is the highest achieved in a
decade.

On 29 and 30 November, Tunisia held an investment conference with country
chiefs from all around the world with pledges that have reached $30 billion to
finance new public projects.

As of 2022, Tunisia's government is in need of international help as the
economy grapples with a crisis in public finances that has raised fears it may
default on debt and has contributed to shortages of food and fuel, according
to government critics. As a result, the government announced in December 2022
that they expect to reduce its fiscal deficit to 5.5% in 2023 from a forecast
7.7% this year, driven by austerity measures that could pave the way for a
final deal with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. In 2025,
Tunisia severed ties with the IMF.

### Loan guarantee

Source:

On 20 April 2012, U.S. Treasury Secretary and Tunisian Finance Minister
Houcine Dimassi signed a declaration of intent to move forward on a U.S. loan
guarantee for Tunisia. The U.S. Government would provide this loan guarantee
to enable the Tunisian government to access significant market financing at
affordable rates and favorable maturities with the backing of a U.S. guarantee
of principal and interest (up to 100 percent).

The support would consist of the U.S. guarantee of Tunisian government-issued
debt (or of bank loans made to the Government of Tunisia). This guarantee will
significantly reduce the Tunisian government's borrowing costs at a time when
market access has become more expensive for many emerging market countries. In
the weeks ahead, both governments intend to make progress on a loan guarantee
agreement that would allow Tunisia to move forward with a debt issuance.

The ceremony took place at the World Bank immediately following the meeting of
Finance Ministers of the Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in
Transition.

Microfinance institutions, such as Enda Tamweel, exist to assist those who are
unable to access the regular banking system. This comprises those living in
rural or impoverished regions where the informal sector thrives, accounting
for 34% of Tunisia's GDP.

Enda Tamweel has made over 3 million microloans to over 900,000 people in the
30 years since its inception, infusing more than €1.6 billion into the local
economy.

## Energy

Tunisia's natural resources are modest when compared to those of its
neighbors: Algeria and Libya. This modesty in natural resources forced the
country to import oil, which contributed to the rise in the cost of gasoline:
on 26 April 2006, the liter crossed the bar of one dinar to sell for 1.50
Tunisian dinars. (a price equivalent to European prices from the point of view
of purchasing power parity).
