The **economy of Lesotho** is based on tourism, manufacturing, mining, and
agriculture, and depends heavily on remittances from its diaspora. Lesotho, a
lower middle income country, is geographically surrounded by South Africa and
is economically integrated with it as well. A significant portion of the
population subsists on farming with a gradual ongoing transition into tourism
and manufacturing.

Lesotho is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) in which
tariffs have been eliminated on the trade of goods between the other member
countries, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Eswatini. Lesotho, Eswatini,
Namibia, and South Africa also form a common currency and exchange control
area known as the Rand Monetary Area that uses the South African rand as the
common currency. In 1980, Lesotho introduced its own currency, the loti
(plural: _maloti_). One hundred **lisente** equal one loti. The loti is at par
with the rand.

## Economic history

Lesotho's early economic history was shaped by its integration into the
regional economy of Southern Africa, a heavy reliance on labor migration and
productivity in agriculture. In the 19th century, Lesotho was a significant
agricultural exporter, supplying grain and mohair to South African mining
camps. However, by the early 20th century, worsening land shortages and
unfavorable climate conditions shifted Lesotho into a net food importer and a
labor reserve for South African mines and farms. Labor migration became a
central economic pillar, with tens of thousands of Basotho men seeking
employment in South Africa throughout the 20th century. By 1982, over 100,000
Basotho were working in South African industries.

Lesotho's independence on the 4th of October 1966 marked the beginning of
increased international aid flows, with Britain, Sweden, and multilateral
donors providing financial assistance. And early aid efforts were largely
directed at agriculture, based on the assumption that Lesotho was a purely
agrarian society. Large-scale rural development projects, including those
funded by the World Bank and USAID, repeatedly failed due to, among other
reasons, poor planning and a lack of local participation.

Political instability influenced aid patterns. Following a 1970 coup, British
and Swedish aid was temporarily suspended but resumed later that year. Lesotho
also leveraged its opposition to apartheid to attract more aid, particularly
after the 1976 Soweto Uprising and Transkei border conflicts. By 1979,
development assistance had risen to $64 million.

Until the political insecurity in September 1998, Lesotho's economy had grown
steadily since 1992. The riots, however, destroyed nearly 80% of commercial
infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns in the country, having a
disastrous effect on the country's economy. Nonetheless, the country has
completed several IMF Structural Adjustment Programs, and inflation declined
substantially over the course of the 1990s. Lesotho's trade deficit, however,
is quite large, with exports representing only a small fraction of imports.

The global economic crisis hit the Lesotho economy hard through loss of
textile exports and jobs in the sector due largely to the economic slowdown in
the United States which is a major export destination, reduced diamond mining
and exports, including weak prices for diamonds; drop in SACU revenues due to
the economic slowdown in the South African economy, and reduction in worker
remittances due to weakening of the South African economy and contraction of
the mining sector and related job losses in South Africa. In 2009, GDP growth
slowed to 0.9 percent.

## Economic progress

Lesotho's progress in moving from a predominantly subsistence-oriented economy
to a lower middle income, diversified economy exporting natural resources and
manufacturing goods has brought higher, more secure incomes to a significant
portion of the population. The percentage of the population living below USD
PPP US$1.25/day fell from 48 percent to 44 percent between 1995 and 2003. The
unemployment rate in 2008 was 25.29% and rose to 27.2% in 2012. However, the
unemployment rate fell to 23.06% in 2017. The percentage of the population
living below the poverty line fell from 58% in 2002 to 49.2% in 2017. The
country is still among the "Low Human Development" countries (rank 155 of 192)
as classified by the UNDP, with 42.3 years of life expectancy at birth.
However, adult literacy is very high, at 82%, and children underweight aged
under 5 are only 20%.

Lesotho has received economic aid from a variety of sources, including the
United States, the World Bank, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and
Germany.

Lesotho has nearly 6,000 kilometers of unpaved and modern all-weather roads.
There is a short rail line (freight) linking Lesotho with South Africa that is
totally owned and operated by South Africa.

## Sectors

### Apparel

Lesotho has taken advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)
to become the largest exporter of garments to the US from sub-Saharan Africa.
American Brands and retailers sourcing from Lesotho include: Foot Locker, Gap,
Gloria Vanderbilt, JCPenney, Levi Strauss, Saks, Sears, Timberland and Wal-
Mart. In mid-2004 its employment reached over 50,000 mainly female workers,
marking the first time that manufacturing sector workers outnumbered
government employees. In 2008 it exported 487 million dollars mainly to the
United States. Since 2004 employment in the sector was somehow reduced to
about 45,000, in mid-2011, due to intense international competition in the
garment sector. It was the largest formal sector employer in Lesotho in 2011.
The sector initiated a major program to fight HIV/AIDS, called Apparel Lesotho
Alliance to Fight AIDS (ALAFA). It is an industry-wide program providing
prevention and treatment for the workers.

### Husbandry

High-mountain shepherds

The western lowlands form the main agricultural zone. Almost 50% of the
population earn income through informal crop cultivation or animal husbandry
with nearly two-thirds of the country's income coming from the agricultural
sector. About 70% of the population lives in rural areas and works in
agriculture.

## Women in the economy

While women are more subject to access to secondary schooling than men, men
make 1.5 times more income than women. Prior to the 1950s, Basotho women
migrated to South Africa for work due to an agricultural decline. Of those who
migrated, many of them were unwed and many stayed in South Africa. Married
couples also traveled to South Africa together for work. In 1923, the pass law
Natives (Urban Areas) Act was passed in South Africa which required black men
to carry passports with them at all times when in white areas for work. Women
were included in an amendment to the law in 1952. The amendment caused a
decline in migration of female labor, and by the 1970s, only 36.1% of women
over age 39 in Lesotho had worked in South Africa. Lesotho women did not work
in mines.

In the 1980s, Lesotho received aid to help with the manufacturing industry.
The main workers employed in the industry were young women. In 1990, 92% of
employees in the textile industry were women.

About 86% of the female population in Lesotho works in the textile industry.

## Natural resources

Water and diamonds are Lesotho's only significant natural resources. Water is
being extracted through the 30-year, multibillion-dollar Lesotho Highlands
Water Project (LHWP), which was initiated in 1986. The LHWP is designed to
capture, store, and transfer water from the Orange River system and send it to
South Africa's Free State and greater Johannesburg area, which features a
large concentration of South African industry, population and agriculture. At
the completion of the project, Lesotho should be almost completely self-
sufficient in the production of electricity and also gain income from the sale
of electricity to South Africa. The World Bank, African Development Bank,
European Investment Bank, and many other bilateral donors are financing the
project. Diamonds are produced in Letšeng, Mothae, Liqhobong and Kao mines.
The sector suffered a setback in 2008 as the result of the world recession but
rebounded in 2010 and 2011. It is a major contributor to the exports of
Lesotho.
