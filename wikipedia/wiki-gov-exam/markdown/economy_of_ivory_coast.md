The **economy of Ivory Coast** is stable and currently growing, in the
aftermath of political instability in recent decades. The Ivory Coast's
economy is largely market-based and depends heavily on the agricultural
sector. Almost 70% of the Ivorian people are engaged in some form of
agricultural activity. The economy grew 82% in the 1960s, reaching a peak
growth of 360% in the 1970s, but this proved unsustainable and it shrank by
28% in the 1980s and a further 22% in the 1990s. This decline, coupled with
high population growth, resulted in a steady fall in living standards. The
gross national product per capita, now rising again, was about US$727 in 1996.
It was substantially higher two decades before. Real GDP growth is expected to
average 6.5% in 2024–25.

After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a
comeback in 1994, due to the devaluation of the CFA franc and improved prices
for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional primary exports such as
pineapples and rubber, limited trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil
and gas discoveries, and generous external financing and debt rescheduling by
multilateral lenders and France. The 50% devaluation of franc zone currencies
on 12 January 1994 caused a one-time jump in the inflation rate to 26% in
1994, but the rate fell sharply from 1996–1999. Moreover, government adherence
to donor-mandated reforms led to a jump in growth to 5% annually in 1996–99. A
majority of the population remains dependent on smallholder cash crop
production.

## Infrastructure

By developing-country standards, Ivory Coast has an outstanding
infrastructure. There is a network of more than 13,000 kilometres (8,000 mi)
of paved roads; modern telecommunications services, including a public data
communications network; cellular phones and Internet access; two active ports,
one of which, Abidjan, is the most modern in West Africa; rail links-in the
process of being upgraded-both within the country and to Burkina Faso; regular
air service within the region and to and from Europe; and real estate
developments for commercial, industrial, retail, and residential use. Ivory
Coast's location and connections to neighboring countries makes it a preferred
platform for foreigners to conduct West African business operations. The city
of Abidjan is one of the most modern and liveable cities in the region.

The government's public investment plan accords priority to investment in
human capital, and to provide for significant spending on the economic
infrastructure needed to sustain growth.

In the new environment of government disengagement from productive activities
and in the wake of recent privatizations, anticipated investments in the
petroleum, electricity, water, and telecommunications sectors, and in part of
the transport sector, will be financed without any direct government
intervention.

Mean wages were $1.05 per man-hour in 2009.

## Agriculture

Ivory Coast produced, in 2018:

  * 7.2 million tonnes of yam (3rd largest producer in the world, only behind Nigeria and Ghana)
  * 5 million tons of cassava (14th largest producer in the world)
  * 2.1 million tons of palm oil
  * 2.1 million tons of rice
  * 1.9 million tons of cocoa (largest producer in the world)
  * 1.9 million tons of sugar cane
  * 1.8 million tons of plantain (8th largest producer in the world)
  * 1 million tons of maize
  * 688 thousand tons of cashew nuts (3rd largest producer in the world, behind Vietnam and India)
  * 461 thousand tons of natural rubber
  * 397 thousand tons of banana
  * 316 thousand tons of cotton

This is in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products,
like coffee (88 thousand tons) and pineapple (50 thousand tons).

Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers and exporters of cocoa
beans and palm oil. Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to
fluctuations in international prices for these products and to weather
conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify the economy, it is
still largely dependent on agriculture and related activities. Forced labor by
children bought and sold as slaves are endemic in cacao production.

## Energy

Côte d'Ivoire's energy supply relies on several hydroelectric stations and
gas-to-power plants that make use of the country's hydraulic and natural gas
resources. Over recent years, the country has also sought to develop its solar
industry and is setting up several solar PV plants to diversify its energy
mix.

Côte d'Ivoire also holds oil and natural gas resources offshore, though
production has remained small compared to other African neighbours such as
Ghana or Nigeria. For example, in 2021, it only produced about 25,000 barrels
of oil per day.

Since 2021, the Italian energy company Eni has made multiple oil and gas
discoveries in the offshore Baleine Field and begun their development. In
December 2024, its production facilities there entered their second phase,
generating 70m cubic feet of gas and 60,000 barrels of oil per day.

## Mining

In 2019, the country was the 9th largest world producer of manganese.

In the production of gold, in 2017 the country produced 20.3 tons.

## Rubber

Ivory Coast has emerged as a significant player in the global rubber market.
In 2022, the nation produced 1.55 million tonnes of natural rubber, surpassing
Vietnam to become the world's third-largest producer. This significant
increase from 815,000 tonnes in 2019 can be attributed to several factors,
including a shift by Ivorian farmers from cacao to rubber cultivation. This
shift is driven by the potential benefits of European sustainability
regulations, which will take effect in 2025.

## Tourism

Hotel Ivoire in Abidjan includes a casino.

Ivory Coast has made progress in diversifying its economy, and since the
1970s, has steadily expanded the facilities offered to tourists. Resort
lodgings in coastal areas have been developed. There are numerous hotels in
Abidjan, including international chains such as Novotel and Sofitel.

## External trade and investment

Ivoirian exports in 2006

Foreign direct investment (FDI) plays a key role in the Ivorian economy,
accounting for between 40% and 45% of total capital in Ivorian firms. France
is overwhelmingly the most important foreign investor. In recent
years[_when?_], French investment has accounted for about one-quarter of the
total capital in Ivorian enterprises, and between 55% and 60% of the total
stock of foreign investment capital.

The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Ivory Coast was $2,327
million in 2005 by the World Bank.

In March 2025, Côte d'Ivoire was scheduled to carry out its first bond issue
in CFA Francs on the international market.
