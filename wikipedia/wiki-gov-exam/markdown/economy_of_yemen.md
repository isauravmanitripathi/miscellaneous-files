The **economy of Yemen** is weak and underdeveloped, even more so since the
breakout of the Yemeni Civil War which led to instability and a growing
humanitarian crisis. At the time of unification, South Yemen and North Yemen
had different but equally struggling underdeveloped economic systems. Since
unification, the economy was further harmed by Yemen's support for Iraq during
the 1990–91 Persian Gulf War: Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni
workers, and both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait significantly reduced economic aid
to Yemen. The 1994 civil war further drained Yemen's economy. As a
consequence, Yemen has relied heavily on aid from multilateral agencies to
sustain its economy. In return, it pledged to implement significant economic
reforms. In 1997 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved two programs
to increase Yemen's credit significantly: the enhanced structural adjustment
facility (now known as the poverty reduction and growth facility, or PRGF) and
the extended funding facility (EFF). In the ensuing years, Yemen's government
attempted to implement recommended reforms: reducing the civil service
payroll, eliminating diesel and other subsidies, lowering defense spending,
introducing a general sales tax, and privatizing state-run industries.
However, limited progress led the IMF to suspend funding between 1999 and
2001.

In late 2005, the World Bank (which extended Yemen a four-year US$2.3 billion
economic support package in October 2002, together with other bilateral and
multilateral lenders) announced that, as a consequence of Yemen's failure to
implement significant reforms, the World Bank would reduce financial aid by
one-third over the period July 2005 through July 2008. A key component of the
$2.3 billion package — $300 million in concessional financing — was withheld,
pending the renewal of Yemen's PRGF with the IMF, which was under negotiation.
However, in May 2006 the World Bank adopted an assistance strategy for Yemen
providing for $400 million in International Development Association (IDA)
credits in 2006-2009. In November 2006, at a meeting of Yemen's development
partners, a total of $4.7 billion in grants and concessional loans was pledged
for the period 2007–2010. Despite possessing significant oil and gas resources
and a considerable amount of agriculturally productive land, Yemen remains one
of the poorest of the world's low-income countries. In 2018, more than 80
percent (2018) of the population lived in poverty. The influx of an average
1,000 Somali refugees per month into Yemen looking for work was an added drain
on the economy, which already coped with a 20 to 40 percent rate of
unemployment. Yemen remained under significant pressure to implement economic
reforms, lest it face the loss of badly needed international financial
support.

In the north, disruptions of the civil war (1962–1970) and frequent periods of
drought dealt severe blows to a previously prosperous agricultural sector.
Coffee production, formerly the north's main export and principal form of
foreign exchange, declined as the cultivation of khat increased. Low domestic
industrial output and a lack of raw materials made the Yemeni Arab Republic
dependent on a wide variety of imports.

The Yemeni Civil War and air bombing campaign by the coalition during the
Saudi-led intervention devastated the Yemeni economy further.

As a result of civil war, Yemen suffered from inflation and devaluation of the
Yemeni rial, and Yemen's economy contracted by 50% from the start of the civil
war on 19 March 2015 to October 2018.

## Macro-economic trend

Historical GDP per capita development

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Yemen (since
unification) at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund
with figures in millions of Yemeni Rials.

Year | Gross domestic product | US dollar exchange | Inflation index (2000=100)   
---|---|---|---  
1989 | 125,562 | 11.70 Yemeni Rials | 5.10   
1995 | 516,643 | 40.49 Yemeni Rials | 51   
2000 | 1,539,386 | 161.00 Yemeni Rials | 100   
2005 | 2,907,636 | 191.37 Yemeni Rials | 175   
  
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar exchanged at 150.11
Yemeni Rials and mean wages were $1.06 per man-hour in 2009.

Remittances from Yemenis working abroad and foreign aid paid for perennial
trade deficits. Substantial Yemeni communities exist in the Arabian Peninsula,
Indonesia, India, East Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Beginning in the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China
provided large-scale assistance to the YAR. This aid included funding of
substantial construction projects, scholarships, and considerable military
assistance.

## Integration issues

In the south, pre-independence economic activity was overwhelmingly
concentrated in the port city of Aden. The seaborne transit trade, upon which
the port relied, collapsed with the closure of the Suez Canal and Britain's
withdrawal from Aden in 1967. Only extensive Soviet aid, remittances from
south Yemenis working abroad, and revenues from the Aden refinery (built in
the 1950s) kept the PDRY's centrally planned Marxist economy afloat. With the
dissolution of the Soviet Union and a cessation of Soviet aid, the south's
economy effectively collapsed.

Since unification, the government has worked to integrate two relatively
disparate economic systems. However, severe shocks — including the return of
approximately 850,000 Yemenis in 1990 from the Persian Gulf states, a
subsequent major reduction of aid flows, and internal political disputes
culminating in the 1994 civil war — hampered economic growth.

## Industries

### Agriculture and fishing

Agriculture is the mainstay of Yemen's economy, generating more than 20
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) since 1990 (20.4 percent in 2005
according to the Central Bank of Yemen). Agriculture employs more than half
(54.2 percent in 2003) of the working Yemeni population. However, a U.S.
government estimate suggests that the sector accounted for only 13.5 percent
of GDP in 2005. Numerous environmental problems hamper growth in this sector —
soil erosion, sand dune encroachment, and deforestation — but the greatest
problem by far is the scarcity of water. As a result of low levels of
rainfall, agriculture in Yemen relies heavily on the extraction of
groundwater, a resource that is being depleted. Yemen's water tables are
falling by approximately two meters per year; it is estimated that Sanaa's
groundwater supplies could be exhausted by 2030. The use of irrigation has
made fruit and vegetables Yemen's primary cash crops. With the rise in the
output of irrigated crops, the production of traditional rain-fed crops such
as cereals has declined. According to the Central Bank of Yemen, the
production of khat, a mildly narcotic and heavily cultivated plant that
produces natural stimulants when its leaves are chewed, rose 6.7 percent in
2005 and accounted for 5.8 percent of GDP; the consumption of khat is
widespread in Yemen. According to the World Bank and other economists,
cultivation of this plant plays a dominant role in Yemen's agricultural
economy, constituting 10 percent of GDP and employing an estimated 150,000
persons while consuming an estimated 30 percent of irrigation water and
displacing land areas that could otherwise be used for exportable coffee,
fruits, and vegetables.

Although Yemen's extensive territorial waters and marine resources have the
potential to produce 840,000 tons of fish each year, its fishing industry is
relatively underdeveloped and consists largely of individual fishermen in
small boats. After the government lifted restrictions on fish exports,
production reached one-quarter of capacity, yielding revenues valued at US$260
million in 2005. Fish and fish products constituted only 1.7 percent of
Yemen's GDP but were the second largest export. In December 2005, the World
Bank approved a US$25 million credit for a Fisheries Management and
Conservation Project in all coastal governorates along the Red Sea and the
Gulf of Aden. This project was expected to improve fish landing and auction
facilities; provide ice plants for fish preservation; and enable Yemen's
Ministry of Fisheries to undertake more effective research, resource
management planning, and regulatory activities.

### Oil and gas

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to
reflect recent events or newly available information. _( February 2019)_  
---|---  
  
Yemen is an oil producer and has significant untapped offshore oil and gas
deposits. Unlike many regional oil producers, Yemen relies heavily on foreign
oil companies that have production-sharing agreements with the government.
Income from oil production constitutes 70 to 75 percent of government revenue
and about 90 percent of exports. Yemen contains proven crude oil reserves of
more than 9 billion barrels (1.4×109 m3), although that is falling from the
country's older fields, which have been wrecked by war and corruption, both
driven by the fact that oil provides around 90% of the country's exports. The
World Bank predicted that Yemen's oil and gas revenues would plummet during
2009 and 2010, and fall to zero by 2017 as supplies ran out; the UK's Royal
Institute for International Affairs warned that instability in Yemen could
expand a zone of lawlessness from northern Kenya to Saudi Arabia, while
describing Yemen's democracy as "fragile" and pointing to armed conflicts with
Islamists and tribal insurgents as causes of instability. As a result, Western
entities and other diplomats and leaders have an interest in maintaining
Yemen's stability averting adverse outcomes. According to statistics published
by the Energy Information Administration, crude oil output averaged 413,300
barrels per day (65,710 m3/d) in 2005, a reduction from 423,700 bbl/d (67,360
m3/d) in 2004. For the first eight months of 2006, crude oil output was flat,
averaging 412,500 bbl/d (65,580 m3/d).

Following a minor discovery in 1982 in the south, an American company found an
oil basin near Ma'rib in 1984. A total of 27,000 cubic metres per day (170,000
barrels per day) were produced there in 1995. A small oil refinery began
operations near Ma'rib in 1986. A Soviet discovery in the southern governorate
of Shabwah has proven only marginally successful even when taken over by a
different group. A Western consortium began exporting oil from Masila in the
Hadhramaut in 1993, and production there reached 67,000 m3/d (420,000 bbl/d)
in 1999. There are new finds in the Jannah (formerly known as the Joint Oil
Exploration Area) and east Shabwah blocks. Yemen's oil exports in 1995 earned
about US$1 billion. Yemen's offshore oil and gas deposits are estimated to
contain billions of barrels of oil and gas. Marib oil contains associated
natural gas. In September 1995, the Yemeni Government signed an agreement that
designated TotalEnergies of France to be the lead company for a project for
the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1997, Yemen Gas Company joined
with various privately held companies to establish Yemen LNG (YLNG). In August
2005, the government gave final approval to three LNG supply agreements,
enabling YLNG to award a $2 billion contract to an international consortium to
build the country's first liquefaction plant at Balhat on the Arabian Sea
coast. The project is a $3.7 billion investment over 25 years, producing
approximately 6.7 million tons of LNG annually, with shipments likely to go to
the United States and South Korea. Production of LNG began in October 2009.
The Yemen government expects the LNG project to add $350 million to its budget
and enable it to develop a petrochemicals industry.

### Industry and manufacturing

The US government estimates that Yemen's industrial sector constitutes 47.2
percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Together with services, construction,
and commerce, industry accounts for less than 25 percent of the labor force.
The largest contributor to the manufacturing sector's output is oil refining,
which generates roughly 40 percent of total revenue. The remainder of this
sector consists of the production of consumer goods and construction
materials. Manufacturing constituted approximately 9.5 percent of Yemen's GDP
in 2005. In 2000 Yemen had almost 34,000 industrial establishments with a
total of nearly 115,000 workers; the majority of the establishments were small
businesses (one to four employees). Almost half of all industrial
establishments are involved in processing food products and beverages; the
production of flour and cooking oil has increased in recent years.
Approximately 10 percent of the establishments are classified as manufacturing
mixed metal products, such as water-storage tanks, doors, and windows.

### Services and tourism

Economists have reported that Yemen's services sector constituted 51.7 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 and 52.2 percent of GDP in 2003. The
US government estimated that the services sector accounted for 39.7 percent of
GDP in 2004 and 39.3 percent in 2005.

Yemen's tourism industry is hampered by both limited infrastructure and
significant security concerns. The country's hotels and restaurants are below
international standards, and air and road transportation is largely
inadequate. Kidnappings of foreign tourists remain a threat, especially
outside the main cities. Coupled with terrorist bombings at the Port of Aden
in 2000 and 2002, the threat of kidnappings presents a significant deterrent
to tourism. In September 2006, tribesmen in the Shabwa province, east of
Sanaa, kidnapped four French tourists on their way to Aden; the tourists were
freed two weeks later. In October 2006, the U.S. Department of State
reiterated warnings to U.S. citizens, strongly urging them to carefully
consider the risks of traveling to Yemen. Britain's Foreign Office issued a
similar advisory. However, the number of tourist arrivals rose to 274,000 in
2004 from 155,000 in 2003.

## Labor

According to the US government, the agriculture and herding sector employs the
majority of Yemen's working population (54.2 percent in 2003). Industry,
services, construction, and commerce collectively account for less than 25
percent of the labor force.

According to the World Bank, Yemen's civil service is characterized by a
large, poorly paid work force and inadequate salary differential between high
and low skilled jobs to attract and retain qualified workers. In 2004, the
government increased civil service salaries by 20 to 40 percent in order to
alleviate the impact of anticipated economic reforms that were never
implemented. The result was a 20 percent rise in wage costs; civil service
wages constituted 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004. The 2005
budget reduced economic subsidies, but in exchange the new budget required the
government to make various concessions, including increasing civil service
wages another 10 to 15 percent by 2007 as part of a national wage strategy.

The economic assistance package that the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
pledged to Yemen is contingent on the implementation of civil service reform,
which the government has resisted because of the country's estimated 20 to 40
percent unemployment rate. In 2004, the government claimed to have reduced the
civil service labor force through retirements and layoffs, but it appears that
the large salary increases have lessened the impact of any reforms. The IMF
has stated that civil service salaries as a component of GDP should be reduced
by 1 to 2 percent, a level that can only be achieved with continued reductions
in the size of the civil service. It is unclear whether the national wage
strategy, which may succeed in streamlining the system and removing
irregularities, will in fact be able to reduce employment costs.

## Currency, exchange rate, and inflation

Yemen's currency is the Yemeni riyal (YR), which was floated on the open
market in July 1996. Periodic intervention by the Central Bank of Yemen has
enabled the riyal to gradually depreciate approximately 4 percent per year
since 1999. Its valued averaged YR191.5 per U.S. dollar in 2005, and has
averaged YR197.5 in 2006. In late November 2006, the exchange rate was about
YR198 per dollar. In March 2023 the exchange rate for new rials in government-
controlled areas was YR1,252 on average.

During the years immediately following unification (1990–96), Yemen
experienced a very high average rate of inflation, at 40%. Economic reforms
brought the inflation rate down to only 5.4 percent in 1997, but high oil
prices and cuts in the fuel subsidy in recent years have had a negative impact
on the inflation rate, which has generally been on the rise despite some
fluctuations. In 2004, efforts by the Central Bank of Yemen to tighten the
money supply were offset by a weakening U.S. dollar - to which the Yemeni
riyal is linked in a managed float - and by rising global commodity prices,
resulting in an inflation rate of 12.5%. In 2018 the inflation rate was
33.65%.

In July 2005, the government succumbed to public opposition and lowered the
new general sales tax from 10 to 5 percent. There are special rates for
telecommunication mobile services (10%) and cigarettes (90%).

## Banking and finance

According to economists, Yemen's financial services sector is underdeveloped
and dominated by the banking system. Yemen has no public stock exchange. The
banking system consists of the Central Bank of Yemen, 15 commercial banks
(nine private domestic banks, four of which are Islamic banks; four private
foreign banks; and two state-owned banks), and two specialized state-owned
development banks. The Central Bank of Yemen controls monetary policy and
oversees the transfer of currencies abroad. It is the lender of last resort,
exercises supervisory authority over commercial banks, and serves as a banker
to the government. Since the end of 2005 and up to the end of 2010, Tadhamon
International Islamic Bank has maintained the top spot of all banks in Yemen
(both Commercial and Islamic) in terms of total assets, capital, and trade
business. The largest commercial bank, the state-owned Credit and Agricultural
Cooperative Bank, and the majority state-owned Yemen Bank for Reconstruction
and Development are each currently being restructured with the goal of
eventual privatization. Because of fiscal difficulties in both banks, Yemen
government adopted a plan to merge all three banks in 2004; the new publicly
owned Development Bank will have a minimum capital of US$50 million. As of
April 2011, this step has not yet materialized.

The large volume of non-performing loans, low capitalization, and weak
enforcement of regulatory standards hamper Yemen's banking sector as a whole.
Numerous banks are technically insolvent. Because many debtors are in default,
Yemen's banks limit their lending activities to a select group of consumers
and businesses. As a result, the entire banking system holds less than 60
percent of the money supply; the bulk of the economy operates with cash.
Legislation adopted in 2000 gave the Central Bank the authority to enforce
tougher lending requirements, and in mid-2005 the Central Bank promulgated
several new capital requirements for commercial banks, together aimed at
curtailing currency speculation and protecting deposits.

In March 2023, the Houthi-controlled parliament in Sana’a passed a law banning
the charging of interest. MP Ahmed Saif said the law would have catastrophic
consequences for banks and citizens, the Minister of Finance and the governor
of the Sana’a-based Central Bank of Yemen refused to endorse the law publicly,
and a Sana’a banking official said that religious hardliners in the Houthi
movement had pushed for the legislation.

## Energy

Yemen's state-owned Public Electricity Corporation (PEC) operates an estimated
80 percent of the country's electricity generating capacity (810–900
megawatts) as well as the national power grid. Over the past 10 years, the
government has considered various means of alleviating the country's
significant electricity shortage, including restructuring the PEC, integrating
the power sector through small-scale privatization of power stations, creating
independent power projects (IPPs), and introducing gas-generated power plants
to free up oil supplies for export. However, because of inadequate
infrastructure, large-scale IPPs and privatization proposals have failed to
materialize; several smaller-scale projects in Mukalla and Aden, however, have
been completed, and contracts have been signed for future projects. In 2004,
Yemen's diesel-run power plants generated 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity, a level of production that is insufficient to maintain a
consistent supply of electricity. Although demand for electricity increased 20
percent between 2000 and 2004, it is estimated that only 40 percent of the
total population has access to electricity from the national power grid, and
supply is intermittent. To meet this demand, the government plans to increase
the country's power generating capacity to 1,400 megawatts by 2002.

## Government budget

In 1995, in order to comply with conditions stipulated by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Yemen began an economic reform program, one component of
which is fiscal policy reform aimed at reducing deficits and expanding the
revenue base. However, the government has failed to significantly reduce its
primary expenditure—subsidies, especially the fuel subsidy. In January 2005,
Yemen's parliament narrowly adopted a 2005 budget that forecast a reduced
budget deficit of about 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The budget
was predicated on the adoption of a reform package that included a broad-
based, 10 percent general sales tax (GST) and a 75 percent reduction in the
fuel subsidy. Strong public opposition to these reforms led the government in
July 2005 to defer the 10 percent GST for 18 months, adopting instead a hybrid
5 percent GST, and to modify the fuel subsidy reduction. Nonetheless, the cost
of subsidies, primarily for fuel, rose dramatically (almost 90 percent) in
2005, accounting for the largest share (almost 25 percent) of total government
expenditures and approximately 9 percent of GDP. These costs, coupled with a
24 percent increase in civil service wages and salaries and a 42 percent
increase in defense spending, resulted in a government budget deficit of
US$350.8 million, or more than 2 percent of GDP, in 2005. The government has
budgeted a sharp (41 percent) rise in overall spending for 2006, which
economists estimate will result in a fiscal deficit of US$800 million, or 4.2
percent of GDP.

## Foreign economic relations

### History and overview

During the 1990–91 Persian Gulf War, Yemen supported Iraq in its invasion of
Kuwait, thereby alienating Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which both had provided
critical financial assistance to Yemen. In addition to withdrawing this aid,
Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers. The resultant fall in
expatriate remittances had a disastrous impact on Yemen's governmental budget.
The civil war of 1994 further drained the economy, and in 1995 Yemen sought
the aid of multilateral agencies. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) granted Yemen a US$190 million stand-by credit facility, and the
following year it approved two funding facilities that increased the country's
credit by approximately US$500 million. The funding was contingent on Yemen's
adoption of stringent economic reforms, a requirement that the country had
limited success in fulfilling. As a result, the IMF suspended lending to Yemen
from late 1999 until February 2001. The extension of the two funding
facilities, particularly the poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF),
through October 2001 was again contingent on Yemen's commitment to economic
reform. Because of Yemen's failure to comply sufficiently with the terms
imposed by the IMF, since 2002 the IMF has withheld US$300 million in
concessional financing. Discussions over the renewal of the PRGF are ongoing.
In 2000 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia resumed financial aid to Yemen.

In October 2002, bilateral and multilateral lenders led by the World Bank
agreed to give Yemen a four-year economic support package worth US$2.3
billion, 20 percent in grants and 80 percent in concessional loans. This
funding is almost eight times the amount of financial support Yemen received
under the IMF's PRGF. However, in December 2005 the World Bank announced that
because of the government's continued inability to effect significant economic
reforms and stem corruption, funding would be reduced by more than one-third,
from US$420 million to US$240 million for the period July 2005 – July 2008. In
May 2006, the World Bank adopted a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Yemen for the period FY 2006 to FY 2009, providing a blueprint for fostering
the country's fiscal and human development improvement. The bank pledged to
contribute approximately US$400 million in International Development
Association (IDA) credits over the CAS time frame. At present, Yemen owes
approximately US$264 million to Japan, one of its largest donors. In December
2005, the Japanese government pledged to write off US$17 million of the debt.
That same month, Germany pledged to increase its annual aid to Yemen to
US$83.6 million over the next two years; funding will go primarily to
education and water improvement projects. In November 2006, the United Kingdom
announced that aid to Yemen would increase 400 percent, to US$222 million
through 2011.

Yemen is a member of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, which
since 1974 has contributed to the financing of economic and social development
in Arab states and countries through loans and guarantees. In March 2004, the
Arab League provided US$136 million to Yemen to finance infrastructure
improvements. At a mid-November 2006 meeting in London, a group of bilateral
and multilateral donors pledged US$4.7 billion over four years (2007–10) to
fund economic development in Yemen. The goal of the meeting, which was jointly
chaired by the World Bank and the government of Yemen, was to provide
sufficient economic aid to Yemen to enable it to qualify for future Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) membership. More than 55 percent of the aid, which
is primarily in the form of grants, will come from the GCC. Yemen was granted
observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, and its
application for full membership was under negotiation as of December 2006.

### Foreign trade

Imports totaled an estimated US$4.7 billion in 2005 and are projected to
increase to US$5 billion in 2006 and to US$5.4 billion in 2007. Yemen is a net
importer of all major categories of products except fuels. Principal imports
are machinery and transport equipment, food and livestock, and processed
materials. According to the United Nations, Yemen imports more than 75 percent
of its main dietary staple—wheat. The principal source of Yemen's imports in
2005 was the United Arab Emirates (13.4 percent of total imports); the bulk of
these imports are actually re-exports from the United States and Kuwait. Yemen
received 10.6 percent of its total imports from Saudi Arabia and 9 percent
from China.

In 2005 Yemen's exports totaled US$6.4 billion. Exports are expected to
increase to reach a record US$8.6 billion in 2006 as a result of strong oil
revenues. Petroleum is Yemen's main export, accounting for 92 percent of total
exports in 2004 and 87 percent in 2005. Yemen's non-oil exports are primarily
agricultural products, mainly fish and fish products, vegetables, and fruits.
In 2005 Asia was the most important market for Yemen's exports, primarily
China (37.3 percent of total exports), Thailand, and Japan. Chile was also a
primary export market (19.6 percent of total exports).

Yemen's import and export values have increased and decreased dramatically in
the past 10 years owing to shifts in global oil prices. As a result, the
country's trade balance has fluctuated significantly from a deficit of almost
US$800 million in 1998 to a surplus of US$1 billion in 2000. Rising oil prices
resulted in a surplus of US$817 million in 2004 and a surplus of US$1.7
billion in 2005.

In recent years, Yemen has reported increasing non-merchandise deficits. These
deficits have, however, been offset by record export earnings, which have
resulted in large enough trade surpluses to keep the current account in
surplus—US$175.7 million in 2003, US$524.6 million in 2004, and US$633.1
million (about 4 percent of gross domestic product) in 2005.

### External debt

In 1990 the newly unified Republic of Yemen inherited an unsustainable debt
burden amounting to roughly 106 percent of gross domestic product. Debt
rescheduling by the Paris Club creditor countries in the 1990s coupled with
assistance from the World Bank's International Development Agency resulted in
a drop in Yemen's debt stock to US$5.4 billion (an estimated 39 percent of
gross domestic product) by year-end 2004. According to the Central Bank of
Yemen, Yemen's debt stock was US$5.2 billion (an estimated 33 percent of gross
domestic product) by year-end 2005. According to the U.S. government, Yemen's
reserves of foreign exchange and gold were US$6.1 billion in 2005.

### Foreign investment

Yemen does not have a stock exchange, therefore limiting inward portfolio
investment. Portfolio investment abroad is also very limited, with the result
that portfolio flows are largely unrecorded by authorities. In the early
1990s, net direct investment was at its peak as foreign investors tapped
Yemeni oil reserves, but since 1995 net direct investment flows have been
negative because cost recovery for foreign oil companies has exceeded new
direct investment. A five-year US$3 billion liquid natural gas (LNG)
construction project involving a consortium of foreign companies is planned
following government approval in August 2005. Such a project raises the
prospect of increased foreign investment in the future as LNG facilities are
built.

### International aid

Beginning in the mid-1950s, the Soviet Union and China provided large-scale
assistance. For example, China was involved with the expansion of the Sana'a
International Airport. In the south, pre-independence economic activity was
overwhelmingly concentrated in the port city of Aden. The seaborne transit
trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the temporary closure of the
Suez Canal and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in 1967.[_citation needed_]

In early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and
administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the World Bank and
the IMF, as well as international donors. These programs had a positive impact
on Yemen's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than
3% of gross domestic product during the period 1995–1999 and the correction of
macro-financial imbalances. The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by
5.6% from 1995 to 1997.

Yemen is missing some international support because, as of 2024, it is one of
three countries which have not ratified the Paris Agreement to limit climate
change.
