The **economy of theCentral African Republic** is $2.321 billion by gross
domestic product as of 2019, even lower than much smaller countries such as
Barbados with an estimated annual per capita income of just $529 as measured
nominally in 2024.

Sparsely populated and landlocked, the Central African Republic is
overwhelmingly agrarian. The vast bulk of the population engages in
subsistence farming and 55% of the country's GDP derives from agriculture.
Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the
economy of the Central African Republic (CAR), with more than 70% of the
population living in outlying areas.

Principal food crops include cassava, peanuts, sorghum, millet, maize, sesame,
and plantains. Principal cash crops for export include cotton, coffee, and
tobacco. Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the diamond
industry for nearly 54%. Central African Republic is a least developed country
according to United Nations.

## Infrastructure

Though periodically unusable, the Oubangui River is nonetheless an important
transportation route.

Much of the country's limited electrical supply is provided by hydroelectric
plants located in Boali. Fuel supplies must be barged in via the Oubangui
River or trucked overland through Cameroon, resulting in frequent shortages of
gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The C.A.R.'s transportation and communication
network is limited. The country has only 429 kilometers of paved road, limited
international, and no domestic air service, and does not possess a railroad.

River traffic on the Oubangui River is impossible from April to July, and
conflict in the region has sometimes prevented shipments from moving between
Kinshasa and Bangui. The telephone system functions, albeit imperfectly. Four
radio stations operate in the C.A.R., as well as one television station.
Numerous newspapers and pamphlets are published on a regular basis, and one
company provides Internet access.

## Forestry

The country has rich but largely unexploited natural resources; meanwhile,
forestry remains an important contributor to the C. A. R. economy.

In 2014, the country exported 59.3 million US dollars of forest products such
as timber. This accounts for 40% of total export earnings in the C.A.R.

Foreign companies are involved in illegal logging activities in the country.
For example, in 2013, the French _Industrie forestière de Batalimo_ (IFB),
Lebanese _Société d’exploitation forestière centrafricaine_ (SEFCA) and
Chinese Vicwood Group reportedly made illegal tax payments totalling €3,7
million to the Ministry of Finance under the presidency of Michel Djotodia, as
well as monthly payments to Séléka fighters to safeguard their installations.
SEFCA also paid an additional "advance" of €380,876 directly to Djotodia's
government. According to a report from the UN Security Council, "illegal
artisanal exploitation surged in non-attributed forest areas" under the
Djotodia government, while logging trucks were "systematically subjected to
illegal tax levying". In 2014, the same companies paid approximately €127,864
to Anti-balaka militias at road checkpoints.

These illegal timber exploits continued in more recent years. The CEMAC banned
raw timber exports in January 2022, but the Central African Republic failed to
honor this ban. The ongoing timber trade has been linked since 2021 to a
"tripartite agreement" between government officials, Wagner Group mercenaries,
and a Russian company from Saint Petersburg named _Bois Rouge_ , with Wagner
having branched out into the timber industry and logging a forest in Lobaye.
The Wagner mercenaries reportedly invaded and "emptied" entire villages to log
timber at virtually no cost, creating a potential revenue of up to $890
million on international markets.

## Natural resources

The country has rich natural resources in the form of diamonds, gold, uranium,
and other minerals. Diamonds constitute one of the most important exports of
the CAR, frequently accounting for 20-30% of export revenues, but an estimated
30-50% of the diamonds produced each year leave the country
clandestinely.[_citation needed_] There may be petroleum deposits along the
country's northern border with Chad. (Two billion barrels of oil are present
in private estimates).[_citation needed_]

Diamonds are the only of these mineral resources currently being developed;
reported sales of largely uncut diamonds made up close to 60% of the CAR's
export earnings as of 2001. Industry contributes less than 20% of the
country's GDP, with artesian diamond mining, breweries, and sawmills making up
the bulk of the sector. Services account for 25% of GDP, largely because of
government bureaucracy and high transportation costs arising from the
country's landlocked position.

## Agriculture

74% (2013) of the population in the Central African Republic works in the
agriculture industry, so Central African Republic's economy is dominated by
the cultivation and sale of foodcrops such as yams, cassava, peanuts, maize,
sorghum, millet, sesame, and plantains. The importance of foodcrops over
exported cash crops is illustrated by the fact that the total production of
cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000
and 300,000 tons a year, while the production of cotton, the principal
exported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year.

Foodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the
principal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more
income from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash
crops such as cotton or coffee. Many rural and urban women also transform some
foodcrops into alcoholic drinks such as sorghum beer or hard liquor and derive
considerable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived
from the sale of foods and alcohol is not "on the books" and thus is not
considered in calculating per capita income, which is one reason why official
figures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.

The per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $400 a year,
said to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on
reported sales of exports and largely ignores the more important but
unregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcohol, diamonds, ivory,
bushmeat, and traditional medicines, for example. The informal economy of the
CAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.

Central African Republic produced in 2019:

  * 730 thousand tons of cassava;
  * 511 thousand tons of yam (7th largest producer in the world);
  * 143 thousand tons of peanut;
  * 140 thousand tons of taro;
  * 138 thousand tons of banana;
  * 120 thousand tons of sugar cane;
  * 90 thousand tons of maize;
  * 87 thousand tons of plantain;
  * 75 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 36 thousand tons of orange;
  * 30 thousand tons of sorghum;
  * 21 thousand tons of cotton;
  * 19 thousand tons of pumpkin;
  * 17 thousand tons of pineapple;
  * 12 thousand tons of mango;
  * 10 thousand tons of millet;
  * 10 thousand tons of coffee;
  * 8.5 thousand tons of avocado;
  * 6.7 thousand tons of sesame seed;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

## Finance and banking

The financial sector of the CAR, the smallest in the CEMAC, plays a limited
role in supporting economic growth. Suffering from weak market infrastructure
and legal and judicial frameworks, the financial system remains small,
undeveloped, and dominated by commercial banks. Because of economic and
security concerns, financial institutions, and particularly microfinance
institutions (MFIs), have consolidated their business in the capital, Bangui,
over the past few years.

With less than 1% of the total population holding a bank account, access to
financial services is extremely limited in the CAR. Microfinance accounts only
for 1% of the total credit facilities, serving 0.5 percent of the population.
Low levels of mobile penetration – which stand at 30%, a significantly lower
percentage than in the rest of the continent – dampen the potential expansion
of access to financial services through mobile technology. In April 2022, the
country announced that it will adopt the cryptocurrency bitcoin as legal
tender.

## Economic aid and development

The CAR is heavily dependent upon multilateral foreign aid and the presence of
numerous NGO's which provide numerous services which the government fails to
provide. As one UNDP official put it, the CAR is a country "sous serum," or a
country hooked up to an IV (Mehler 2005:150). The presence of numerous foreign
personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and refugee
camps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central
Africans.[_citation needed_]

In the 40 years since independence, the CAR has made slow progress toward
economic development. Economic mismanagement, poor infrastructure, a limited
tax base, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led
to deficits in both its budget and external trade. Its debt burden is
considerable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita gross national
product over the last 40 years.

Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked
position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a
legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the
currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed
effects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
increased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in
1995.

Military rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread
destruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the
government and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and
political representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and
reduced tax revenues for the government.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an Extended Structure
Adjustment Facility in 1998. The government has set targets of annual 5%
growth and 25% inflation for 2000–2001. Structural adjustment programs with
the World Bank and IMF and interest-free credits to support investments in the
agriculture, livestock, and transportation sectors have had limited impact.
The World Bank and IMF are now encouraging the government to concentrate
exclusively on implementing much-needed economic reforms to jump-start the
economy and defining its fundamental priorities with the aim of alleviating
poverty. As a result, many of the state-owned business entities have been
privatized and limited efforts have been made to standardize and simplify
labor and investment codes and to address problems of corruption. The Central
African Government is currently in the process of adopting new labor and
investment codes.
