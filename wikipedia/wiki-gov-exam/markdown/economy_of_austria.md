The **economy of Austria** is a highly developed social market economy, with
the country being one of the fourteen richest in the world in terms of GDP
(gross domestic product) per capita. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's
largest industry firms were nationalised. In recent years, privatisation has
reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.
Among OECD nations, Austria has a highly efficient and strong social security
system; social expenditure stood at roughly 29.4% of GDP.

Labor movements are particularly strong in Austria, and they have a large
influence on labor politics. Next to a highly developed industry,
international tourism is the most important part of the national economy. The
economy of Austria's average GDP is 13th growth in OECD countries, from 1992
to 2017. In Austria, 1.37% over average population growth is the strong
factor.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making the
Austrian economy vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. However,
since Austria became a member state of the European Union, it has gained
closer ties to other European Union economies. This development reduced its
economic dependence on Germany. In addition, Austria's membership in the EU
has drawn an influx of foreign investors.

They were attracted by Austria's access to the European Single Market and the
country's proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in
GDP has accelerated in recent years, and reached 3.3% in 2006.

In 2024 Austria has a very high, $58,669 nominal GDP per capita ranked 13th.

Vienna was ranked the fifth richest NUTS-2 region within Europe (see Economy
of the European Union), with its GDP reaching €38,632 per capita. It was
trailing behind Inner London, Luxembourg, the Brussels-Capital Region and
Hamburg.

Growth had been steady between 2002 and 2006, varying between 1 and 3.3%.
After hitting 0% in 2013, growth had picked up a little. As of 2016, growth
was set at 1.5%.

### Foundation and _Interbellum_

First Austrian Republic, founded as a result of the dissolution of Austria-
Hungary, inherited an economy battered by the ravages of the First World War,
namely:

  * The abolition of the gold standard in 1914.
  * Provision by the central bank of credit to the state, increasing the money supply.
  * The balance-of-payments deficit caused by the Austrian need to import food and fuel, devaluing the krone (the Austrian currency at the time).
  * The use of deficit spending to finance food subsidies, leading to a 12-fold increase of banknotes in circulation.

A number of international relief schemes failed to garner enough support while
a report by Sir William Goode argued that the Austrian economy would collapse
without swift foreign intervention. As such, the Austrian economic crisis
stretched into its second year, with inflation running at 99%.

#### League of Nations Bailout

Source:

With annual inflation running at 2,877%, the League of Nations was officially
appointed to organise an Austrian reconstruction plan in August 1922. The
League scheme was based on the view that Austrian troubles as a result of an
inability to pay for necessities and obtain credit, and therefore, an Austrian
financial revival was critical to Austrian survival. To this end, the plan was
focused solely on financial reconstruction. Austria would receive loans raised
from international money markets and the Austrian public, which would be
secured on customs and tobacco taxes. In exchange, Austria would in effect
lose sovereignty over its economy, agreeing to:

  * Relinquish control over the mints to an independent bank, with the aim of returning to the gold standard.
  * Terminate the printing of money by the central bank.
  * Eliminate the budget deficit (requiring the implementation of austerity measures and monetary control).

The measures took effect in 1923. Short-term effects were impressive; during
the announcement to undertake Austrian reconstruction in August 1922, public
confidence soared. Foreign currency holdings were converted back into krone,
stabilising the currency. This allowed the Austrian Foreign Exchange Agency to
finally intervene to fix the krone to the dollar, something that the wild
gyrations of the past had not permitted. Capital rushed back into Austria, and
domestic prices stabilised, pronouncing the end of hyperinflation.

The steam ran out shortly after implementation. Growth averaged 0.35% per
annum until 1929, unemployment leapt five-fold, bankruptcies increased
41-fold, and the trade deficit doubled.

### _Anschluss_

Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, and consequently lost control of
its own economic policy until the formation of the Second Republic in 1945.

### Post World War II

Ever since the end of the World War II, Austria has achieved sustained
economic growth. In the soaring 1950s, the rebuilding efforts for Austria lead
to an average annual growth rate of more than 5% in real terms and averaged
about four-point five percent through most of the 1960s. Following moderate
real GDP growth of 1.7%, 2% and 1.2%, respectively, in 1995, 1996, and 1997,
the economy rebounded and with real GDP expansion of 2.9 percent in 1998 and
2.2% in 1999.

Austria became a member of the EU on 1 January 1995. Membership brought
economic benefits and challenges and has drawn an influx of foreign investors
attracted by Austria's access to the single European market. Austria also has
made progress in generally increasing its international competitiveness. As a
member of the economic and monetary union of the European Union (EMU),
Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member countries,
especially with Germany. On 1 January 1999, Austria introduced the new Euro
currency for accounting purposes. In January 2002, Euro notes and coins were
introduced, replacing those of the Austrian schilling.

## Currency

In 1999, Austria introduced the single European currency, the euro. With 18
other EU member states it forms the Eurozone.

In Austria, Euros appear as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced
in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the Eurozone where
mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value,
were selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new
common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common
side of its coins.

Before adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the Austrian
schilling which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was
abolished in the wake of the Anschluss in 1938 and has been reintroduced after
the end of the World War II in November 1945.

Austria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the
Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro
coin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old
national practice of minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues,
these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a €5
Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

## Privatisation, state participation and labour movements

Many of the country's largest firms were nationalised in the early post-war
period to protect them from Soviet takeover as war reparations. For many
years, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a
very important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early
1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate
largely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly
or partially privatised. The government still operates some firms, state
monopolies, utilities, and services. Due to the 2008 financial crisis, two
banks were nationalised. Since 2019 the Österreichische Industrieholding
(ÖBAG) administers the investments of the Republic of Austria in partially or
entirely nationalized companies, but came under strong criticism after leaked
messages showed how Thomas Schmidt had a say in the appointment of the
supervisory board and became sole director. Austria enjoys well-developed
industry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.

Austria has a strong labour movement. The Austrian Trade Union Federation
(ÖGB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5
million—more than half the country's wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the
ÖGB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with
industry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and
economic issues in what is known as Austria's "social partnership". The ÖGB
has often opposed the Schüssel government's programme for budget
consolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and
indications are rising that Austria's peaceful social climate could become
more confrontational.

## Agriculture, industry and services

Austrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are
small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive. Since Austria's
becoming a member of the EU in 1995, the Austrian agricultural sector has been
undergoing substantial reform under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
Although Austrian farmers provide about 80% of domestic food requirements, the
agricultural contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has declined since
1950 to less than 3%.

Although some industries are global competitors, such as several iron and
steel works, chemical plants and oil corporations that are large industrial
enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial
enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.

Kitzbühel, one of Austria's famous winter tourist cities

Most important for Austria is the service sector generating the vast majority
of Austria's GDP. Vienna has grown into a finance and consulting metropole and
has established itself as the door to the East within the last decades.
Viennese law firms and banks are among the leading corporations in business
with the new EU member states. Tourism is very important for Austria's
economy, accounting for around 10 percent of Austria's GDP. In 2001, Austria
was the tenth most visited country in the world with over 18.2 million
tourists. Previously, dependency on German guests made this sector of the
Austrian economy very dependent on German economy. However recent developments
have brought a change, especially since winter ski resorts such as Arlberg or
Kitzbühel are now more and more frequented by Eastern Europeans, Russians and
Americans.

Austria produced in 2018:

  * 2.3 million tons of sugar beet (the beet is used to manufacture sugar and ethanol);
  * 2.1 million tons of maize;
  * 1.3 million tons of wheat;
  * 697 thousand tons of potato;
  * 695 thousand tons of barley;
  * 387 thousand tons of apple;
  * 367 thousand tons of grape;
  * 278 thousand tons of triticale;
  * 184 thousand tons of soybean;
  * 177 thousand tons of rye (12th largest world producer);
  * 132 thousand tons of onion;
  * 120 thousand tons of rapeseed;
  * 111 thousand tons of pear;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

Trade with other EU countries accounts for almost 66% of Austrian imports and
exports. Expanding trade and investment in the emerging markets of central and
eastern Europe is a major element of Austrian economic activity. Trade with
these countries accounts for almost 14% of Austrian imports and exports, and
Austrian firms have sizable investments in and continue to move labour-
intensive, low-tech production to these countries. Although the big investment
boom has waned, Austria still has the potential to attract EU firms seeking
convenient access to these developing markets.

## Mergers and acquisitions

The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) landscape in Austria has witnessed
significant activity, with companies and investors from the country actively
engaging in such transactions. Since 1991, more than 7,183 M&A deals have been
announced, amounting to a known total value of 261.6 billion EUR. In 2017
alone, there were over 245 deals with a combined value exceeding 12.9 billion
EUR.

Austrian companies have not only been involved in domestic M&A transactions
but have also emerged as important investors in cross-border M&A ventures.
Among the countries where Austrian companies have been active in M&A, Germany
stands out as a particularly crucial partner. To date, Austrian parent
companies have acquired 854 German companies in outbound M&A deals,
highlighting the strong bilateral ties between the two nations.

When analyzing the industries that have witnessed the most M&A activity in
Austria, the financial sector emerges as a prominent player in terms of
transaction value. The financial industry has been the focus of significant
M&A deals, with companies in this sector exploring opportunities to strengthen
their market positions, expand their product portfolios, and enhance their
capabilities.

On the other hand, when considering the number of transactions, the
Industrials sector takes the lead, representing approximately 19.2% of the
total M&A deals in Austria. This sector encompasses a wide range of
industries, including manufacturing, engineering, construction, and
transportation, among others. The strong presence of M&A activity in the
Industrials sector signifies the ongoing interest in consolidating businesses,
driving synergies, and fostering growth through strategic partnerships and
acquisitions.

The M&A landscape in Austria continues to evolve, influenced by various
factors such as market dynamics, economic conditions, and global trends. As
companies seek opportunities for expansion, diversification, and innovation,
M&A transactions will remain a strategic tool for achieving their business
objectives. The financial sector and the Industrials sector are likely to
remain at the forefront of M&A activity, demonstrating the vibrancy and
potential for further growth in these industries.

### Companies

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Austria
is Services with 97,733 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real
Estate and Retail Trade with 70,696 and 59,942 companies respectively.
