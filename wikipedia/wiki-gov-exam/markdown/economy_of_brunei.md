The **economy of Brunei** , a small and wealthy country, is a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare
measures, and village traditions. Brunei has a mixed economic system which
includes a variety of private freedom, combined with centralized economic
planning and government regulation. It is almost entirely supported by exports
of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector
accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP is high, and substantial
income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production.
The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and
housing. The government has[_citation needed_] shown progress in its basic
policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are
concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will
undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a
more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 was estimated at 2.5% due to
higher oil prices in the second half.

Brunei is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, averaging about
180,000 barrels per day (29,000 m3/d). It also is the ninth-largest producer
of liquefied natural gas in the world.

In the 1970s, Brunei invested sharply increasing revenues from petroleum
exports and maintained government spending at a low and constant rate.
Consequently, the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest
them around the world to help provide for future generations. Part of the
reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's
annual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased,
and government spending has increased. The government has been running a
budget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made
Brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.

Brunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price
increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly
in each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.

This drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in
world markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered
somewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In
recent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an
estimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5
billion, well below the 1980 peak.

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the
price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in Brunei's economy. In
addition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's
largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy,
caused the country to slip into a mild recession.

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at
market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in
millions of Bruneian dollars.

Year | Gross domestic product | US dollar exchange | Inflation index (2000=100)   
---|---|---|---  
1985 | 7,777 | 2.20 Bruneian dollars | 76   
1990 | 6,509 | 1.81 Bruneian dollars | 82   
1995 | 7,394 | 1.41 Bruneian dollars | 95   
2000 | 7,441 | 1.72 Bruneian dollars | 100   
2005 | 10,401 | 1.62 Bruneian dollars | 100   
  
For purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1.52
Bruneian dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per man-hour in 2009.

The government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it
might disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only
for short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions,
foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government
reported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of
5.5%.

Oil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products
other than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be
imported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of
imports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some
transshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and
Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries,
Japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction
equipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was
the third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.

Brunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment
Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. BIA's guiding
principle is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while
pursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States,
Japan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries.

The Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New
enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting
profits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital
invested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal
income tax or capital gains tax.

One of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the
development of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no
specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation,
both shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps
when tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.

Companies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a
branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of
Companies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private
companies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders. At
least half of the directors in a company must be residents of Brunei.

Between 1981 and 2013 the Sultan owned cattle stations in Australia that
supplied most of the country's beef. In 1984 it was reported that at 2,262
square miles (5,860 km2), the total area of the stations was larger than
Brunei itself. Some of the stations were sold in 2006 and 2014. As of 2019,
the Sultan still owned the Opium Creek station. Eggs and chickens are largely
produced locally, but most of Brunei's other food needs must be imported.
Agriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government
has selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy.

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1983–2021 (with IMF
staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.

## Oil and gas industry

Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP), a joint venture owned in equal shares by the
Brunei Government and Shell, is the chief oil and gas production company in
Brunei. It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister
companies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government.
BSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of 10,000 barrels per day
(1,600 m3/d). This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.

The French oil company Elf Aquitaine became active in petroleum exploration in
Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered
commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells
drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in
early 1990. Recently, UNOCAL, partnered with New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge
has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to
tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.

Brunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over 240,000 barrels per day (38,000
m3/d). Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of oil
reserves and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently
averaging some 200,000 barrels per day (32,000 m3/d). Japan has traditionally
been the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from
45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South
Korea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major
customers include Taiwan (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil
exports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.

Almost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at Brunei Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG) plant, which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in
the world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-
term agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over
5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese
company, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei
Government in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which
together produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has
supplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well.
In 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small
amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the
fourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Australia.

Brunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient, as of 2015, to last until
at least 2035. Deep sea exploration may find significant new reserves but can
be prohibitively expensive. The government sought in the past decade to
diversify the economy with limited success. Oil and gas and government
spending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-
petroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.

In 2015, Brunei registered its third year of economic recession, the only
ASEAN nation to do so. Declining oil prices and a drop in production due to
maintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country's
budget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016–17.

In 2020, more than 99% of produced electricity in Brunei was based on fossil
fuels, while electricity produced from renewable energy accounted for less
than 1%. It is advised for Brunei to diversify the economy away from the use
of fossil fuels and focus more on renewable energy as part of climate change
mitigation measures.

## Petrochemical industry

In the western part of the country, Liang is currently experiencing a major
development with the establishment of SPARK, which is a 271-hectare (670-acre)
site developed to be a world-class petrochemical hub. The first major
investment at SPARK is the US$450 million Methanol plant developed by the
Brunei Methanol Company, a joint venture between Petroleum Brunei and two
leading Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings and Itochu. The plant
design will give an output of 2,500t of methanol per day (850,000t annually).
The plant was officially launched by Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah on 25
May 2010.

## Halal brand

Brunei Darussalam in July 2009 launched its national halal branding scheme
Brunei Halal which allows manufacturers in Brunei and in other countries to
use the premium Brunei Halal trademark to help them penetrate lucrative
markets in countries with significant numbers of Muslim consumers. The Brunei
Halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global
halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the
consumption needs of Muslims worldwide.[_citation needed_]

As envisioned by the Sultanate, the use of the Brunei Halal brand would
signify to Muslim consumers the manufacturers' strict compliance with laws
relating to Islamic teachings. Brunei also aims to build confidence in the
brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the
products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of
raw materials, manufacturing process, logistics and distribution.[_citation
needed_]

A new company, government-owned Brunei Wafirah Holdings Sdn Bhd, has been
established as the owner of the Brunei Halal brand. Wafirah has entered into a
joint venture with Brunei Global Islamic Investment and Hong Kong-based
logistics firm Kerry FSDA Limited to form Ghanim International Food
Corporation Sdn Bhd. Ghanim International manages the use of the Brunei Halal
trademark. Producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire
the Brunei halal label (or the certification for compliance with accepted
manufacturing and slaughtering practices under Islam) through the Department
of Syariah Affairs' Halal Food Control Section. They can then approach Ghanim
for their application to use the brand.[_citation needed_]
