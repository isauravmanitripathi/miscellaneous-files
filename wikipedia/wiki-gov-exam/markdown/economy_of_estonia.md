The **economy of Estonia** is rated advanced by the World Bank, i.e. with high
quality of life and advanced infrastructure relative to less industrialized
nations. Estonia is a member of the European Union, the eurozone, and the
OECD. The economy is heavily influenced by developments in the Finnish and
Swedish economies.

After Estonia restored its independence in 1991 and became a market economy,
it emerged as a pioneer in the global economy. Estonia styled itself as a
bridge between East and West, adopting significant economic reforms and
technological innovations. In 1992, the country adopted the Estonian kroon as
its currency, this stabilised the economy. In 1994, it became the first
country in the world to adopt a flat tax, with a rate of 26% regardless of
personal income. Estonia received more foreign investment, per person, in the
late 1990s than any other country in Central and Eastern Europe. The country
has been catching-up with the EU-15 \- the richer European countries. Its GDP
per capita grew from 35% of the EU-15 average in 1996 to 65% in 2007, similar
to Central European countries. GDP per capita (current US$) was $30,133 in
2023 according to the World Bank; this was between the Czech Republic and
Bahrain, but below Saudi Arabia.

For Estonia, the 2008 financial crisis was easier to weather, because its
budget has consistently been kept balanced, and this meant public debt
relative to GDP remained the lowest in Europe. The economy recovered in 2010.
In January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro, joining the eurozone. Estonia has
demonstrated resilience, with a strong service sector, particularly in IT due
to the Tiigrihüpe project, and advanced e-government services. Estonia's
commitment to a circular economy, innovation and its success in maintaining a
balanced budget, low public debt, and a competitive tax system have positioned
it as a model of economic reform and growth in post-Soviet Europe.

## History

In the decades prior to World War I and independence, during the Czarist rule
a rather large industrial sector developed in Estonia. For example, the
Kreenholm Manufacturing Company was then the world's largest cotton mill.

### Independence

After declaring independence in 1918, the Estonian War of Independence and the
subsequent signing of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, the new Estonian state
inherited a ruined post-war economy and an inflated ruble currency. Despite
considerable hardship, dislocation, and unemployment, Estonia spent the first
decade of independence entirely transforming its economy. In 1918, The Czarist
ruble was replaced by the Estonian mark, which was in circulation until 1927.
By 1929, a stable currency, the kroon, had been established. It was issued by
the Bank of Estonia, the country's central bank. Compensating the German
landowners for their holdings, the government confiscated the estates and
divided them into small farms, which subsequently formed the basis of Estonian
prosperity. Trade focused on the local market and the West, particularly
Germany and the United Kingdom. Only 3% of all commerce was with the USSR.

Historically, Estonia's economy was agricultural, modernising significantly
post-independence from Russia in 1918. There was a notable knowledge sector in
Tartu and expanding industrial sector, exemplified by the Kreenholm
Manufacturing Company. Western European markets were familiar with Estonian
dairy, with the main trade partners being Germany and the UK; only 3% of
commerce was with the neighbouring USSR. Estonia and Finland had a similar
standard of living. USSR's annexation of Estonia in 1940 and destruction
during World War II crippled the economy. Post-war Sovietization continued,
with the integration of Estonia's economy into the USSR's centrally-planned
structure.

### Soviet occupation

The USSR's forcible annexation of Estonia in 1940 and the ensuing Nazi and
Soviet destruction during World War II crippled the Estonian economy. Post-war
Soviet occupation and Sovietisation of life continued with the integration of
Estonia's economy and industry into the USSR's centrally planned structure.
More than 56% of Estonian farms were collectivised in the month of April 1949
alone after mass deportations to Siberia the previous month. Moscow expanded
on those Estonian industries which had locally available raw materials, such
as oil shale mining and phosphorites.

### Restoration of independence, modernisation and liberalisation

After Estonia restored its independence in 1991 and became a market economy,
it emerged as a pioneer in the global economy. Estonia styled itself as a
bridge between East and West, adopting significant economic reforms and
technological innovations.

In June 1992, Estonia replaced the ruble with its own freely convertible
currency, the kroon. A currency board was created and the new currency was
pegged to the German Mark at the rate of 8 Estonian kroons per Deutsche Mark.
When Germany introduced the euro the peg was changed to 15.6 kroons per euro.

In 1994, it became the first country in the world to adopt a flat tax, with a
rate of 26% regardless of personal income. Between 2005 and 2008, this was
reduced to 21% over several steps.

In early 1992, both liquidity problems and structural weakness stemming from
the communist era precipitated a banking crisis. As a result, effective
bankruptcy legislation was enacted and privately owned; well-managed banks
emerged as market leaders. The fully electronic Tallinn Stock Exchange opened
in early 1996, and was purchased by Finland's Helsinki Stock Exchange in 2001.
Estonia joined the World Trade Organization in 1999.

From the early 2000s to the latter part of that decade, the economy
experienced considerable growth. In 2000, Estonian GDP grew by 6.4%. After
accession to the European Union in 2004, double-digit growth was soon
observed. GDP grew by 8% in 2007 alone. Increases in labor costs, the
imposition of tax on tobacco, alcohol, electricity, fuel, gas, and other
external pressures (growing prices of oil and food on the global market)
inflated prices in 2009.

### 2008 financial crisis, response and recovery

Real GDP growth in Estonia, 2002–2012.

The 2008 financial crisis had a deep effect on the economy, primarily as a
result of an investment and consumption slump, that followed the burst of the
real estate market bubble that had been building up. In December 2008, Estonia
became a donor country to the IMF-led rescue package for Latvia. In response
to the crisis, the Ansip government opted for fiscal consolidation and
retrenchment by maintaining fiscal discipline and a balanced budget in
combination with austerity packages: The government increased taxes, and
reduced public spending by slashing expenditures and public salaries across
the board.

After a long period of very high growth of GDP, the GDP of Estonia decreased.
In the first quarter 2008, GDP grew only 0.1%, and then decreased: negative
growth was −1.4% in the 2nd quarter, a little over −3% (on a year-to-year
basis) in the 3rd quarter, and −9.4% in the 4th quarter of that year.

The government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by the
Riigikogu. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6.1 billion
and the expenditure by EEK 3.2 billion. A current account-deficit was extant,
but began to shrink in late 2008. In 2009, the economy further contracted by
15% in the first quarter. Low domestic and foreign demand depressed the
economy's overall output. The economy's 34% industrial production drop was the
sharpest decrease in industrial production in the European Union. Estonia was
one of the five worst-performing economies in the world in terms of annual
growth, and had one of the hightest rates of unemployment in the EU, which
rose from 4% in May 2008 to 16% in May 2009.

In July 2009, the value-added tax was increased from 18% to 20%. The recorded
budget deficit for 2009 was just 1.7% of GDP. The result was, that Estonia was
one of only five EU countries in 2009 that met the Maastricht criteria for
debt and deficit, and had the third-lowest deficit after Luxembourg and
Sweden; Estonia did not ask for support from the IMF. Despite the third-
largest drop in GDP, the country had the lowest budget deficit and lowest
public debt among Central and Eastern European countries. In 2009, the
Estonian economy began to rebound, and economic growth resumed in the second
half of 2010. The country's unemployment rate dropped significantly to pre-
recession levels. To top it off, Estonia was granted permission in 2010 to
join the eurozone in 2011.

### Joining the euro

Before joining the eurozone, the Estonian kroon had been pegged to the euro at
a rate of 15.64664 EEK to one euro; before then, the kroon was pegged to the
German mark at approximately 8 EEK to 1 DEM.

The design of Estonian euro coins was finalized in late 2004. Estonia's
journey towards the euro took longer than originally projected, owing to the
inflation rate continually being above the required 3% before 2010, which
prevented the country from fulfilling the entry criteria. The country
originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007 and officially changed
its target date twice: first to 1 January 2008, and later to 1 January 2011.

On 12 May 2010, the European Commission announced that Estonia had met all
criteria to join the eurozone. On 8 June 2010, EU finance ministers. In July
2010, Estonia received the final approval from ECOFIN to adopt the euro
onwards from 1 January 2011; on that date Estonia became the 17th eurozone
member state and circulated alongside the kroon until 14 January 2011. With
that, Estonia became one of the first post-Soviet states to join the eurozone.

In August 2011, Standard & Poor's raised Estonia's credit rating from A to
AA-. Among various factors, S&P cited as contributing to its decision was
confidence in Estonia's ability to "sustain strong economic growth." Estonia's
GDP growth rate in 2011 was above 8%, despite having negative population
growth.

The Estonian economy was hit by the COVID-19 recession before bouncing back
with an 8.6% rise in GDP in 2021, this was followed by the economic effect of
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulting in a fall in GDP of
1.3% in 2022 and high inflation which hit 24% before falling to single digits
in 2023.

## The economy today

"Since reestablishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway
between East and West and pursued economic reform and integration with the
West." Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the
former COMECON area.[_citation needed_] A balanced budget, almost non-existent
public debt, flat-rate income tax, free trade regime, adoption of the euro,
competitive commercial banking sector, hospitable environment for foreign
investment, innovative e-Services and mobile-based services are hallmarks of
Estonia's free-market-based economy.[_citation needed_]

The privatisation of state-owned firms is virtually complete, with only the
port and main power plants remaining in government hands.[_citation needed_]
The constitution requires a balanced budget, and the protection afforded by
Estonia's intellectual property laws is similar to that of the EU. Near-ideal
conditions for the banking sector exist. Foreigners are not restricted from
buying bank shares or acquiring majority holdings.[_citation needed_]

In 2013, the average monthly gross wage in Estonia was €980 (US$1,330). This
figure has grown consistently to €2,065 (US$2,217) as of December 2023.

Estonia offers unique tax conditions for businesses, where the tax on
undistributed profits is 0%. This allows companies that reinvest their profits
into development to avoid tax obligations and allocate more funds for growth
and expansion. In 2024, Estonia holds the first place in the International Tax
Competitiveness Index and on a permanent basis is taking top positions in the
Economic Freedom Index (8th place) and in the Ease of Doing Business Index
(18th place).

## Projections and circular economy

In 2011, according to projections made by CEPII by 2050, Estonia could become
the most productive country in the EU, after Luxembourg, and so join the top
five most productive nations in the world.

According to the Ministry of Environment, Estonia committed to developing a
circular economy strategic document and action plan by 2021. In March 2020,
the Estonian Circular Economy Industries Association, specified that Estonia
should consider the new European Green Deal and principles of circular economy
when making investments to recover the economy after Covid.

## Employment participation

Unemployment rate as a percentage of the labor force in Estonia according to
Statistics Estonia.

Estonia has around 600,000 employees, yet the country has a shortage of
skilled labor, and since skill shortages are experienced everywhere in Europe,
the government has increased working visa quota for non-EEA citizens, although
it has nevertheless been criticized for being inadequate for addressing the
shortages.

The late-2000s recession in the world, the near-concurrent local property bust
with changes in Estonian legislation to increase labour market flexibility
(making it easier for companies to lay off workers) saw Estonia's unemployment
rate shoot up to 18.8% throughout the duration of the crisis, then stabilise
to 13.8% by summer 2011, as the economy recovered on the basis of strong
exports. Internal consumption, and therefore imports, plummeted; and cuts were
made in public finances. Some of the reduction in unemployment has been
attributed to some Estonians' emigrating for employment to Finland, the UK,
Australia, and elsewhere.

After the recession, the unemployment rate went lower, and throughout 2015 and
2016, the rate stayed near the levels that preceded the economic downturn,
staying at just above 6%. In 2020-2023 the unemployment rate moved around
between 5.2% and 7.7%.

## Sectors

Tallinn has emerged as the country's financial center. According to Invest in
Estonia, advantages of Estonian financial sector are unbureaucratic
cooperation between companies and authorities, and relative abundance of
educated people although young educated Estonians tend to emigrate to western
Europe for greater income. The largest banks are Swedbank, SEB Pank, and
Nordea. Several IPOs have been made recently on the Tallinn Stock Exchange, a
member OMX system.

The Estonian service sector employs over 60% of workforce. Estonia has a
strong information technology (IT) sector, partly due to the Tiigrihüpe
project undertaken in mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most "wired"
and advanced country in Europe in the terms of e-government.

Farming, which had been forcibly collectivized for decades until the
transition era of 1990–1992, has become privatized and more efficient, and the
total farming area has increased in the period following Estonia's restoration
of independence. The share of agriculture in the gross domestic product
decreased from 15% to 3.3% during 1991–2000, while employment in agriculture
decreased from 15% to 5.2%.

The mining industry makes up 1% of the GDP. Mined commodities include oil
shale, peat, and industrial minerals, such as clays, limestone, sand and
gravel. Soviets created badly polluting industry in the early 1950s,
concentrated in the north-east of the country. Socialist economy and military
areas left the country highly polluted, and mainly because of oil shale
industry in Ida-Virumaa, sulfur dioxide emissions per person are almost as
high as in the Czech Republic. The coastal seawater is polluted in certain
locations, mainly the east. The government is looking for ways to reduce
pollution further. In 2000, the emissions were 80% smaller than in 1980, and
the amount of unpurified wastewater discharged to water bodies was 95% smaller
than in 1980.

Estonian productivity is experiencing rapid growth, and consequently wages are
also rising quickly, with a rise in private consumption of about 8% in 2005.
According to Estonian Institute of Economic Research, the largest contributors
to GDP growth in 2005 were processing industry, financial intermediation,
retailing and wholesale trade, transport and communications.

### Agriculture

Estonia produced in 2018:

  * 450 thousand tons of wheat;
  * 347 thousand tons of barley;
  * 113 thousand tons of rapeseed;
  * 88 thousand tons of potato;
  * 78 thousand tons of oat;
  * 53 thousand tons of pea;
  * 29 thousand tons of rye;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

## Infrastructure

Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary energy. Oil shale
extraction in VKG Ojamaa mine.

Railway transport dominates the cargo sector, comprising 70% of all carried
goods, domestic and international. Road transport is the one that prevails in
the passenger sector, accounting for over 90% of all transported passengers. 5
major cargo ports offer easy navigational access, deep waters, and good ice
conditions. There are 12 airports and 1 heliport in Estonia. Lennart Meri
Tallinn Airport is the largest airport in Estonia, with 1,73 million
passengers and 22,764 tons of cargo (annual cargo growth 119.7%) in 2007.
International flight companies such as SAS, Finnair, Lufthansa, EasyJet, and
Nordic Aviation Group provide direct flights to 27 destinations.

Approximately 7.5% of the country's workforce is employed in transportation
and the sector contributes over 10% of GDP. Estonia is getting much business
from traffic between European Union and Russia, especially oil cargo through
Estonian ports. Transit trade's share of GDP is disputed, but many agree that
Russia's increased hostility is decreasing the share.

Instead of coal, electricity is generated by burning oil shale, with largest
stations in Narva. Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary
energy. Other energy sources are natural gas imported from Russia, wood, motor
fuels, and fuel oils.

Wind power in Estonia amounts to 58.1 megawatts, whilst roughly 399 megawatts
worth of projects are currently being developed. Estonian energy
liberalization is lagging far behind the Nordic energy market. During the
accession negotiations with the EU, Estonia agreed that at least 35% of the
market are opened before 2009 and all of non-household market, which totals
around 77% of consumption, before 2013. Estonia is concerned that Russia could
use energy markets to bully it. In 2009, the government considered granting
permits to nuclear power companies, and there were plans for a shared nuclear
facility with Latvia and Lithuania. Those plans were shelved after the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011.

Estonia has high Internet penetration, and connections are available
throughout most of the country.
