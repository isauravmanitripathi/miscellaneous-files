The **economy of Vatican City** is mainly supported financially by the sale of
stamps, coins, medals, and tourist mementos as well as fees for admission to
museums and publication sales. Vatican City employed 4,822 people in 2016.

The Vatican City receives subsidies from the Italian state, which include the
water supply free of charge, tax exemptions and other kinds of dedicated
public funding.

Vatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its
currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European
Union (council decision 1999/98). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1
January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-
denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than
usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy. Because
of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.
