The **economy of Algeria** deals with Algeria's current and structural
economic situation. Currently, Algeria has a mixed economy. Since independence
in 1962, Algeria has launched major economic projects to build up a dense
industrial base. However, despite these major achievements (roads, freeways,
universities, hospitals, factories, housing, metro and tramway systems, etc.),
the Algerian economy has gone through various stages of turbulence.

In the 1980s, the Algerian economy experienced major difficulties. The oil
counter-shock of 1986 dealt a heavy blow to a virtually rentier economy,
during the period of anti-scarcity and stabilization plans. In the early
1990s, Algeria embarked on a series of structural reforms, making the
transition to a market economy a reality.

In 2012, the Algerian economy remains highly dependent on hydrocarbon rents,
which represent the country's main source of revenue, without having succeeded
in diversifying and establishing internationally competitive
industrialization.

The 2017 report on Algeria by business intelligence and consultancy firm
Oxford Business Group (OGB), highlights the efforts devoted by the country to
strengthening and diversifying its economy against the backdrop of falling oil
prices. The report highlights the growing contribution of the private sector
to GDP, in particular the role of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
supported by new measures; as well as the financial services sector, which has
seen positive developments such as the introduction of online payments.

Despite the efforts made, the country still faces a number of short-term
problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political,
economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce social
inequality between regions, in order to achieve better economic growth.
Algeria has the triple leverage of energy, mining and agriculture to
contribute, in the long term, to containing the supply crises in energy, rare
earths (minerals useful for technology) and food.

Published in 2023, the World Bank's report on the Algerian economy calls for
the acceleration of institutional and micro-economic reforms, and paints a
positive picture for the country's economy. The World Bank notes that the
promulgation in 2022 of the new investment law and the publication of its
implementing regulations, the abolition in 2020 of the 51/49 rule for non-
strategic sectors, and the publication of the new hydrocarbons law in 2019 are
positive steps, but must tackle the ecosystem, including paralyzing
bureaucracy, with greater visibility in socio-economic policy.

Continued implementation of government structural reform programs, creating
greater openness to the private sector, improving the economy’s
competitiveness, and strengthening investment in human capital are all
essential to the flourishing and resilience of the Algerian economy.

## Historical trends

The total imports and exports on the eve of the French invasion (in 1830) did
not exceed £175,000. By 1850, the figures had reached £5,000,000; in 1868,
£12,000,000; in 1880, £17,000,000; and in 1890, £20,000,000. From this point
progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year. In 1905
the total value of the foreign trade was £24,500,000. About five-sixths of the
trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have
been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867. French goods, except
sugar, have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.
After the 1892 increase of the French minimum tariff which applied to Algeria
for the first time, foreign trade greatly diminished.[_citation needed_]

GDP per capita grew 40% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth of 538% in the
1970s. Growth collapsed to 9.7% in the turbulent 1980s. Failure of timely
reforms by successive governments caused the current GDP per capita to shrink
by 28% in the 1990s.

Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund in April 1994 and the
following year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended 30
April 1998. In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's
Soviet-era debt during a visit by President Vladimir Putin to the country, the
first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president Abdelaziz
Bouteflika agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defence
systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state
arms exporter Rosoboronexport.

Some progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings in 1995 and
1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth
since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget
deficit. Algeria's economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The
country's foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its
current level of $5 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999–2000 and the
government's tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade
surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the
country's finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the
floods of 10 November 2001 and an uncertain oil market made prospects for
2002-03 more problematic. The government has pledged to continue its efforts
to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside
the energy sector.

President Bouteflika has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if
implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy
remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has
continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic
investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing
high unemployment and improving living standards. Other priority areas include
banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government
bureaucracy.

The government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a
national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other
industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement
with the European Union. In June 1987, Algeria started accession negotiations
for entry into the World Trade Organization, but negotiations ceased in 2014.

In the 2000s the country enjoyed several years of strong economic performance,
with solid non-hydrocarbon growth, low inflation, an overall budget surplus
and a positive trade balance.

## Data

### GDP

In 2023 Algeria's nominal GDP is estimated to be US$224.10 billion. Using
purchasing power parity, estimated GDP was US$628.99 billion, or US$13,680 on
a per capita basis. The estimated real growth rate is 2.6%, down from 3.4% in
2022. In 2017 industry accounted for 39.3%% of GDP, services constituted
47.4%, and agriculture provided the remaining 13.3%.

After having virtually eliminated external debt before 2013, the drop
hydrocarbon prices and revenues has led to a large budget deficit which has
been only partly offset by spending cuts. Consequently, government debt has
increased to more than 30% of GDP. Inflation has remained at 3-6% on average
for 2013–17. However, the economy remains highly dependent on hydrocarbons,
which represent 89% of total exports; a continued slowdown of global energy
demand has significantly put pressure on Algeria's fiscal and external
positions.

### Government budget

In 2007, government revenues of US$58.5 billion exceeded expenditures of
US$41.4 billion. Receipts from the hydrocarbons industry usually account for
roughly 60% of revenues.

## Public and private sectors

Algeria's economy includes a significant public sector built up under a policy
of import substitution industrialization which remained intact after other
developing nations liberalised their economies under the influence of
structural adjustment programmes advocated by the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund towards the end of the 20th century. As of 2019,
this sector consisted of 400 publicly owned firms, and generates a third of
the state's revenue. Although economic liberalisation has advocates in
Algeria, in 2018 froze all plans to pursue privatisation.

In addition, the social safety net in Algeria is stronger than in other
countries in the region: it saw periods of expansion in the 1970s, and in the
2000s, helping to build stability after the Civil War. It is supplemented by
consumer subsidies. These measures allow for wages to be kept low.

The restrictive political economy in Algeria and continued adherence to the
ISI model has limited foreign direct investment in the country: Algeria has
one of the lowest levels of FDI in Africa. However, local businesses have
benefited from the state undertaking public works projects in the construction
of roads, ports, dams and housing. Both fixed capital formation and credit
extended to the private sector increased during the 2010s.

## Industries

### Agriculture and forestry

Algeria's agricultural sector, which contributes about 8 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) but employs 14 percent of the workforce, is unable to
meet the food needs of the country's population. As a result, some 45 percent
of food is imported. The primary crops are wheat, barley, and potatoes.
Farmers also have had success growing dates for export. Cultivation is
concentrated in the fertile coastal plain of the Tell region, which represents
just a slice of Algeria's total territory. Altogether, only about 3 percent of
Algerian territory is arable. Even in the Tell, rainfall variability has a
significant impact on production. Government efforts to stimulate farming in
the less arable steppe and desert regions have met with limited success.
However, herdsmen maintain livestock, specifically cow and sheep in the High
Plateaus region.

Algeria's climate and periodic wildfires are not conducive to a thriving
forestry industry. However, Algeria is a producer of cork and Aleppo pine. In
2005 roundwood removals totaled 7.8 million cubic meters, while sawnwood
production amounted to only 13 million cubic meters per year.

In 2018, Algeria produced:

  * 4.6 million tonnes of potato (17th largest producer in the world);
  * 3.9 million tonnes of wheat;
  * 2 million tons of watermelon (6th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.9 million tons of barley (18th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.4 million tons of onion (16th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.3 million tons of tomato (18th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.1 million tons of orange (14th largest producer in the world);
  * 1 million tons of date (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran);
  * 860 thousand tons of olives (6th largest producer in the world);
  * 651 thousand tons of pepper;
  * 502 thousand tons of grape;
  * 431 thousand tons of carrot;
  * 388 thousand tons of pumpkin;
  * 262 thousand tons of tangerine;
  * 242 thousand tons of apricot (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Turkey, Iran and Uzbekistan);
  * 207 thousand tons of cauliflower and broccoli;
  * 202 thousand tons of garlic;
  * 200 thousand tons of pear;
  * 193 thousand tons of cucumber;
  * 190 thousand tons of peach;
  * 186 thousand tons of pea;
  * 181 thousand tons of aubergine;
  * 124 thousand tons of artichoke (5th largest producer in the world, losing only to Italy, Egypt, Spain and Peru);
  * 118 thousand tons of oats;
  * 111 thousand tons of plum (20th largest producer in the world);
  * 109 thousand tons of fig (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Turkey, Egypt and Morocco);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

### Fishing

Algeria's fishing industry does not take full advantage of the Mediterranean
coast, in part because fishing is generally done from small family-owned boats
instead of large commercial fishing trawlers. However, the government is
attempting to boost the relatively small catch—slightly more than 125,000
metric tons in 2005—by modernizing fishing ports, permitting foreigners to
fish in Algerian waters, and subsidizing fishing-related projects.

Fishing is a flourishing but minor industry. Fish caught are principally
sardines, bonito, mackerel, smelt and sprats. Fresh fish are exported to
France, dried and preserved fish to Spain and Italy. Coral fisheries are found
along the coast from Bona to Tunis. The annual catch averages around 142,000
tons, 54% sardines.

### Minerals

Algeria is rich in minerals; the country has many iron, lead, zinc, copper,
calamine, antimony and mercury mines. The most productive are those of iron
and zinc. Lignite is found in Algiers; immense phosphate beds were discovered
near Tébessa in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905. Phosphate beds are also
worked near Sétif, Guelma and Aïn Beïda. There are more than 300 quarries
which produce, amongst other stones, onyx and white and red marbles. Algerian
onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have
been found near Sidi Ben Yebka, some being certainly those from which the
long-lost Numidian marbles were taken. Salt is collected on the margins of the
chotts.

In 2019, the country was the 17th largest world producer of gypsum, and the
19th largest world producer of phosphate.

### Banking and finance

Algeria's banking sector is dominated by public banks, which suffer from high
levels of non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of 2007,
public banks controlled 95 percent of total bank assets. In 2007 nonperforming
loans represented a towering 38 percent of total loans at public banks,
according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Modest progress has
been made in implementing several reforms proposed by the IMF, including
replacing bank credits to SOEs with government subsidies; boosting bank
supervision, accountability, and transparency; and modernizing the payments
system. One specific reform that has been achieved is the establishment in
2006 of the Algerian Real Time Settlements system, which facilitates the
prompt and reliable electronic transfer of payments. In November 2007, the
proposed sale and privatization of Crédit Populaire d’Algérie was postponed
because of turbulent market conditions. Recently, HSBC and Deutsche Bank
announced that they would commence commercial banking (in the case of HSBC)
and investment banking (in the case of Deutsche Bank) in Algeria. Only a few
companies are listed on the underdeveloped and relatively opaque Algiers stock
exchange. The non-bank sector remains less developed, although recent reforms
in the field of regulation and supervision have laid the foundations for
leasing, factoring, and venture capital.

The Algerian equity market remains relatively shallow, with only four
companies being listed in the Bourse d’Algerie. Conversely, the bond market
has expanded in recent years: the government has issued debt instruments with
varying maturities of up to fifteen years, and five private companies have
issued corporate bonds.

The insurance sector was liberalized in 1995, but is still dominated by
government-owned institutions and so far accounts only for a very small part
of the economy: total premium volume amounted to approximately 1 percent of
GDP. The pension sector encompasses three pension funds, which attained
coverage of approximately 40 percent of the working population in 2005.

Based on 2006 and 2007 estimates, 31 percent of the total population has
access to financial services, with one bank branch or post office every 7,250
inhabitants. The microfinance sector still has great potential for further
development. A 2006 study could not find major regulatory impediments to
microfinance and suggested that the geographical net of postal offices –
offering an increasing number of financial services to customers – holds a
high potential of increasing access to finance for the Algerian population.

Official remittance inflows increased steadily from US$1.9 to 2.9 billion
between 2005 and 2007.

### Tourism

Algeria's tourism industry, which contributes only about 1 percent of GDP,
lags behind that of its neighbors Morocco and Tunisia. Algeria receives only
about 200,000 tourists and visitors annually. Ethnic Algerian French citizens
represent the largest group of tourists, followed by Tunisians. The modest
level of tourism is attributable to a combination of poor hotel accommodations
and the threat of terrorism. However, the government has adopted a plan known
as “Horizon 2025,” which is designed to address these shortcomings. Various
hotel operators are planning to build hotels, particularly along the
Mediterranean coast. Another opportunity involves adventure holidays in the
Sahara (which comprises approximately 80% of the country's land area). In
addition to potential ecotourism, the country boasts many cultural and
historical sites, seven of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Algerian
government set the goal of boosting the number of foreign visitors, including
tourists, to 10 million by 2030.

### Other industries

Algeria has many diversified industries that contribute to meet local demands
and some times to exportation. The food industry is one of the largest
industrial sector in Algeria. Private companies generally dominate the food
sector in Algeria with large companies such as Cevital, La Belle, Groupe Bimo,
Hamoud Boualam, Ifri, Général Emballage.

The pharmaceutical industry is also present in Algeria, with the domination of
state-owned company Saidal, as well as other small private companies. The
local pharmaceutical industry covers 38% of local needs.

The mechanical industry has existed in Algeria for a long time, with the
state-owned company SNVI (Société Nationale des Véhicules Industriels) being
the largest producer of buses and industrial vehicles in the region. These
vehicles are exported to the Maghreb, Africa, and the Middle East. Mercedes-
Benz has also invested in Algeria in cooperation with a state-owned company to
produce industrial and military vehicles. Deutz AG also invested to produce
agricultural utilities.

In the electric and electronic industry, Algeria has made a great leap in the
field compared to its neighbours. The Algerian region Bordj-Bou-Arreridj is
the biggest electronic pole in Africa, local companies cover 83% of it needs
and export other products, Algeria started producing some 100% home made
electronic product including smartphones, tablets, TV, TV decoders, air
conditioning products ..., at least 16 big companies are active in the field,
some of the companies are : Bya Electronic, HB Technologies, ZALA Computer,
Cristor, Condor, Cobra, Continental électronique, Essalem Electronics, Samha,
FRIGOR, BMS Electric, Bomare Company, etc.

In December 2023 Italian carmaker Fiat has announced that it has opened its
first manufacturing plant in Tafraoui, Algeria.

## Currency, exchange rate, and inflation

Algeria's currency is the Algerian dinar (DZD). The dinar is loosely linked to
the U.S. dollar in a managed float. Algeria's main export, crude oil, is
priced in dollars, while most of Algeria's imports are priced in euros.
Therefore, the government endeavors to manage fluctuations in the value of the
dinar. As of April 2008, US$1 was equivalent to about DZD 64.6.

Algeria's foreign currency reserves have grown rapidly since 2000, reflecting
rising prices for exported oil. At the end of 2007, foreign reserves totaled
US$99.3 billion, up from US$12 billion in 2000 and the equivalent of almost
four years of imports. In 2007 the estimated inflation rate was 4.6 percent.

In 2010, the IMF voiced concerns about poor management of Algeria's monetary
system and inflation.

In April 2014, a report focusing on world economic projections was published
by the IMF, according to which it was predicted that, in 2015, Algeria's
economic growth would fall by 1.5%, while unemployment would rise by 1.2%.

## Labor

The largest employer is government, which claims 32 percent of the workforce.
Even though industry is a much larger part of the economy than agriculture,
agriculture employs slightly more people (14 percent of the workforce) than
industry (13.4 percent of the workforce). One of the reasons for this
disparity is that the energy sector is very capital-intensive. Trade accounts
for 14.6 percent of the workforce, while the construction and public works
sector employs 10 percent, reflecting the government's efforts to upgrade the
country's infrastructure and stock of affordable housing.

Unemployment has remained at levels around 10% since 2010 but is significantly
higher for youth (24.8%) and women (16.3%)

At the end of 2006, the unemployment rate was about 15.7 percent, but the rate
among those under the age of 25 was 70 percent. In 2005 the labor
participation rate was only 52 percent, versus an Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development average of 70 percent. New entrants to the
workforce and the lack of emigration options make unemployment a chronic
problem and an important challenge to the government. Given its highly
capital-intensive nature, the hydrocarbons industry is not in a position to
employ many job seekers.

## International trade and investment

Algeria is seeking more trade and foreign investment. For example, the
hydrocarbons law passed in April 2005 is designed to encourage foreign
investment in energy exploration. Increased production could raise Algeria's
profile as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In keeping with its pro-trade agenda, Algeria achieved association status with
the European Union (EU) in September 2005. Over a 12-year period, the
association agreement is expected to enable Algeria to export goods to the EU
tariff-free, while it gradually lifts tariffs on imports from the EU. Algeria
has signed bilateral investment agreements with 20 different nations,
including many European countries, China, Egypt, Malaysia, and Yemen. In July
2001, the United States and Algeria agreed on a framework for discussions
leading to such an agreement, but a final treaty has not yet been negotiated.
Ultimately, trade liberalization, customs modernization, deregulation, and
banking reform are designed to improve the country's negotiating position as
it seeks accession to the World Trade Organization.

In 2007 Algerian imports totaled US$26.08 billion. The principal imports were
capital goods, foodstuffs, and consumer goods. The top import partners were
France (22 percent), Italy (8.6 percent), China (8.5 percent), Germany (5.9
percent), Spain (5.9 percent), the United States (4.8 percent), and Turkey
(4.5 percent). In 2007 Algeria exported US$63.3 billion, more than twice as
much as it imported. Exports accounted for 30 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP). Hydrocarbon products constituted at least 95 percent of export
earnings. The principal exports were petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum
products. The top export partners were the United States (27.2 percent), Italy
(17 percent), Spain (9.7 percent), France (8.8 percent), Canada (8.1 percent),
and Belgium (4.3 percent). Algeria supplies 25 percent of the European Union's
natural gas imports. In 2007 Algeria posted a positive merchandise trade
balance of US$37.2 billion. In 2007 Algeria achieved a positive current
account balance of US$31.5 billion. High prices for Algeria's energy exports
are the main driver for the improvement in the current account balance.

Algeria's trade surplus for 2010 rose to over $83.14 billion. The Algerian
Centre for Information and Statistics Directorate of the Algerian Customs
attribute this increase from the previous year to higher fuel revenue due to
higher prices for a barrel of oil, and a slight decrease in imports of
consumer non-food materials. The center said that Algerian exports rose by
78.26% during the period from January to November 2010 from $27.51 billion to
$44.4 billion during the same period in 2009. Imports grew by 89.1% from
$43.36 billion to $76.35 billion between 2009 and 2010.

Reflecting strong oil export revenues, external debt is on a downward
trajectory. For example, these revenues facilitated early repayments of US$900
million in loans from the African Development Bank and Saudi Arabia. In March
2006, Algeria's purchase of 78 aircraft from Russia led to the cancellation of
Algeria's entire debt to Russia. In 2006 external debt was estimated at US$4.4
billion, down from US$23.5 billion in 2003.

In 2006 foreign direct investment (FDI) in Algeria totaled US$1.8 billion. The
petrochemical, transport, and utilities sectors have been recent beneficiaries
of FDI. FDI into the oil sector was expected to rise as a result of a
hydrocarbons law, approved in April 2005, that created a more even playing
field for foreign oil companies to compete with Algeria's state-owned oil
company, Sonatrach, for exploration and production contracts. Algeria also is
seeking foreign investment in power and water systems.

As of August 2006, cumulative World Bank assistance to Algeria totaled US$5.9
billion, encompassing 72 projects. Currently, the World Bank is pursuing seven
projects, specifically budget modernization, mortgage finance, natural
disaster recovery, energy and mining, rural employment, telecommunications,
and transportation. In 2005 economic assistance to Algeria from the United
States amounted to US$4.4 million, most of which was attributable to the
Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the remainder to International
Military Education and Training (IMET). MEPI encourages economic, political,
and educational reform in the Middle East. In 2006 IMET, which provides U.S.
military training to foreign troops, had a budget of US$823 million. In 2005
the European Union contributed US$58 million to Algeria's economic development
under the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
