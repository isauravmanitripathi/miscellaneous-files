The **economy of Ecuador** is the eighth largest in Latin America and the 69th
largest in the world by total GDP. Ecuador's economy is based on the export of
oil, bananas, shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money
transfers from Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad. In 2017, remittances
constituted 2.7% of Ecuador's GDP. The total trade amounted to 42% of the
Ecuador's GDP in 2017.

The country is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources. In 2017,
oil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 32% of export
earnings. When Ecuador was part of OPEC, it was one of the smallest members
and produced about 531,300 barrels per day of petroleum in 2017. It is the
world's largest exporter of bananas ($3.38 billion in 2017) and a major
exporter of shrimp ($3.06 billion in 2017). Exports of non-traditional
products such as cut flowers ($846 million in 2017) and canned fish ($1.18
billion in 2017) have grown in recent years.

In the past, Ecuador's economy depended largely on primary industries like
agriculture, petroleum, and aquaculture. As a result of shifts in global
market trends and development of technology, the country has experienced
economic development in other sectors, such as textiles, processed food,
metallurgy and the service sectors. Between 2006 and 2014, GDP growth averaged
4.3%, driven by high oil prices and external financing. From 2015 until 2018,
GDP growth averaged just 0.6%. Ecuador's ex-president, Lenín Moreno, launched
a radical transformation of Ecuador's economy after taking office in May 2017.
The aim was to increase the private sector's weight, in particular the oil
industry.

## Agriculture

Ecuador is one of the 10 largest producers in the world of banana, cocoa and
palm oil.

In 2018, the country produced 7.5 million tons of sugarcane, 6.5 million tons
of banana (6th largest producer in the world), 2.7 million tons of palm oil
(6th largest producer in the world), 1.3 million tons of maize, 1.3 million
tons of rice, 269 thousand tons of potato, 235 thousand tons of cocoa (7th
largest producer in the world), 149 thousand tons of pineapple, 103 thousand
tons of orange, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural
products. In more recent years, banana production has increased to around 7
million tons annually (7.16 million tons produced in 2023).

## Mining

In 2019, the country had an annual production of about 1 ton of antimony (14th
largest producer in the world).

In 2006, Ecuador had an annual production of about 5.3 tonnes of gold, being
the 34th largest producer in the world at the time. Ecuador produced 8.6 tons
of gold in 2013, which was the absolute record between 2006 and 2017. In 2017,
production was 7.3 tons.

In terms of silver production, Ecuador produced 1 ton in 2017, which is the
country's usual average.

In 2019, in the north of Ecuador, a large deposit of gold, silver and copper
was discovered.

## Industries

Oil accounts for 40% of exports and contributes to maintaining a positive
trade balance. Since the late '60s, the exploitation of oil increased
production and reserves are estimated at 4.036 million barrels

In the agricultural sector, Ecuador is a major exporter of bananas (the
largest exporter of bananas in the world), cut flowers, cacao, coffee, shrimp,
wood, and fish. It is also significant in shrimp production, sugar cane, rice,
cotton, corn, palm and coffee.[_citation needed_] The country's vast resources
include large amounts of timber across the country, like eucalyptus and
mangroves. Pines and cedars are planted in the region of the Sierra, walnuts
and rosemary, and balsa wood, on Guayas River Basin.[_citation needed_]

Ecuador's tobacco is prized in the cigar industry due to the prolonged cloud
cover and rich volcanic soil creating ideal growing conditions, especially for
shade tobacco and Ecuadorian Sumatra Tobacco cigar wrapper leaves; exports
topped $70M in 2018.

**Oil Industry in Ecuador** Ecuador's oil industry is a cornerstone of its
economy, contributing significantly to export earnings and government
revenues. As of 2023, the country holds approximately 8.3 billion barrels of
proven crude oil reserves . In 2022, crude oil accounted for about 27% of
Ecuador's total export value, with major export destinations including Latin
America, North America, and Asia.

The state-owned company Petroecuador plays a pivotal role in the oil sector,
often operating in partnership with private and foreign corporations . Recent
initiatives aim to boost oil production through foreign investments, with
plans to attract approximately $42 billion in the oil sector by 2029 .

However, oil extraction has raised environmental and social concerns,
particularly in the Amazon region. In 2023, a national referendum led to the
cessation of oil drilling in Block 43 within Yasuni National Park, a
biodiverse area home to Indigenous communities.

**Agricultural Sector in Ecuador** Agriculture remains a vital component of
Ecuador's economy, accounting for a significant portion of exports. The
country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, with exports valued at
approximately $2 billion . Other major agricultural exports include shrimp,
cacao, coffee, and cut flowers. In 2020, agricultural products represented
about 41.1% of Ecuador's total export.

Ecuador's diverse climate and fertile soil enable the cultivation of various
crops, including rice, sugar cane, cotton, corn, and palm. The country's
forestry resources, such as eucalyptus, mangroves, pine, cedar, and balsa
wood, also contribute to its export economy.

The industry is concentrated mainly in Guayaquil, the largest industrial
center, and in Quito, where in recent years the industry has grown
considerably. This city is also the largest business center of the country.
Industrial production is directed primarily to the domestic market.[_citation
needed_] Despite this, there is limited export of products produced or
processed industrially.[_citation needed_] These include canned foods, liquor,
jewelry, furniture, and more.[_citation needed_] Minor industrial activity is
also concentrated in Cuenca.

The dairy industry is represented by companies such as Tonicorp, which is
owned by the Coca Cola Company.

## Electricity

As of December 2022, the generation and transmission infrastructure of Ecuador
included:

  * total installed generation capacity of 8,864 megawatts (MW) that included 
    * 5,425 MW of renewable energy generation with 
      * about 5200 MW of hydropower (in Ecuador, considered as renewable);
  * National Interconnection System (SNI) that was able to use 7,472 MW of the total capacity above (including 4375 MW from renewable sources). The remaining 1,390 MW are not part of the countrywide grid;
  * National Transmission System (SNT) with line voltages 500 kilovolt (kV), 230 kV and 138 kV, 4,382 km of single-circuit lines and 2,462 km of double-circuit lines, including 
    * interconnection with Colombia (two 230 kV Jamondino-Pomasqui double-circuit lines and a 138 kV Tulcán-Panamericana single-circuit line);
    * interconnection with Peru (a 230 kV Machala-Zorritos double-circuit line).

Distribution is provided through distribution companies with total billing of
2 billion US dollars and electricity losses of 13.25%. As of December 2022,
they managed:

  * 370 substations with total capacity of 8,545 megavolt-amperes (MVA)
  * 67 sectioning substations;[_clarification needed_]
  * 5,730 km of subtransmission[_clarification needed_] lines;
  * 111,276 km of medium voltage lines;
  * 105,469 km of low voltage lines
  * 360,000 distribution transformers with a total capacity of 14,100 MVA;
  * 5.56 million electrical meters (coverage of 97.4%).

The peak demand on the SNI grid occurs in April (4,388 MW in 2022). The total
generation in 2022 was 33 terawatt-hours (TWh) with 87% delivered by SNI and
the rest by provider unincorporated into the grid. The breakdown by the power
source at the SNI was as follows:

  * hydroelectric 24.6 TWh (85.3%);
  * fossil fuel 3.8 TWh (13%);
  * biomass 0.35 TWh (1.2%);
  * solar photovoltaic, biogas, wind energy less than 1% combined.

The amount of reported unavailable generation capacity varied between 1,170
and 1,610 GW in 2019-2022, approximately evenly split between hydro and
thermal power stations. The plan of r2023-2032 called for major expansion of
the generation capacity, primarily renewable energy (additional 6,300 MW), but
with 700 MW of "firm" (thermal) capacity scheduled to come on-line in
2024-2025. This "firm" generation was intended for the electric grid security
and "quality of supply".

During the 2023-2024 Ecuador electricity crisis, in the fall of 2024, the
amount of thermal generation was significantly lower than the numbers above
would suggest. For example, according to Miguel Calahorrano, an ex-minister of
electricity and renewable energy, only Trinitaria (125 MW), Machala Gas (125
MW), G. Zevallos (146 MW) and Jaramijó (140 MW) were operating at high power
until October 15, 2024.

## Sciences and research

EXA's first satellite, NEE-01 Pegasus

Ecuador was placed in 96th position of innovation in technology in a 2013
World Economic Forum study. Ecuador was ranked 91st in the Global Innovation
Index in 2021 up from 99th in 2020. The most notable icons in Ecuadorian
sciences are the mathematician and cartographer Pedro Vicente Maldonado, born
in Riobamba in 1707, and the printer, independence pioneer, and medical
pioneer Eugenio Espejo, born in 1747 in Quito. Among other notable Ecuadorian
scientists and engineers are Lieutenant Jose Rodriguez Labandera, who built
the first submarine in Latin America in 1837; Reinaldo Espinosa Aguilar
(1898–1950), a botanist and biologist of Andean flora; and José Aurelio Dueñas
(1880–1961), a chemist and inventor of a method of textile serigraphy, reputed
to have many wives.

The major areas of scientific research in Ecuador have been in the medical
fields, tropical and infectious diseases treatments, agricultural engineering,
pharmaceutical research, and bioengineering. Being a small country and a
consumer of foreign technology, Ecuador has favored research supported by
entrepreneurship in information technology. The antivirus program
_Checkprogram_ , banking protection system _MdLock_ , and Core Banking
Software _Cobis_ are products of Ecuadorian development.

The scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of
funding but focused around physics, statistics, and partial differential
equations in mathematics.[_citation needed_] In the case of engineering
fields, the majority of scientific production comes from the top three
polytechnic institutions: Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral – _ESPOL_ ,
Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas – _ESPE_ , and Escuela Politécnica Nacional
_EPN_. The Center for Research and Technology Development in Ecuador is an
autonomous center for research and technology development funded by Senecyt.

However, according to _Nature_ , the multidisciplinary scientific journal, the
top 10 institutions that carry the most outstanding scientific contributions
are: Yachay Tech University (_Yachay Tech_), Escuela Politécnica Nacional
(_EPN)_, and Universidad San Francisco de Quito _(USFQ)_.

## Trade

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to

---|---  
  
The overall trade balance for August 2012 was a surplus of almost 390 million
dollars for the first six months of 2012, a huge figure compared with that of
2007, which reached only $5.7 million; the surplus had risen by about 425
million compared to 2006. This circumstance was due to the fact that imports
grew faster than exports. The oil trade balance positive had revenues of
$3.295 million in 2008, while non-oil was negative amounting to 2.842 million
dollars.[_citation needed_]. The trade balance was positive in 2019 and 2020
with 2.05 billion dollars and 6.4 billion dollars. In 2016, the trade balance
was positive (608 million dollars) but negative in 2017 (-723 million dollars)
and 2018 (1.41 billion dollars). The trade balance with Argentina, Colombia
and Asia is negative.

Ecuador has negotiated bilateral treaties with other countries, besides
belonging to the Andean Community of Nations, and an associate member of
Mercosur. It also belongs to the World Trade Organization (WTO), in addition
to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), World Bank, International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF)
and other multilateral agencies. In April 2007, Ecuador paid off its debt to
the IMF thus ending an era of interventionism of the Agency in the country.
The public finance of Ecuador consists of the Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE),
the National Development Bank (BNF), the State Bank, the National Finance
Corporation, the Ecuadorian Housing Bank (BEV) and the Ecuadorian Educational
Loans and Grants.

## Economic history

Deteriorating economic performance in 1997–98 culminated in a severe financial
crisis in 1999. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks,
including the El Niño weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global oil
prices in 1997–98, and international emerging market instability in 1997–98.
These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic
policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted
in a 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a
65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999.

On January 9, 2000, the administration of President Jamil Mahuad announced its
intention to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency of Ecuador to
address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the 2000
Ecuadorean coup d'état which saw Mahuad's removal from office and the
elevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency.

US Dollar has been the only official currency of Ecuador since the year 2000.

The Noboa government confirmed its commitment to convert to the dollar as the
centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy, successfully completing the
transition from sucres to dollars in 2001. Following the completion of a one-
year stand-by program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December
2001, Ecuador successfully negotiated a new $205 million stand-by agreement
with the IMF in March 2003.

Buoyed by higher oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest
recovery in 2000–01, with GDP rising 2.3% in 2000 and 5.4% in 2001. GDP growth
leveled off to 2.7% in 2002. Inflation fell from an annual rate of 96.1% in
2000 to an annual rate of 37.7% in 2001; 12.6% for 2002.

The completion of the second Transandean Oil Pipeline (OCP in Spanish) in 2003
enabled Ecuador to expand oil exports. The OCP will double Ecuador's oil
transport capacity.

Ecuador's economy is the eighth largest in Latin America and experienced an
average growth of 4.6% per year between 2000 and 2006. In January 2009, the
Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) put the 2010 growth forecast at 6.88%. GDP
doubled between 1999 and 2007, reaching 65,490 million dollars according to
BCE. Inflation rate up to January 2008 was located about 1.14%, the highest
recorded in the last year, according to Government. The monthly unemployment
rate remained at about 6 and 8 percent from December 2007 until September
2008, however, it went up to about 9 percent in October and dropped again in
November 2008 to 8 percent.

Between 2006 and 2009, the government increased spending on social welfare and
education from 2.6% to 5.2% of its GDP. Starting in 2007, when its economy was
surpassed by the economic crisis, Ecuador was subject to a number of economic
policy reforms by the government that have helped steer the Ecuadorian economy
to a sustained, substantial, and focused achievement of financial stability
and consistent social policy. [_vague_] Such policies were expansionary fiscal
policies, of access to housing finance, stimulus packs, and limiting the
amount of money reserves banks could keep abroad. The Ecuadorian government
has made huge investments in education and infrastructure throughout the
nation, which have improved the lives of the poor.

On December 12, 2008, President Rafael Correa announced that Ecuador would not
pay $30.6m in interest to lenders of a $510m loan, claiming that they were
monsters. In addition it claimed that $3.8bn in foreign debt negotiated by
previous administrations was illegitimate because it was authorized without
executive decree. At the time of the announcement, the country had $5.65bn in
cash reserves.

In 2009, economic growth declined to 0.6% during the global recession,
accompanied by falling oil prices and a decline in remittances provided by
Ecuadorians living and working abroad (a major source of external revenues).
Showing signs of recovery in 2010, the economy rebounded and grew by 2.8%.
After growth of 7.4% in 2011, Ecuador's growth averaged 4.5% from 2012 to
2014.

Some observers have attributed the high growth to a public investment boom
that was fueled by high oil prices and lending from China. According to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration, Ecuador was the third largest source
of foreign oil to the western United States in 2014. However, in the middle of
2014 after the price of oil declined significantly, Ecuador's oil earnings
fell. As a consequence, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecast that
Ecuador's economy would contract slightly in 2015, although the economy
ultimately grew by less than half a percent. President Correa's plans to begin
extracting crude oil from the Ishpingo, Tambochoa, and Tiputini field in
Yasuní National Park in the Amazon to provide an economic boost did not
salvage the economy from going into recession. In 2016, Ecuador's gross
domestic product contracted by 1.6%.

Ecuador's economic slowdown in 2016 and the country's need for external
finance were exacerbated by a deadly April 2016 earthquake. Ecuador's
estimated $3 billion costs for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance for
720,000 people in the affected region remain a burden that the government and
private sector have sought to address. In response, the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance provided more than $3 million in assistance, including
provisions airlifted in for 50,000 people in the earthquake-prone region and
assistance with water and sanitation systems in affected areas. A U.N. appeal
by the Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance sought to raise $73
million. However, as of July 2016, only one-fifth of this amount had been
received from donor countries, including the United States.

The Correa government increased a value-added tax and implemented a plan to
further cut government expenditures after cutting capital expenditures by 30%.
Despite President Correa's reluctance to ask for assistance from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the IMF approved a request for $364 million
in financial support under its Rapid Financing Instrument in early July 2016
for Ecuador. Additional loans from China and the World Bank to help ease the
government's balance-of-payments needs were considered.

Ecuador's access to global financial markets also had been limited by its 2008
default on $3.2 billion in debt to global lenders. Consequently, the Correa
government turned to nontraditional allies, such as China, for external
finance. From 2005 to 2014, Chinese banks provided almost $11 billion of
financing to Ecuador. The Correa government also asked China for an additional
$7.5 billion in financing in early 2015 as crude oil prices—the nation's
biggest export—weakened further. China agreed to the financing request and
began to disburse funding, including nearly $1 billion in May and June 2015.
Ecuador successfully returned to the international capital market in June 2014
with a $2 billion bond issue followed by additional smaller bond issues in
2015. President Moreno later discovered loans made by China over the years
currently require that Ecuador pay China back with almost 500 barrels of crude
oil—or roughly three years of the country's oil production. According to press
reports, some private sector analysts question whether Ecuador will be able to
meet its debt obligations given two strains on the country's public finances:
the slump in oil income due to the commodity's low price and the strong U.S.
dollar, which, as a result of Ecuador's dollarized economy, makes the
country's exports less globally competitive.

Ecuador withdrew from efforts to develop a regional free trade agreement (FTA)
between the United States and Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in 2006.
The United States subsequently signed bilateral FTAs with Peru and Colombia,
but Ecuador showed no interest in pursuing an FTA with the United States.
Following Venezuela's acceptance in 2012 to full membership in the South
American customs union, Mercosur (Mercado Común del Sur or Common Market of
the South), the leftist governments in Bolivia and Ecuador applied to move
from observer status to full membership in the trade bloc originally composed
of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. According to some observers, out
of a concern for Ecuador's struggling non-oil exporters, Correa embraced a
trade agreement with the European Union (EU) as part of the EU-Andean
Community Association agreement that went into effect in January 2017.

The International Monetary Fund approved an agreement with Ecuador in March
2019. This arrangement would provide support ($10 billion) for the Ecuadorian
government's economic policies over three years (2018–2021 Prosperity Plan).

## Poverty and inequality

As of 2012[update], an estimated 9 million Ecuadorians have an economic
occupation and about 1.01 million inhabitants are in unemployment condition.
In 1998, 10% of the richest population had 42.5% of income, while 10% of the
poor had only 0.6% of income. The rates of poverty were higher for populations
of indigenous, afro-descendents, and rural sectors. During the same year, 7.6%
of health spending went to the 20% of the poor, while 20% of the rich
population received 38.1% of this expenditure. The extreme poverty rate has
declined significantly between 1999 and 2010. In 2001 it was estimated at 40%
of the population, while by 2011 the figure dropped to 17.4% of the total
population. This is explained largely by emigration and economic stability
achieved after adopting the U.S. dollar as official means of transaction .
Poverty rates were higher for indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and rural
areas, reaching 44% of the Native ancestry population.

## Infrastructure development

The industrial sector has had enormous difficulty to emerge significantly. The
industrial sector's main problem is the deficit of energy, which the current
government has tackled with the improvement of performance on existing hydro
plants, and the creation of new ones. Such projects included negotiation of
the Coca-Codo hydroplant. Incentives of financing, tributary incentives,
tariffs, and others will be implemented, that is intended to benefit areas of
tourism, food processing, renewable and alternative energy sources,
bioenergies, pharmaceutical and chemical products, biochemical and
environmental biomedecine, services, automotive metallurgical industry,
footwear, and automotive parts and pieces, among others. A 500 kV transmission
line increases national grid strength and electricity trade with Peru and
Colombia.
