The labour productivity level of Luxembourg is one of the highest in Europe.
OECD, 2012.

The **economy ofLuxembourg** is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and
industrial sectors. Citizens of Luxembourg enjoy the highest per capita gross
domestic product in the world, according to an IMF estimate in 2022. Among
OECD nations, Luxembourg has a highly efficient and strong social security
system; social welfare expenditure stood at roughly 21.9% of GDP.

Prior to the mid-19th century, Luxembourg was primarily rural and mostly
isolated from commerce with neighboring economies. In the late 19th century,
Luxembourg's dominant sector was steel industry. Over time, the main economic
sector became finance. Due to its reputation for secrecy, it has become an
attractive location for individuals and businesses to hold assets for tax
avoidance and tax evasion purposes.

## History

From 1715 to 1791, Luxembourg was under Austro-Hungarian rule. At the time, it
was predominantly rural. It has been described as largely isolated. It had no
road connections to Brussels, which limited its ability to trade with
neighbors. Towards the end of the 18th century, long-distance paved roads were
constructed, which integrated Luxembourg with neighboring markets.

The first land survey in Luxembourg was conducted after a decree by Maria-
Theresa in 1766. The land survey was part of a broader reform effort to
abolish certain feudal privileges and encourage more egalitarianism.

Full abolition of feudalism in Luxembourg took place in 1795 when Luxembourg
was made part of the French revolutionary regime. It was part of Napoleonic
France until 1815 when the Congress of Vienna gave the Eastern part of
Luxembourg to Prussia while the remainder formed the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
under Dutch rule. Under Dutch rule, new taxes and customs tariffs were
introduced, which harmed commerce in Luxembourg and contributed to it
remaining a rural country.

The 1839 Treaty of London divided part of Luxembourg into a province of newly
independent Belgium while the remainder became the independent Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg. During the first half of the 19th century, Luxembourg remained
rural, although there was an emergence of a textile industry. In the second
half of the 19th century, Luxembourg developed a steel industry, which would
become the dominant sector.

## Sectors

In 2013 the GDP was $60.54 billion of which services, including the financial
sector, produced 86%. The financial sector comprised 36% of GDP, industry
comprised 13.3% and agriculture only 0.3%.

### The financial center

#### Banking

Luxembourg has been part of the eurozone since 1999.

Banking is the largest sector in the Luxembourg economy. In the 2019 Global
Financial Centres Index, Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most
competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in
Europe after London and Zürich. The country has specialised in the cross-
border fund administration business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is
relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly
international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg,
with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy
access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of
banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to
the growth of the financial sector. These factors have contributed to a
Corruption Perceptions Index of 8.3 and a DAW Index ranking of 10 in 2012; the
latter the highest in Europe. Germany accounts for the largest-single grouping
of banks, with Scandinavian, Japanese, and major US banks also heavily
represented. Total assets exceeded €929 billion at the end of 2008. More than
9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg. The European Investment
Bank—the financial institution of the European Union—is also located there.

Luxembourg enterprises expected negative investment in 2023 due to slowing
economic growth and tighter monetary policy. The net balance of enterprises
anticipating an increase in investment minus those expecting a fall is
negative at -4%, far lower than the EU average of 14%.

#### Holdings

Since the Holding Act of 1929, Luxembourg has been an attractive location for
tax avoidance. A network of lawyers, bankers and political elites have since
then maintained an infrastructure of regulatory codes, legal expertise and
shell companies that enable tax avoidance. Concern about Luxembourg's banking
secrecy laws, and its reputation as a tax haven, led in April 2009 to it being
added to a "grey list" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by
the G20, a list from which it was removed in 2009. This concern has led
Luxembourg to modify its tax legislation to avoid conflict with the tax
authorities of European Union Members. For example, the classic tax exempt
1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an
illegal state aid by the European Commission.

Nearly 90 percent of companies operating in Luxembourg are foreign.
Approximately 40 percent of Luxembourg companies do not engage in any
meaningful economic activity in Luxembourg: they just hold assets in
Luxembourg.

##### The early beginnings of the financial center

Contrary to the belief of a large number of national historians, the financial
center of Luxembourg was not a product that simply saw success out of nowhere
in the 70s. In their article, Calabrese and Majerus argue that the Holding Law
of 1929 (H29) was more than just a historical side note, but rather a
foundation that laid the future of the country’s financial success. In essence
the law was a legal tool that would help companies in avoiding double taxation
on financial assets, mainly by creating a dummy corporations and profiting
from the low taxes the country offered for these kinds of companies. The newly
introduced Holding regime was successful. Within a span of three years, the
capital estimations for the holding companies not only met but exceeded
expectations, reaching a total surpassing 2 billion Luxembourg francs. Among
the biggest holdings was The Ford Investment Company set up in early 1930. The
Holding, enabled by the legislation, could avoid UK tax on the dividends of
its subsidiary companies in Europe. This type of company could however, also
be used to loan money or make investments, like in the case of Ford by buying
factories for European subsidiaries for example. The Law was accompanied by
the creation of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange a year earlier, which would
constitute another important institution to round off the construction of a
national financial center. In the interwar period, the role these Holding
companies played as a source of revenue started to materialize. While the
discussions on the adoption of the Holding Law saw opposition members argue
against it, discussions on later modifications on the Law would not see a
strong opposition anymore due to its contribution to the state’s tax revenues.

H29 also enabled the creation of networks and practices. Following its
implementation, Luxembourg experienced the establishment of a network
involving lawyers, banks, and notaries closely associated with the local
political elite. This network successfully developed and maintained an
infrastructure comprising regulatory codes, legal expertise, and shell
companies, rendering it appealing within the European market for tax
avoidance. Additionally, H29 majorly contributed to the establishment of a
legal framework that would pave the way for the future use of investment
funds, by establishing a positive reputation among investors and proving
itself to be a competent key-player on the market. As a result, Luxembourg was
chosen in 1963 to list the first and a large part of the Eurobonds on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a choice that only could have been made with the
awareness of a financial center that could keep up with others such as London,
which were also used in the case of Eurobonds.

Consequently, the Holding Law of 1929 had a large and long lasting impact on
the construction of a domestic financial place, an impact that should not be
disregarded when presenting the economic history of the country.

### Steel

A key event in the economic history of Luxembourg was the 1876 introduction of
English metallurgy[_citation needed_]. The refining process led to the
development of the steel industry in Luxembourg and founding of the Arbed
company in 1911.

The restructuring of the industry and increasing government ownership in ARBED
(31%) began as early as 1974.

In 2001, Arbed merged with Aceralia and Usinor to form Arcelor, which, in
2007, merged with Mittal Steel Company to form ArcelorMittal.

### Telecommunications

Government policies promote the development of Luxembourg as an audiovisual
and communications center. Radio-Television-Luxembourg is Europe's premier
private radio and television broadcaster. The government-backed Luxembourg
satellite company SES (formerly Société Européenne des Satellites) was created
in 1986 to install and operate a satellite telecommunications system for
transmission of television programs throughout Europe. The first SES Astra
satellite, the 16-channel RCA 4000 Astra 1A, was launched by the Ariane Rocket
in December 1988. SES presently [when?] constitutes the world largest
satellite services company in terms of revenue.

67% of Luxembourg enterprises use innovative digital technologies. Luxembourg
firms choose robots (74%), IoT (43%), and digital platforms (42%), over other
digital technologies.

### Tourism

Tourism is an important component of the national economy, representing about
8.3% of GDP in 2009 and employing some 25,000 people or 11.7% of the working
population. Despite the current crisis, the Grand Duchy still welcomes over
900,000 visitors a year who spend an average of 2.5 nights in hotels, hostels
or on camping sites. Business travel is flourishing representing 44% of
overnight stays in the country and 60% in the capital, up 11% and 25% between
2009 and 2010.

### Agriculture

Luxembourg's small but productive agricultural sector is highly subsidized,
mainly by the EU and the government. It employs about 1–3% of the workforce.
Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. Vineyards in the
Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine,
most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and
Belgium on a lesser scale.[_citation needed_]

## Data

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in
Luxembourg is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 89,748 companies
followed by Services and Retail Trade with 31,658 and 6,571 companies
respectively.

## Energy

In 1978, Luxembourg tried to build a 1,200 MW nuclear reactor but dropped the
plans after threats of major protests. Luxembourg uses imported oil and
natural gas for the majority of its energy generation.

## Spaceflight and space resource extraction

Luxembourg is a member of the European Space Agency where Luxembourg
contributed 23 million Euros in 2015.

The world's biggest satellite operator (SES) has its origin and headquarters
in Betzdorf, Luxembourg.

In February 2016, the Government of Luxembourg announced that it would attempt
to "jump-start an industrial sector to mine asteroid resources in space" by,
among other things, creating a "legal framework" and regulatory incentives for
companies involved in the industry. By June 2016, announced that it would
"invest more than US$200 million in research, technology demonstration, and in
the direct purchase of equity in companies relocating to Luxembourg." By April
2017, three space mining corporations had established headquarters in
Luxembourg.

Luxembourg's new law took effect in August 2017, ensuring that private
operators can be confident about their rights on resources they extract in
space. The law provides that space resources can be owned by anyone, not just
by Luxembourg citizens or companies."

## Transportation

Luxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services.
The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147 km
of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the
high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway
station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been
opened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during
the last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020 : 4 mio expected), and the second stage of
expansion is on its way.

Trams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end
2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-
Alzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both
residents and visitors.
