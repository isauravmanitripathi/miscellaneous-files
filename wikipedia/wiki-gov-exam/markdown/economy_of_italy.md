The **economy of Italy** is a highly developed social market economy. It is
the third-largest national economy in the European Union, the 8th-largest
economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the 11th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.
The country has the second-largest manufacturing industry in Europe, which is
also the 7th-largest in the world. Italy has a diversified economy which is
dominated by the tertiary service sector. The country is a great power, and is
a founding member of the European Union, the eurozone, the Schengen Area, the
OECD, the G7 and the G20; it is the eighth-largest exporter in the world, with
$611 billion exported in 2021. Its closest trade ties are with the other
countries of the European Union, with whom it conducts about 59% of its total
trade. Its largest trading partners are Germany (12.5%) and France (10.3%),
followed by the United States (9%), Spain (5.2%), the United Kingdom (5.2%)
and Switzerland (4.6%).

In the post-World War II period, Italy saw a transformation from an
agricultural-based economy which had been severely affected by the
consequences of the World Wars, into one of the world's most advanced nations,
and a leading country in world trade and exports. According to the Human
Development Index, the country enjoys a very high standard of living.
According to _The Economist_ , Italy has the world's 8th highest quality of
life. Italy owns the world's third-largest gold reserve, and is the third-
largest net contributor to the budget of the European Union. Furthermore, the
advanced country private wealth is one of the largest in the world. In terms
of private wealth, Italy ranks second, after Hong Kong, in private wealth to
GDP ratio. Among OECD members, Italy has a highly efficient and strong social
security system, which comprises roughly 24.4% of GDP.

Italy is the world's seventh-largest manufacturing country, characterised by a
smaller number of global multinational corporations than other economies of
comparable size and many dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises,
notoriously clustered in several industrial districts, which are the backbone
of the Italian economy. Italy is a large manufacturer and exporter of a
significant variety of products. Its products include machinery, vehicles,
pharmaceuticals, furniture, food and clothing. Italy has a significant trade
surplus. The country is also well known for its influential and innovative
business economic sector, an industrious and competitive agricultural sector
(Italy is the world's largest wine producer), and manufacturers of creatively
designed, high-quality products: including automobiles, ships, home
appliances, and designer clothing. Italy is the largest hub for luxury goods
in Europe and the third-largest luxury hub globally. Italy has a strong
cooperative sector, with the largest share of the population (4.5%) employed
by a cooperative in the EU.

Despite these important achievements, the country's economy today suffers from
few structural and non-structural problems. Annual growth rates have often
been below the EU average. Italy was somewhat hit by the late-2000s recession.
Massive government spending from the 1980s onwards has produced a severe rise
in public debt. In addition, Italian living standards are extremely high on
average, but have a considerable North–South divide: the average GDP per
capita in the much richer Northern Italy significantly exceeds the EU average,
while some regions and provinces in Southern Italy are significantly below the
average. In Central Italy, GDP per capita is instead average. In recent years,
Italy's GDP per capita growth slowly caught-up with the eurozone average,
while its employment rate also did. However, economists dispute the official
figures because of the large number of informal jobs (estimated to be between
10% and 20% of the labour force) that lift the inactivity or unemployment
rates. The shadow economy is highly represented in Southern Italy, while it
becomes less intense as one moves north. In real economic conditions, Southern
Italy almost matches Central Italy's level.

## History

The Barsanti-Matteucci engine, the first proper internal combustion engine

The Italian Renaissance was remarkable in economic development. Venice and
Genoa were the trade pioneers, first as maritime republics and then as
regional states, followed by Milan, Florence, and the rest of northern Italy.
Reasons for their early development are for example the relative military
safety of Venetian lagoons, the high population density and the institutional
structure which inspired entrepreneurs. The Republic of Venice was the first
real international financial center, which slowly emerged from the 9th century
to its peak in the 15th century. Tradeable bonds as a commonly used type of
security, were invented by the Italian city-states (such as Venice and Genoa)
of the late medieval and early Renaissance periods.

After 1600 Italy experienced an economic catastrophe. In 1600 Northern and
Central Italy comprised one of the most advanced industrial areas of Europe.
There was an exceptionally high standard of living. By 1870 Italy was an
economically backward and depressed area; its industrial structure had almost
collapsed, its population was too high for its resources, its economy had
become primarily agricultural. Wars, political fractionalization, limited
fiscal capacity and the shift of world trade to north-western Europe and the
Americas were key factors.

The economic history of Italy after 1861 can be divided in three main phases:
an initial period of struggle after the unification of the country,
characterised by high emigration and stagnant growth; a central period of
robust catch-up from the 1890s to the 1980s, interrupted by the Great
Depression of the 1930s and the two world wars; and a final period of sluggish
growth that has been exacerbated by a double-dip recession following the 2008
global financial crush, and from which the country is slowly reemerging only
in recent years.

### Age of Industrialization

Prior to unification, the economy of the many Italian statelets was
overwhelmingly agrarian; however, the agricultural surplus produced what
historians call a "pre-industrial" transformation in North-western Italy
starting from the 1820s, that led to a diffuse, if mostly artisanal,
concentration of manufacturing activities, especially in Piedmont-Sardinia
under the liberal rule of the Count of Cavour.

light bulb

After the birth of the unified Kingdom of Italy in 1861, there was a deep
consciousness in the ruling class of the new country's backwardness, given
that the per capita GDP expressed in PPS terms was roughly half of that of
Britain and about 25% less than that of France and Germany. During the 1860s
and 1870s, the manufacturing activity was backward and small-scale, while the
oversized agrarian sector was the backbone of the national economy. The
country lacked large coal and iron deposits and the population was largely
illiterate. In the 1880s, a severe farm crisis led to the introduction of more
modern farming techniques in the Po valley, while from 1878 to 1887
protectionist policies were introduced with the aim to establish a heavy
industry base. Some large steel and iron works soon clustered around areas of
high hydropower potential, notably the Alpine foothills and Umbria in central
Italy, while Turin and Milan led a textile, chemical, engineering and banking
boom and Genoa captured civil and military shipbuilding.

However, the diffusion of industrialisation that characterised the
northwestern area of the country largely excluded Venetia and, especially, the
South. The resulting Italian diaspora concerned up to 26 million Italians, the
most part in the years between 1880 and 1914; by many scholars, it is
considered the biggest mass migration of contemporary times. During the Great
War, the still frail Italian state successfully fought a modern war, being
able of arming and training some 5 million recruits. But this result came at a
terrible cost: by the end of the war, Italy had lost 700,000 soldiers and had
a ballooning sovereign debt amounting to billions of lira.

### Fascist regime

Benito Mussolini giving a speech at the Fiat Lingotto factory in Turin, 1932

Italy emerged from World War I in a poor and weakened condition. The National
Fascist Party of Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922, at the end of a
period of social unrest. However, once Mussolini acquired a firmer hold of
power, laissez-faire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of
government intervention and protectionism.

In 1929, Italy was hit hard by the Great Depression. In order to deal with the
crisis, the Fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which
had accrued significant industrial securities, establishing the Istituto per
la Ricostruzione Industriale. A number of mixed entities were formed, whose
purpose was to bring together representatives of the government and of the
major businesses. These representatives discussed economic policy and
manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the
government and the wishes of business.

This economic model based on a partnership between government and business was
soon extended to the political sphere, in what came to be known as
corporatism. At the same time, the aggressive foreign policy of Mussolini led
to increasing military expenditure. After the invasion of Ethiopia, Italy
intervened to support Franco's nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. By 1939,
Italy had the highest percentage of state-owned enterprises after the Soviet
Union.

Italy's involvement in World War II as a member of the Axis powers required
the establishment of a war economy. The Allied invasion of Italy in 1943
eventually caused the Italian political structure – and the economy – to
rapidly collapse. The Allies, on the one hand, and the Germans on the other,
took over the administration of the areas of Italy under their control. By the
end of the war, Italian per capita income was at its lowest point since the
beginning of the 20th century.

### Post-war economic miracle

The Fiat 500, launched in 1957, is considered a symbol of Italy's postwar
economic miracle. Programma 101, developed in 1965 by Olivetti is considered
one of the first programmable calculators ever and was an economic success
internationally.

After the end of World War II, Italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign
armies, a condition that worsened the chronic development gap among the more
advanced European economies. However, the new geopolitical logic of the Cold
War made possible that the former enemy Italy, a hinge country between Western
Europe and the Mediterranean, and now a new, fragile democracy threatened by
the NATO occupation forces, the proximity of the Iron Curtain and the presence
of a strong Communist party, was considered by the United States as an
important ally for the Free World, and received under the Marshall Plan over
US$1.2 billion from 1947 to 1951.

The end of aid through the Plan could have stopped the recovery but it
coincided with a crucial point in the Korean War whose demand for metal and
manufactured products was a further stimulus of Italian industrial production.
In addition, the creation in 1957 of the European Common Market, with Italy as
a founding member, provided more investment and eased exports.

These favourable developments, combined with the presence of a large labour
force, laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost
uninterrupted until the "Hot Autumn's" massive strikes and social unrest of
1969–70, which then combined with the later 1973 oil crisis and put an abrupt
end to the prolonged boom. It has been calculated that the Italian economy
experienced an average rate of growth of GDP of 5.8% per year between 1951 and
1963, and 5% per year between 1964 and 1973. Italian rates of growth were
second only, but very close, to the West German rates, in Europe, and among
the OEEC countries only Japan had been doing better.

### The 1970s and 1980s: from stagflation to "il sorpasso"

Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti (far left) with G7 leaders in Bonn, 1978

The 1970s were a period of economic, political turmoil and social unrest in
Italy, known as Years of lead. Unemployment rose sharply, especially among the
young, and by 1977 there were one million unemployed people under the age of
24. Inflation continued, aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in
1973 and 1979. The budget deficit became permanent and intractable, averaging
about 10 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), higher than any other
industrial country. The lira fell steadily, from Lire 560 to the U.S. dollar
in 1973 to Lire 1,400 in 1982.

The economic recession went on into the mid-1980s until a set of reforms led
to the independence of the Bank of Italy and a big reduction of the indexation
of wages that strongly reduced inflation rates, from 20.6% in 1980 to 4.7% in
1987. The new macroeconomic and political stability resulted in a second,
export-led "economic miracle", based on small and medium-sized enterprises,
producing clothing, leather products, shoes, furniture, textiles, jewellery,
and machine tools. As a result of this rapid expansion, in 1987 Italy overtook
the UK's economy (an event known as _il sorpasso_), becoming the fourth
richest nation in the world, after the US, Japan and West Germany. The Milan
stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than fivefold in the
space of a few years.

However, the Italian economy of the 1980s presented a problem: it was booming,
thanks to increased productivity and surging exports, but unsustainable fiscal
deficits drove the growth. In the 1990s, the new Maastricht criteria boosted
the urge to curb the public debt, already at 104% of GDP in 1992. The
consequent restrictive economic policies worsened the impact of the global
recession already underway. After a brief recovery at the end of the 1990s,
high tax rates and red tape caused the country to stagnate between 2000 and
2008.

Italy was among the countries hit hardest by the Great Recession of 2008–2009
and the subsequent European debt crisis. The national economy shrunk by 6.76%
during the whole period, totaling seven-quarters of recession. In November
2011 the Italian bond yield was 6.74 per cent for 10-year bonds, nearing a 7
per cent level where Italy is thought to lose access to financial markets.
According to Eurostat, in 2015 the Italian government debt stood at 128% of
GDP, ranking as the second biggest debt ratio after Greece (with 175%).
However, the biggest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by Italian
nationals and relatively high levels of private savings and low levels of
private indebtedness are seen as making it the safest among Europe's
struggling economies. As a shock therapy to avoid the debt crisis and kick-
start growth, the national unity government led by the economist Mario Monti
launched a program of massive austerity measures, that brought down the
deficit but precipitated the country in a double-dip recession in 2012 and
2013, receiving criticism from numerous economists.

### Economic recovery

In the period 2014-2019, the economy partially recovered from the disastrous
losses incurred during the Great Recession, primarily thanks to strong
exports, but nonetheless, growth rates remained well below the Euro area
average, meaning that Italy's GDP in 2019 was still 5 per cent below its level
in 2008.

#### Economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021)

Starting from February 2020, Italy was the first country of Europe to be
severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, that eventually expanded to the
rest of the world. The economy suffered a massive shock as a result of the
lockdown of most of the country's economic activity. After three months, at
the end of May 2020, the pandemic was put under control, and the economy
started to recover, especially, the manufacturing sector. Overall, it remained
surprisingly resilient, although GDP plummeted like in most western countries.
The Italian government issued special treasury bills, known as BTP Futura as a
COVID-19 emergency funding, waiting for the approval of the E.U. response to
the outbreak. Eventually, in July 2020, the European Council approved the 750
billion € Next Generation EU fund, of which €209 billion will go to Italy.

### Economic resilience

The Ferrari Portofino represents the synergy of "Made in Italy" brands that
strengthens the Italian economy.

Beginning in 2022, after the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy restarted with a
resilient economy which nonetheless had to face the global energy crisis of
2021-2023, involving an increase in gas and other energy prices due to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. This crisis created the need
to find an alternative supplier to Russia, subject to European Union
sanctions. With rising energy prices, inflation rose in Europe, which was
addressed by the European Central Bank with a progressive increase in interest
rates. Furthermore, the PNRR (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza [it])
had to be re-calibrated and re-agreed with the European Union, to address the
new geopolitical situation which led to the energy crisis and damage to supply
chains, causing shortages in raw materials. In March 2023, the United States
banking crisis occurred with some bankruptcies and restructuring of American
banks, however it was soon understood that it was a short-lived economic-
financial phenomenon limited to the United States, although with some concern,
it has not had an impact in the European area, with the exception of the
collapse of Credit Suisse, in Switzerland. As a consequence, Italy is
witnessing a tightening of its credit policies.

For Italian banks, there was an opportunity to strengthen themselves, thanks
to the high rates imposed by the European Central Bank. The new BTP Valore
bonds were released, which were very successful among the private operators to
whom they were marketed due to the high interest rates. From October 7, 2023,
geopolitical tensions are becoming more intense, related to the conflict in
the Middle East. In 2024, however, the Italian economy continues to maintain
its resilient strength, thanks to the reduction in energy prices, and the
maintenance or reduction of oil prices, this stability allows a reduction in
inflation. In September 2024, the European Central Bank has decreased interest
rates by 0.25 percentage points. The Italian economy copes with a geopolitical
scenario that was significantly deteriorating with the exacerbation of ongoing
war conflicts. Strategic assets are better protected, in particular the
defense sector. Furthermore, the implementation of the PNRR plan, which must
be completed by 2026, has brought benefits to many economic sectors.

### Longevity Economy

The Italian economy would appear to be disadvantaged by the factor of
demographic decline, however new technologies including artificial
intelligence, which can automate and improve some activities, always under
human supervision, optimize work processes with a reduction in costs. In this
framework of economic transformation, between environmental sustainability and
the application of artificial intelligence in industry, disadvantaged by the
persistence and entrenchment of geopolitical conflicts and tensions, trade
protectionism and de-globalization, Italian companies are more flexible and
optimized to respond to the change in commercial demand. The Italian economy,
in addition to being resilient, is evolving into an economy of longevity. On
23 May 2025, Moody's confirmed Italy’s rating at Baa3 and improved the outlook
from stable to positive. Public debt refinancing auctions are always a
success, with excellent demand among investors, with an ever-increasing
percentage held by Italian families. The good work done by the Italian
government in controlling public debt and the high savings and low debt of
Italian families, combined with a strengthening of the Italian banking sector,
are a guarantee for the future sustainability of the debt. In June 2025, the
European Central Bank has decreased interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.
The economy, aided by a stable Italian government that protects Italy's
strategic assets, particularly the banking, defense, energy and manufacturing
sectors, is stable and growing. Furthermore, even Southern Italy, for decades
with few investment and low growth, is showing extraordinary economic
progress, a real auxiliary engine of Italy to expand the economic growth of
the entire country.

### Currency

spear depicted on the reverse

Italy has a long history of different coinage types, which spans thousands of
years. Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the medieval
Florentine florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history and
one of the most important coins in Western history, was struck in Florence in
the 13th century, while the Venetian sequin, minted from 1284 to 1797, was the
most prestigious gold coin in circulation in the commercial centers of the
Mediterranean Sea.

Despite the fact that the first Italian coinage systems were used in the Magna
Graecia and Etruscan civilization, the Romans introduced a widespread currency
throughout Italy. Unlike most modern coins, Roman coins had intrinsic value.
The early modern Italian coins were very similar in style to French francs,
especially in decimals, since it was ruled by the country in the Napoleonic
Kingdom of Italy. They corresponded to a value of 0.29 grams of gold or 4.5
grams of silver.

Since Italy has been for centuries divided into many historic states, they all
had different coinage systems, but when the country became unified in 1861,
the Italian lira came into place, and was used until 2002. The term originates
from _libra_ , the largest unit of the Carolingian monetary system used in
Western Europe and elsewhere from the 8th to the 20th century. In 1999, the
euro became Italy's unit of account and the lira became a national subunit of
the euro at a rate of 1 euro = 1,936.27 lire, before being replaced as cash in
2002.

Map of the Italian diaspora in the world

In the decades following the unification of Italy, the northern regions of the
country, Lombardy, Piedmont and Liguria in particular, began a process of
industrialization and economic development while the southern regions remained
behind. At the time of the unification of the country, there was a shortage of
entrepreneurs in the south, with landowners who were often absent from their
farms as they lived permanently in the city, leaving the management of their
funds to managers, who were not encouraged by the owners to make the
agricultural estates to the maximum. Landowners invested not in agricultural
equipment, but in such things as low-risk state bonds.

In southern Italy, the unification of the country broke down the feudal land
system, which had survived in the south since the Middle Ages, especially
where land had been the inalienable property of aristocrats, religious bodies
or the king. The breakdown of feudalism, however, and redistribution of land
did not necessarily lead to small farmers in the south winding up with land of
their own or land they could work and make profit from. Many remained
landless, and plots grew smaller and smaller and so less and less productive,
as land was subdivided amongst heirs.

This gap between northern and southern Italy, called "southern question", was
also induced by the region-specific policies selected by the post-unitary
governments. For example, the 1887 protectionist reform, instead of
safeguarding the arboriculture sectors crushed by 1880s fall in prices,
shielded the Po Valley wheat breeding and those Northern textile and
manufacturing industries that had survived the liberal years due to state
intervention. A similar logic guided the assignment of monopoly rights in the
steamboat construction and navigation sectors and, above all, the public
spending in the railway sector, which represented 53% of the 1861–1911 total.

The resources necessary to finance the public spending effort were obtained
through highly unbalanced land property taxes, which affected the key source
of savings available for investment in the growth sectors absent a developed
banking system. Given the inability of the government to estimate the land
profitability, especially because of the huge differences among the regional
cadast:ers, this policy irreparably induced large regional discrepancies. This
policy destroyed the relationship between the central state and the Southern
population by unchaining first a civil war called Brigandage, which brought
about 20,000 victims by 1864 and the militarization of the area, and then
favouring emigration, especially from 1892 to 1921.

The north–south gap was intensified by language differences. Southerners spoke
the Sicilian language or a variation of it: a language that developed from
Latin and other influences independently of and prior to the Tuscan dialect
that was adopted as the official Italian language ("standard Italian"). The
Sicilian language is a complete, distinct language with its own vocabulary,
syntax and grammar rules, the latter being less complex than standard Italian.
But because of its similarity to Italian, northerners incorrectly assumed that
it was an imperfect dialect of Italian and denigrated it as the "dialect of
the poor and ignorant". This has led to continued bias by the North against
southerners who "don't speak proper Italian".

After the rise of Benito Mussolini, the "Iron Prefect" Cesare Mori tried to
defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the South
with some degree of success. Fascist policy aimed at the creation of an
Italian Empire and Southern Italian ports were strategic for all commerce
towards the colonies. With the invasion of Southern Italy during World War II,
the Allies restored the authority of the mafia families, lost during the
Fascist period, and used their influence to maintain public order. Mussolini
also established laws requiring standard Italian to be taught in school, and
discouraging the use of local Italian dialects throughout the nation, as well
as the Sicilian language.

In the 1950s the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master
plan to help industrialize the South, aiming to do this in two ways: through
land reforms creating 120,000 new smallholdings, and through the "Growth Pole
Strategy" whereby 60% of all government investment would go to the South, thus
boosting the Southern economy by attracting new capital, stimulating local
firms, and providing employment. However, the objectives were largely missed,
and as a result, the South became increasingly subsidized and state-dependent,
incapable of generating private growth itself.

The imbalance between North and South was reduced in the 1960s and 1970s
through the construction of public works, the implementation of agrarian and
scholastic reforms, the expansion of industrialization and the improved living
conditions of the population. This convergence process was interrupted,
however, in the 1980s. To date, the per capita GDP of the South is just 58% of
that of the Center-North, but this gap is mitigated by the fact that there the
cost of living is around 10-15% lower on average (with even more differences
between small towns and big cities) than that in the North of Italy. In the
South the unemployment rate is more than double (6.7% in the North against
14.9% in the South). A study by Censis blames the pervasive presence of
criminal organizations for the delay of Southern Italy, estimating an annual
loss of wealth of 2.5% in the South in the period between 1981–2003 due to
their presence, and that without them the per capita GDP of the South would
have reached that of the North.

## Economic sectors

### Primary

Vineyards in Langhe and Montferrat, Piedmont. Italy is the world's largest
wine producer (22% of the global market), as well as the country with the
widest variety of indigenous grapevine in the world. Cultivated field in
Umbria. The Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi is in the background.

According to the last national agricultural census, there were 1.6 million
farms in 2010 (−32.4% since 2000) covering 12,700,000 ha or 31,382,383 acres
(63% of which are located in Southern Italy). The vast majority (99%) are
family-operated and small, averaging only 8 ha (20 acres) in size. Of the
total surface area in agricultural use (forestry excluded), grain fields take
up 31%, olive tree orchards 8.2%, vineyards 5.4%, citrus orchards 3.8%, sugar
beets 1.7%, and horticulture 2.4%. The remainder is primarily dedicated to
pastures (25.9%) and feed grains (11.6%). The northern part of Italy produces
primarily maize corn, rice, sugar beets, soybeans, meat, fruits and dairy
products, while the South specializes in wheat, olive and citrus fruits.
Livestock includes 6 million head of cattle, 8.6 million head of swine, 6.8
million head of sheep, and 0.9 million head of goats. The total annual
production of the fishing industry in Italy from capture and aquaculture,
including crustaceans and molluscs, is around 480,000 tons.

Italy is the largest producer of wine in the world, and one of the leading
producers of olive oil, fruits (apples, olives, grapes, oranges, lemons,
pears, apricots, hazelnuts, peaches, cherries, plums, strawberries, and
kiwifruits), and vegetables (especially artichokes and tomatoes). The most
famous Italian wines are the Tuscan Chianti and the Piedmontese Barolo. Other
famous wines are Barbaresco, Barbera d'Asti, Brunello di Montalcino, Frascati,
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Morellino di Scansano, Amarone della Valpolicella
DOCG and the sparkling wines Franciacorta and Prosecco. Quality goods in which
Italy specialises, particularly the already mentioned wines and regional
cheeses, are often protected under the quality assurance labels DOC/DOP. This
geographical indication certificate, which is attributed by the European
Union, is considered important to avoid confusion with low-quality mass-
produced ersatz products.

In fact, Italian cuisine is one of the most popular and copied around the
world. The lack or total unavailability of some of its most characteristic
ingredients outside of Italy, also and above all to falsifications (or food
fraud), leads to the complete denaturalization of Italian ingredients. This
phenomenon, widespread in all continents, is better known as _Italian
Sounding_ , consisting in the use of words as well as images, colour
combinations (the Italian tricolour), geographical references, brands
evocative of Italy to promote and market agri-food products which in reality
have nothing to do with Italian cuisine.

Italy is the world's sixth-largest manufacturing country. Italy has a smaller
number of global multinational corporations than other economies of comparable
size, but it has a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, many of
them grouped in clusters, which are the backbone of the Italian industry. This
results in a manufacturing sector often focused on the export of niche market
and luxury products, that is less capable of competing on quantity but is more
capable of facing the competition of emerging economies based on lower labour
costs, given the higher quality of its products.

The industrial districts are regionalized: in the Northwest, there is a large
modern group of industries, as in the so-called "industrial triangle" (Milan-
Turin-Genoa), where there is an area of intense machinery, automotive,
aerospace production and shipbuilding; in the Northeast, an area that
experienced social and economic development mostly around family-based firms,
there are mostly small and medium enterprises of lower technology but high
craftsmanship, specializing in machinery, clothing, leather products,
footwear, furniture, textiles, machine tools, spare parts, home appliances,
and jewellery. In central Italy, there are mostly small and medium-sized
companies specializing in products such as textiles, leather, jewellery but
also machinery. According to a study carried out in 2015 by the Edison
Foundation and Confindustria on the most industrialized provinces in Europe,
of the five most industrialized provinces in Europe, three are Italian
provinces. Brescia turns out to be the first European province for value added
by industry, with an added value over 10 billion euros.

The automotive industry in Italy is a significant part of the manufacturing
sector, with over 144,000 firms and almost 485,000 employed people in 2015,
and a contribution of 8.5% to Italian GDP. Italy's automotive industry is best
known for its automobile designs and small city cars, sports and supercars.
Italy is one of the significant automobile producers both in Europe and around
the world. Today the Italian automotive industry is almost totally dominated
by Fiat Group (now included in Stellantis corporation). As well as its own,
predominantly mass market model range, Stellantis owns the mainstream Fiat
brand, the upmarket Alfa Romeo and Lancia brands, and the exotic Maserati
brand. Luxury cars such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Ducati
motorcycles are also made in the Northeast region of Emilia-Romagna. Italian
cars have won the annual European Car of the Year award several times (with
Fiat winning more than any other manufacturer), and have also been awarded the
World Car of the Year award.

In Italy, services represent the most important sector of the economy, both in
terms of number of employees (67% of the total) and value-added (71%).
Furthermore, the sector is by far the most dynamic: over 51% of the more than
5,000,000 companies operating in Italy today belong to the services sector,
and in this sector over 67% of new businesses are born. Very important
activities in Italy are tourism, trade, services to people and businesses
(advanced tertiary).

In 2006 the main sectoral data are: for trade, there are 1,600,000
enterprises, equal to 26% of the Italian entrepreneurial fabric, and over
3,500,000 work units. Transport, communications, tourism and consumption
outside the home, over 582,000 businesses, equal to 9.5% of the
entrepreneurial fabric, almost 3,500,000 work units. Business services:
630,000 registered companies, equal to 10.3% of the entrepreneurial fabric,
over 2,800,000 work units. In 2004 the transport sector in Italy generated a
turnover of about 119.4 billion euros, employing 935,700 persons in 153,700
enterprises.

Italian Bourse, based in Milan, is the Italian stock exchange. It manages and
organises the domestic market, regulating procedures for admission and listing
of companies and intermediaries and supervising disclosures for listed
companies. Following exchange privatisation in 1997, the Italian Bourse was
established and became effective on 2 January 1998. On 23 June 2007, the
Italian Bourse became a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group. As of
April 2018, overall capitalisation for listed companies on Borsa Italiana was
worth €644.3 billion, representing 37.8% of Italian GDP.

Italy is the fourth most visited country, with a total of 57 million arrivals
in 2023. The total contribution of the tourism in Italy to GDP (including
wider effects from investment, the supply chain and induced income impacts)
was EUR162.7bn in 2014 (10.1% of GDP) and generated 1,082,000 jobs directly in
2014 (4.8% of total employment). Factors of tourist interest in Italy are
mainly culture, cuisine, history, fashion, architecture, art, religious sites
and routes, wedding tourism, naturalistic beauties, nightlife, underwater
sites and spas. Winter and summer tourism are present in many locations in the
Alps and the Apennines, while seaside tourism is widespread in coastal
locations on the Mediterranean Sea. Italy is the leading cruise tourism
destination in the Mediterranean Sea. Small, historical and artistic Italian
villages are promoted through the association _I Borghi più belli d'Italia_
(literally "The Most Beautiful Villages of Italy").

The origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early Renaissance
Italy, to the rich cities like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Venice and Genoa. The
Bardi and Peruzzi families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence,
establishing branches in many other parts of Europe. One of the most famous
Italian banks was the Medici Bank, set up by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici in
1397. The earliest known state deposit bank, the Bank of Saint George, was
founded in 1407 in Genoa, while Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, founded in
1472, is the world's oldest or second oldest bank in continuous operation,
depending on the definition, and the third-largest Italian commercial and
retail bank. Today, among the financial services companies, UniCredit is one
of the largest banks in Europe by capitalization and Assicurazioni Generali is
second largest insurance group in the world by revenue after AXA.

renewable energy.

Italy consumed about 185 Mtoe of primary energy in 2010. This came mostly from
fossil fuels. Among the most used resources are petroleum (mostly used for the
transport sector), natural gas (used for electric energy production and
heating), coal and renewables. Electricity is produced mainly from natural
gas, which accounts for the source of more than half of the total final
electric energy produced. Another important source is hydroelectric power,
which was practically the only source of electricity until 1960.

Eni, with operations in 79 countries, is considered one of the seven
"Supermajor" oil companies in the world, and one of the world's largest
industrial companies. The Val d'Agri area, Basilicata, hosts the largest
onshore hydrocarbon field in Europe. Moderate natural gas reserves, mainly in
the Po Valley and offshore Adriatic Sea, have been discovered in recent years
and constitute the country's most important mineral resource.

Natural resources of Italy. Metals are in blue (Al – aluminium ore, Mn —
manganese, Fe – iron ore, Hg — mercury, PM – polymetallic ores (Cu, Zn, Ag,
Pb), PY — pyrite). Fossil fuels are in red (C – coal, G – natural gas, L —
lignite, P – petroleum). Non-metallic minerals are in green (ASB — asbestos, F
— fluorite, K — potash, MAR — marble, S — sulfur).

Most raw materials needed for manufacturing and more than 80% of the country's
energy sources are imported (99.7% of the solid fuels demand, 92.5% of oil,
91.2% of natural gas and 13% of electricity). Due to its reliance on imports,
Italians pay approximately 45% more than the EU average for electricity.

In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's largest producers of
renewable energy, ranking as the second largest producer in the European Union
and the ninth in the world. Wind power, hydroelectricity, and geothermal power
are also important sources of electricity in the country. Italy was the first
country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity. The first Italian
geothermal power plant was built in Tuscany, which is where all currently
active geothermal plants in Italy are located. In 2014 the geothermal
production was 5.92 TWh.

Solar energy production alone accounted for almost 9% of the total electric
production in the country in 2014, making Italy the country with the highest
contribution from solar energy in the world. The Montalto di Castro
Photovoltaic Power Station, completed in 2010, is the largest photovoltaic
power station in Italy with 85 MW. Other examples of large PV plants in Italy
are San Bellino (70.6 MW), Cellino san Marco (42.7 MW) and Sant’ Alberto (34.6
MW). Italy was also the first country to exploit geothermal energy to produce
electricity.

Renewable sources account for 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy, with
hydro alone reaching 12.6%, followed by solar at 5.7%, wind at 4.1%, bioenergy
at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%. The rest of the national demand is covered by
fossil fuels (38.2% natural gas, 13% coal, 8.4% oil) and by imports.

Italy has managed four nuclear reactors until the 1980s, but in 1987, after
the Chernobyl disaster, a large majority of Italians passed a referendum
opting for phasing out nuclear power in Italy. The government responded by
closing existing nuclear power plants and stopping work on projects underway,
continuing to work to the nuclear energy program abroad. The national power
company Enel operates seven nuclear reactors in Spain (through Endesa) and
four in Slovakia (through Slovenské elektrárne), and in 2005 made an agreement
with Électricité de France for a nuclear reactor in France. With these
agreements, Italy has managed to access nuclear power and direct involvement
in design, construction, and operation of the plants without placing reactors
on Italian territory.

In the early 1970s Italy was a major producer of pyrites (from the Tuscan
Maremma), asbestos (from the Balangero mines), fluorite (found in Sicily), and
salt. At the same time, it was self-sufficient in aluminium (from Gargano),
sulphur (from Sicily), lead, and zinc (from Sardinia). By the beginning of the
1990s, however, it had lost all its world-ranking positions and was no longer
self-sufficient in those resources. There are no substantial deposits of iron,
coal, or oil. Italy is one of the world's leading producers of pumice,
pozzolana, and feldspar. Another mineral resource for which Italy is well-
known is marble, especially the world-famous white Carrara marble from the
Massa and Carrara quarries in Tuscany.

### Transportation

The _Autostrada dei Laghi_ ("Lakes Motorway"; now parts of the Autostrada A8
and the Autostrada A9) near Besnate, the first motorway built in the world.

Regarding the national road network, in 2002 there were 668,721 km (415,524
mi) of serviceable roads in Italy, including 6,487 km (4,031 mi) of motorways,
state-owned but privately operated by Atlantia. In 2005, about 34,667,000
passenger cars (590 cars per 1,000 people) and 4,015,000 goods vehicles
circulated on the national road network.

Italy was the first country in the world to build motorways, the so-called
_autostrade_ , reserved for fast traffic and for motor vehicles only. The
_Autostrada dei Laghi_ ("Lakes Motorway"), the first built in the world,
connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now parts of the A8 and
A9 motorways, was devised by Piero Puricelli and was inaugurated in 1924. He
received the first authorization to build a public-utility fast road in 1921.
By the end of the 1930s, over 400 kilometres of multi- and dual-single-lane
motorways were constructed throughout Italy, linking cities and rural towns.
Italy is one of the countries with the most vehicles per capita, with 690 per
1000 people in 2010.

FS' Frecciarossa 1000 high speed train at Milano Centrale railway station,
with a maximum speed of 400 km/h (249 mph), is one of the fastest trains in
Europe.

The national railway network is also extensive, especially in the north,
totalizing 16,862 km of which 69% are electrified and on which 4,937
locomotives and railcars circulate. It is the 12th largest in the world, and
is operated by state-owned Ferrovie dello Stato, while the rail tracks and
infrastructure are managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana. While a number of
private railroads exist and provide mostly commuter-type services, the
national railway also provides sophisticated high-speed rail service that
joins the major cities. The Florence–Rome high-speed railway was the first
high-speed line opened in Europe when more than half of it opened in 1977. In
1991 the TAV was created for the planning and construction of high-speed rail
lines along Italy's most important and saturated transport routes (Milan-Rome-
Naples and Turin-Milan-Venice). High-speed trains include ETR-class trains,
with the Frecciarossa 1000 reaching 400 km/h. Higher-speed trains are divided
into three categories: Frecciarossa (English: red arrow) trains operate at a
maximum speed of 300 km/h on dedicated high-speed tracks; Frecciargento
(English: silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum speed of 250 km/h on both
high-speed and mainline tracks; and Frecciabianca (English: white arrow)
trains operate on high-speed regional lines at a maximum speed of 200 km/h.
Italy has 11 rail border crossings over the Alpine mountains with its
neighbouring countries.

21st Century Silk Road with its connections to Italy

Since October 2021, Italy's flag carrier airline is ITA Airways, which took
over the brand, the IATA ticketing code, and many assets belonging to the
former flag carrier Alitalia, after its bankruptcy. ITA Airways serves 44
destinations (as of October 2021[update]) and also operates the former
Alitalia regional subsidiary, Alitalia CityLiner. The country also has
regional airlines (such as Air Dolomiti), low-cost carriers, and Charter and
leisure carriers (including Neos, Blue Panorama Airlines and Poste Air Cargo).
Major Italian cargo operators are Alitalia Cargo and Cargolux Italia. Italy is
the fifth in Europe by number of passengers by air transport, with about 148
million passengers or about 10% of the European total in 2011. There are
approximately 130 airports in Italy, of which 99 have paved runways (including
the two hubs of Leonardo Da Vinci International in Rome and Malpensa
International in Milan).

Italy has been the final destination of the Silk Road for many centuries. In
particular, the construction of the Suez Canal intensified sea trade with East
Africa and Asia from the 19th century. Since the end of the Cold War and
increasing European integration, trade relations, which were often interrupted
in the 20th century, have intensified again. In 2004 there were 43 major
seaports including the Port of Genoa, the country's largest and the third
busiest by cargo tonnage in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the increasing
importance of the maritime Silk Road with its connections to Asia and East
Africa, the Italian ports for Central and Eastern Europe have become important
in recent years. In addition, the trade in goods is shifting from the European
northern ports to the ports of the Mediterranean Sea due to the considerable
time savings and environmental protection. In particular, the deep water port
of Trieste in the northernmost part of the Mediterranean Sea is the target of
Italian, Asian and European investments. The national inland waterway network
comprises 1,477 km (918 mi) of navigable rivers and channels. In 2007 Italy
maintained a civilian air fleet of about 389,000 units and a merchant fleet of
581 ships.

## Poverty

Two rough sleepers in Milan

In 2015, poverty in Italy hit the highest levels in the previous 10 years. The
level of absolute poverty for a two-person family was €1050.95/month. The
poverty line per capita changed by region from €552.39/month to €819.13/month.
The number of those in absolute poverty rose nearly an entire per cent in
2015, from 6.8% in 2014 to 7.6% in 2015. In Southern Italy the numbers are
even higher, with 10% living in absolute poverty, up from 9 per cent in 2014.
Northern Italy is better off at 6.7%, but this is still an increase from 5.7%
in 2014.

The national statistics reporting agency, ISTAT, defines absolute poverty as
those who can not buy goods and services which they need to survive. In 2015,
the proportion of poor households in relative poverty also increased to 13.7
from 12.9 in 2014. ISTAT defines relative poverty as people whose disposable
income is less than around half the national average. The unemployment rate in
February 2016 remained at 11.7%, which has been the same for almost a year,
but even having a job does not guarantee freedom from poverty.

Those who have at least one family member employed still suffer from 6.1% to
11.7% poverty, the higher number being for those who have factory jobs. The
numbers are even higher for the younger generations because their unemployment
rate is over 40%. Also, children are hit hard. In 2014, 32% of those aged 0–17
were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, which is one child out of three.
While in the north the poverty rate is about the same as that of France and
Germany, in the south it is almost double that figure. In the last ISTAT
report, poverty is in decline.[_needs update_] According to the 2022 ISTAT
Poverty Report, 2.18 million households and 5.6 million people live in
absolute poverty in Italy.

According to Eurostat, by 2023, 63% of Italian households will struggle to
make ends meet, making it one of the European countries with the most
widespread economic difficulties, surpassing France, Poland, Spain and
Portugal. The European average is 45.5%.

The average annual gross salary in Italy was €41,646 ($44,893) in 2022,
placing the country at the twenty-first position in the OECD area, with lower
wages compared to the EU average. Many Italians still face significant
challenges in meeting basic living expenses due to high living costs and
regional economic disparities.
