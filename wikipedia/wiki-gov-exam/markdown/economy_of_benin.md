The **economy of Benin** remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence
agriculture and cotton. Cotton accounts for 40% of Benin's GDP and roughly 80%
of official export receipts. There is also production of textiles, palm
products, and cocoa beans. Maize (corn), beans, rice, peanuts, cashews,
pineapples, cassava, yams, and other various tubers are grown for local
subsistence. Benin began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in
October 1982. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites
is ongoing.

A modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and
export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now
privatized. A French brewer acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller
businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are
foreign owned, primarily French and Lebanese. The private commercial and
agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.

## Economic development

Since the transition to a democratic government in 1990, Benin has undergone
an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both
private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the
early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices
(although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing
sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in
processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A
planned joint hydroelectric project with neighboring Togo is intended to
reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from Ghana, which
currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports.

The service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization
and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and
computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the CFA Franc Zone
offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic
support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities,
to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source
for imports. Benin is also a member of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS).

Despite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped
and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional
trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid
population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis. Inflation
has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities,
which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in Nigeria,
particularly fuel shortages.

Although trade unions in Benin represent up to 75% of the formal workforce,
the large informal economy has been noted by the International Trade Union
Confederation (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's
wage equality, the use of child labour, and the continuing issue of forced
labour.

In December 2014, the Bureau of International Labor Affairs issued a _List of
Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor_ in which the Republic of Benin
was mentioned among 74 other countries where significant instances of child
labor were observed. Two major products involved such working conditions in
Benin: cotton and crushed granite.

## Agriculture

Benin produced in 2018:

  * 3.8 million tons of cassava (17th largest producer in the world);
  * 2.7 million tons of yam (4th largest producer in the world, losing only to Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast);
  * 1.5 million tons of maize;
  * 758 thousand tons of cotton (12th largest producer in the world);
  * 598 thousand tons of palm oil;
  * 459 thousand tons of rice;
  * 372 thousand tons of pineapple;
  * 319 thousand tons of sorghum;
  * 253 thousand tons of tomato;
  * 225 thousand tons of peanut;
  * 221 thousand tons of soy;
  * 215 thousand tons of cashew nuts (5th largest producer in the world, losing only to Vietnam, India, Ivory Coast and Philippines);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

Benin's financial sector is dominated by banks, and in general remains
shallow. However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which
resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization
of all state banks.

A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and
capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all
countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999.
There is no customer deposit insurance system.

Benin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the
Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60
percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and
Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives,
NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for
strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such
as the PRAFIDE (Programme Régional d’Appui à la finance Décentralisée). The
microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as
well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and
Women.

Benin is member of the Bourse Regionale des Valeures Mobilières (BRVM) located
in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the
region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments
of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).

The payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in
2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial
institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special
banks.
