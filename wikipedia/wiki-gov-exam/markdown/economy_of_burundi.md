The **economy of Burundi** is $6.75 billion by gross domestic product as of
2025, being heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 32.9% of
gross domestic product as of 2008. Burundi itself is a landlocked country
lacking resources, and with almost nonexistent industrialization. Agriculture
supports more than 70% of the labor force, the majority of whom are
subsistence farmers.

Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, issues
such as civil unrest, overpopulation, and soil erosion have contributed to the
contraction of the subsistence economy by 25% in recent years. Large numbers
of internally displaced persons have been unable to produce their own food and
are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance. Burundi is a
net food importer, with food accounting for 17% of imports in 1997. Burundi is
a least developed country according to the United Nations.

## Agriculture

Burundi produced in 2022:

  * 2.6 million tons of cassava;
  * 1.3 million tons of banana;
  * 808 thousand tons of sweet potato;
  * 507 thousand tons of vegetables;
  * 499 thousand tons of beans;
  * 355 thousand tons of potato;
  * 280 thousand tons of maize;
  * 188 thousand tons of sugar cane;
  * 130 thousand tons of fruit;
  * 127 thousand tons of rice;
  * 94 thousand tons of taro;
  * 89 thousand tons of palm oil;
  * 50 thousand tons of tea;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like
sorghum (25 thousand tons) and coffee (17 thousand tons).

## Industry

Little industry exists except for the processing of agricultural exports.
Although potential wealth in petroleum, nickel, copper, and other natural
resources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented
meaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by
Burundi's distance from the sea and high transport costs. Lake Tanganyika
remains an important trading point. The trade embargo, lifted in 1999,
negatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has
suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of
perhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods,
medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.

Burundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external
debt totaling $1.247 billion (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely
unsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign
exchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international
transactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.

Goat rearing has been promoted as a source of income for rural-dwelling
Burundians.

IMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the
outbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for
potential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the
introduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and
services. Other serious problems include the state's role in the economy, the
question of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.

To protest the 1996 coup by President Pierre Buyoya, neighboring countries
imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never
officially ratified by the United Nations Security Council, most countries
refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the United
States also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional
embargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in
advancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.

In an article titled "The Blood Cries Out," _Foreign Policy (FP)_ reported
that the Burundian population growth rate is 2.5 percent per year, more than
double the average global pace, and that a Burundian woman has on average 6.3
children, nearly triple the international fertility rate. _FP_ further
reported that "The vast majority of Burundians rely on subsistence farming,
but under the weight of a booming population and in the long-standing absence
of coherent policies governing land ownership, many people barely have enough
earth to sustain themselves." In 2014, the average size for a farm was about
one acre. _FP_ added that "The consequence is remarkable scarcity: In the 2013
Global Hunger Index, Burundi had the severest hunger and malnourishment rates
of all 120 countries ranked."

## Energy

Burundi is one of the least electrified countries in the world, only about 10%
of the country's population has access to electricity. In 2022, the country
produced a total of 565 GWh of electricity, 50% of which was generated via
fossil fuels while the other 50% was generated via renewables. Oil is the main
fossil fuel in use, while the renewable energy is sourced primarily from
hydropower and to a much lesser degree from solar energy as well as bioenergy.
This domestic production however does not fulfil Burundi's demand and it
imports sizeable amount of energy from neighbouring countries.

The opening of the Rusumo Hydroelectric Power Station in 2023 was a boon to
the country as Burundi receives 27 MW of electricity generated in it. The
power station combined with improved transmission cables allowed Burundi to
provide the capital city of Gitega with a more reliable and consistent power
supply. At the same time it allowed the government to decommission the old
oil-fired power station that supplied the city before and save over two
million USD in costs. This project was a part of a wider international aid-
assisted initiative in Burundi to pursue low-carbon electrification and
improving access to electricity across the country. The government also
pursues a much greater domestic hydropower project, a power station located in
Rubrizi with the help of extensive funding by the African Development Bank and
the European Union. The power station, scheduled to be completed in December
2024, is designed to generate 160 MW of electricity, making it the largest
power station in Burundi. Together with associated improvements to
transmission in infrastructure, it's predicted to provide electricity access
to 7% of the country's population.
