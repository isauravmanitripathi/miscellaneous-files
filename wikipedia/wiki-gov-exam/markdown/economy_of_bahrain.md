The **economy ofBahrain** is heavily dependent upon oil and gas. The Bahraini
Dinar is the second-highest-valued currency unit in the world. Since the late
20th century, Bahrain has heavily invested in the banking and tourism sectors.
The country's capital, Manama is home to many large financial structures.
Bahrain's finance industry is very successful. In 2008, Bahrain was named the
world's fastest growing financial center by the City of London's Global
Financial Centres Index. Bahrain's banking and financial services sector,
particularly Islamic banking, have benefited from the regional boom driven by
demand for oil. Petroleum is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for
60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP. Aluminium
is the second most exported product, followed by finance and construction
materials.

According to the 2020 edition of the _Index of Economic Freedom_ , published
by The Heritage Foundation and _The Wall Street Journal_ , Bahrain has the
fourth-freest in the Middle East and North Africa region and is the 40th-
freest economy in the world. An alternative index, published by the Fraser
Institute, puts Bahrain in 70th place. Bahrain was recognised by the World
Bank as a high income economy.

## Economy overview

Oil and natural gas play a dominant role in Bahrain’s economy. Despite efforts
to diversify the economy, according to the CIA World Fact Book: oil still
comprises 85% of Bahraini budget revenues, meaning throughout the last few
years lower world energy prices have generated sizeable budget deficits -
about 10% of GDP in 2017 alone. Bahrain is a rich country in the middle east
and the north africa (MENA) region and its economy depends on oil & gas,
international banking and tourism.

In 2003 and 2004, the balance of payments improved due to rising oil prices
and increased receipts from the services sector. As a result, the current
account balance registered a surplus of US$219 million in 2003 and a surplus
of US$442 million in 2004, compared to a deficit of US$35 million in 2002.
Bahrain's gross international reserves increased substantially in 2004 to
US$1.6 billion, up from US$1.4 billion in the previous three year (2001-2003).

## Diversification

Though Current GDP per capita Archived 2012-05-04 at the Wayback Machine
shrank by 2.4% in the 1980s, it bounced back to a growth of 36% in the 1990s
as a result of successful diversification initiatives. Bahrain's urgency in
embracing economic liberalisation is due to its need to diversify the economy
away from its limited oil supplies. Unlike its Persian Gulf neighbours,
Bahrain has little oil wealth and the economy has expanded into banking, heavy
industries, retail and tourism. The Kingdom is the main banking hub for the
Persian Gulf and a centre for Islamic finance, which has been attracted by the
strong regulatory framework for the industry. According to the International
Monetary Fund's Financial System Stability Assessment of Bahrain's financial
regulatory environment, published on 6 March 2006, found:

  * The financial system is enjoying strong performance under favorable circumstances, and is likely to remain a major contributor to overall growth. The main risk stems from potential overheating in the economies of the region, but the system should be resilient to likely shocks.
  * Prudential regulations are modern and comprehensive, and supervision is generally effective, especially in the dominant banking sector. Supervisory capacity needs to be expanded in line with new regulations and to keep up with the growth and increasing sophistication of financial institutions.
  * The further expansion of the Islamic sector, the development of housing finance, and the deepening of securities markets are important for the future growth of the financial system. The banking and insurance sectors will eventually undergo consolidation. [1]

In 2005, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, becoming the
first Persian Gulf state to sign such a bilateral trade agreement with the
United States. A massive privatization programme is underway to sell off key
government assets: utilities, banks, financial services, and
telecommunications have started to come under the control of the private
sector.

As a result, the economy has been well positioned to exploit the extra
revenues generated in the region thanks to the sustained high oil prices since
2002. In January 2006, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for
Western Asia cited Bahrain as the fastest growing economy in the Arab world.

Between 1981 and 1993, Bahrain Government expenditures increased by 64%.
During that same time, government revenues continued to be largely dependent
on the oil industry and increased by only 4%. Bahrain has at times received
significant budgetary support and project grants from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates.

The government has used its modest oil revenues to build an advanced
infrastructure in transportation and telecommunications. Bahrain is a regional
financial and business center. Tourism, especially from the region, has proved
another significant source of income.

Bahrain has benefited from the oil boom since 2001, with economic growth of
5.5%. It has succeeded in attracting investment from other Persian Gulf states
partly because it used the revenues of the 1970s-early 80s boom to invest in
infrastructure development and other projects to improve the standard of
living; health, education, housing, electricity, water, and roads all received
attention.

The success of ventures such as the Bahrain Grand Prix has raised the
Kingdom's international profile, and combined with the boom in Islamic
banking, has encouraged major airlines to resume services to the country, with
Lufthansa announcing on 14 March 2006 that it would schedule three flights a
week to Muharraq from Frankfurt Archived 2007-10-11 at the Wayback Machine.

As part of its efforts to build a modern economy, Bahrain has initiated a
series of labour reforms under Minister of Labour Majeed Al Alawi in order to
bring the labour market into line with international standards. Bahrain
intends to expand its high tech industries, invest in research and
development, and strengthen its competitive edge within a global economy. In
2006,it was announced that the Bahrain Science and Technology Park,a Kuwait
Finance House Bahrain initiative would be a reflection of this effort to
create a diversified economy, provide high quality jobs for locals and
international workforce, providing a place for innovative and inventive
thinking that will have direct benefits to the island nation.

In 2009 it was announced that the Bahraini Government would be developing land
next door to the Bahrain International Circuit. The project being managed by
@Bahrain is a mix of facilities including an exhibition and convention
facility, a choice of hotel accommodations ranging from mid-market to luxury,
a multi-purpose indoor arena, an automotive club and engineering facility,
retail and leisure establishments, a tech-tainment (technology interacting
with entertainment) centre, a research institute, a technology park and a
focus on education and training. @Bahrain is part of the Mumtalakat group of
companies and will dedicate more than 1 million square meters of business,
entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of $2bn (BD 850
million), making it one of the largest investment projects to take place in
Bahrain in the past five years.

In July 2023, Bahrain's national origin exports decreased by 23%, valued at
BD323 million, while imports fell by 6% to BD441 million, resulting in a trade
deficit of BD68 million, according to the Information & eGovernment Authority
(iGA) report.

Overall during 2023, Bahrain's GDP grew by 2.45%, with the non-oil sector
showing a robust increase of 4.48%, indicating the country's successful
efforts towards economic diversification. The Bahrain Economic Development
Board played a crucial role in enhancing Bahrain's investment climate,
actively facilitating the entry of international investors and expanding the
sectors open to 100% foreign ownership, including significant initiatives in
the oil and gas sectors under certain conditions.

$21,176 million in 2008 by the World Bank.[2] Bahrain is generally a country
which is open to creating a unique economy which is fast growing and open for
all to create business opportunities.

## Hydrocarbon industry

Petroleum and natural gas are the only significant natural resources in
Bahrain. Because of limited reserves, Bahrain has worked to diversify its
economy over the decade prior to 2004. Bahrain has stabilized its oil
production at about 40,000 barrels (6,400 m³) per day, and reserves are
expected to last 10 to 15 years. The Bahrain Petroleum Company refinery was
built in 1935, has a capacity of about 250,000 barrels (40,000 m³) per day,
and was the first in the Persian Gulf outside of Iran. After selling 60% of
the refinery to the state-owned Bahrain National Oil Company in 1980, Caltex,
a U.S. company, now owns 40%. Saudi Arabia provides most of the crude for
refinery operation via pipeline. Bahrain also receives a large portion of the
net output and revenues from Saudi Arabia's Abu Saafa offshore oilfield.

The Bahrain National Gas Company operates a gas liquefaction plant that
utilizes gas piped directly from Bahrain's oilfields. Gas reserves should last
about 50 years at present rates of consumption. The Gulf Petrochemical
Industries Company (GPIC) is a joint venture of the petrochemical industries
of Kuwait, the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, and the Government of
Bahrain. The plant, completed in 1985, produces ammonia, methanol and urea for
export.

Bahrain's other industries include Aluminum Bahrain, which operates an
aluminum smelter—the largest in the world with an annual production of about
1,500,000 metric tons—and related factories, such as the Aluminum Extrusion
Company and the Gulf Aluminum Rolling Mill Company (GARMCO)[3]. Other plants
include the Arab Iron and Steel Company's iron ore pelletizing plant (4
million tons annually) and a shipbuilding and repair yard.

Bahrain's development as a major financial center has been the most widely
heralded aspect of its diversification effort. International financial
institutions operate in Bahrain, both offshore and onshore, without
impediments. In 2001, Bahrain's central bank issued 15 new licenses. More than
100 offshore banking units and representative offices are located in Bahrain,
as well as 65 American firms. Bahrain's international airport is one of
busiest in the Persian Gulf, serving 22 carriers. A modern, busy port offers
direct and frequent cargo shipping connections to the U.S., Europe, and the
Far East. Internationally recognised Bahraini companies include Investcorp,
the venture capital firm credited with turning around the fortunes of Gucci.

## Taxation

Taxation and import laws apply equally to Bahraini and foreign-owned
companies, and foreign investors must comply with the same requirements and
legislation as local firms.

Oil and gas companies are taxed 46 percent on income derived from the sale of
hydrocarbons and derivative products.

There is no personal income tax in Bahrain.

Employers and workers must pay social insurance contributions as follows:  
(1) for old-age, disability and survivor protection: for Bahraini employees,
since May 2022, employers pay 14% of salary plus constant allowances, the
percentage will rise by 1% each year (up to 20% in 2028), workers pay 7% plus
constant allowances; for non-Bahraini employees, employers pay 3% of salary
plus constant allowances (then being entitled only to employment injury
benefits).  
(2) for unemployment insurance: since June 1, 2007, all wages are subject to a
2% tax, paid for equally by the employer and the employee, applicable both to
nationals and non-citizens and supplemented by a government contribution of
1%. This makes Bahrain the first of the GCC countries to implement a UI
scheme.
