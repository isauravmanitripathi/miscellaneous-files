The United States has a highly developed mixed economy. It is the world's
largest economy by nominal GDP and second largest by purchasing power parity
(PPP). As of 2025, it has the world's seventh highest nominal GDP per capita
and ninth highest GDP per capita by PPP. The U.S. accounts for 27% of the
global economy in 2025 in nominal terms, and about 16% in PPP terms. The U.S.
dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and
is the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its
role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked
eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others
it is the _de facto_ currency. Since the end of World War II, the economy has
achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid
advances in technology.

The American economy is fueled by high productivity, well-developed
transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have
the sixth highest average household and employee income among OECD member
states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income among OECD
countries, although the country also had one of the world's highest income
inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners
are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom,
Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and
second-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries,
including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea,
Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation. The U.S.
has a highly flexible labor market, where the industry adheres to a hire-and-
fire policy, and job security is relatively low. Among OECD nations, the U.S.
has a highly efficient social security system; social expenditure stood at
roughly 30% of GDP.

The United States is the world's largest producer of petroleum, natural gas,
and blood products. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country, and
second largest manufacturer, with American manufacturing making up a fifth of
the global total. The U.S. has the largest internal market for goods, and also
dominates the services trade. Total U.S. trade was $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of
the world's 500 largest companies, 139 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S.
has the world's highest number of billionaires, with total wealth of $5.7
trillion. U.S. commercial banks had $22.9 trillion in assets in December 2022.
U.S. global assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets.
During the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant
decline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was enacted by the United
States Congress, and in the ensuing years the U.S. experienced the longest
economic expansion on record by July 2019.

The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges
by market capitalization and trade volume. The U.S. has the world's largest
gold reserves, with over 8,000 tonnes of gold. In 2014, the U.S. economy was
ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research
and development funding. The U.S. spends around 3.46% of GDP on cutting-edge
research and development across various sectors of the economy. Consumer
spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of
income was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The
nation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its
net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the
top-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index,
the Global Competitiveness Report, and others.

## History

### Colonial era and 18th century

The economic history of the United States began with British settlements along
the Eastern seaboard in the 17th and 18th centuries. After 1700, the United
States gained population rapidly, and imports as well as exports grew along
with it. Africa, Asia, and most frequently Europe, contributed to the trade of
the colonies. These 13 colonies gained independence from the British Empire in
the late 18th century and quickly grew from colonial economies towards an
economy focused on agriculture.

### 19th century

In 180 years, the United States grew to become a huge, integrated, and
industrialized economy, which made up about a fifth of the world economy. In
that process, the U.S. GDP per capita rose past that of many other countries,
supplanting the British Empire at the top. The economy maintained high wages,
attracting immigrants by the millions from all over the world. In the 1820s
and 1830s, mass production shifted much of the economy from artisans to
factories. New government regulations strengthened patents.

Early in the 19th century, more than 80 percent of Americans engaged in
farming. Most of the manufacturing centered on the first stages of the
transformation of raw materials, with lumber and sawmills, textiles, and boots
and shoes leading the way. The rich natural resources contributed to the rapid
economic expansion of the nineteenth century. Ample land allowed the number of
farmers to keep growing; but activity in manufacturing, services,
transportation, and other sectors grew much faster, so that by 1860 the
population was only about 50 percent rural, down from over 80 percent.

In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with financial crises.
The Panic of 1837 was followed by a five-year depression, marked by bank
failures and unprecedented unemployment. Because of the great changes in the
economy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern
recessions to that of early recessions. Recessions after World War II appear
to have been less severe than earlier recessions, but the reasons for this are
unclear.

### 20th century

At the beginning of the century, new innovations and improvements in existing
innovations opened the door for improvements in the standard of living among
American consumers. Many firms grew large by taking advantage of economies of
scale and better communication to run nationwide operations. Concentration in
these industries raised fears of monopolies that would drive prices higher and
output lower, but many of these firms were cutting costs so fast that trends
were towards lower prices and more output in these industries. Many workers
shared the success of these large firms, which typically offered the highest
wages in the world.

The United States has been the world's largest national economy in terms of
GDP since around 1890. For many years following the Great Depression of the
1930s, when the danger of recession appeared most serious, the government
strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that
consumers would spend more and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply,
which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for
stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s.
From the New Deal era that began in 1933 to the Great Society initiatives of
the 1960s, national policymakers relied principally on fiscal policy to
influence the economy.

During the world wars of the twentieth century, the United States fared better
than the rest of the combatants because none of the First World War and
relatively little of the Second World War were fought on American territory
(and none on the then-48 states). Yet, even in the United States, the wars
meant sacrifice. During the peak of Second World War activity, nearly 40
percent of U.S. GDP was devoted to war production. Decisions about large
swaths of the economy were largely made for military purposes, and nearly all
relevant inputs were allocated to the war effort. Many goods were rationed,
prices and wages controlled, and many durable consumer goods were no longer
produced. Large segments of the workforce were inducted into the military and
paid half their wages; roughly half of those were sent into harm's way.

The approach, advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes, gave elected
officials a leading role in directing the economy since spending and taxes are
controlled by the U.S. president and Congress. The "Baby Boom" saw a dramatic
increase in fertility in the period 1942โ1957; it was caused by delayed
marriages and childbearing during the depression years, a surge in prosperity,
a demand for suburban single-family homes (as opposed to inner city
apartments), and new optimism about the future. The boom peaked around 1957
and then began to fade. A period of high inflation, interest rates, and
unemployment after 1973 weakened confidence in fiscal policy as a tool for
regulating the overall pace of economic activity.

The U.S. economy grew by an average of 3.8% from 1946 to 1973, while real
median household income surged by 74% (or 2.1% a year).

Since the 1970s, several emerging countries have begun to close the economic
gap with the United States. In most cases, this has been due to moving the
manufacture of goods formerly made in the U.S. to countries where they could
be made for sufficiently less money to cover the cost of shipping plus a
higher profit. In other cases, some countries have gradually learned to
produce the same products and services that previously only the U.S. and a few
other countries could produce. Real income growth in the U.S. has slowed. In
the 1970s and 1980s, it was popular in the U.S. to believe that Japan's
economy would surpass that of the U.S., but this did not occur.

### 21st century

The United States economy experienced a recession in 2001 with an unusually
slow jobs recovery, with the number of jobs not regaining the February 2001
level until January 2005. This "jobless recovery" overlapped with the building
of a housing bubble and arguably a wider debt bubble, as the ratio of
household debt to GDP rose from a record level of 70% in Q1 2001 to 99% in Q1
2008. Homeowners were borrowing against their bubble-priced homes to fuel
consumption, driving up their debt levels while providing an unsustainable
boost to GDP. When housing prices began falling in 2006, the value of
securities backed by mortgages fell dramatically, causing the equivalent of a
bank run in the essentially unregulated non-depository banking system, which
had outgrown the traditional, regulated depository banking system. Many
mortgage companies and other non-depository banks (e.g., investment banks)
faced a worsening crisis in 2007โ2008, with the banking crisis peaking in
September 2008, with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and bailouts of several
other financial institutions.

The Bush administration (2001โ2009) and Obama administrations (2009โ2017)
applied banking bailout programs and Keynesian stimulus via high government
deficits, while the Federal Reserve maintained near-zero interest rates. These
measures helped the economy recover, as households paid down debts in
2009โ2012, the only years since 1947 where this occurred, presenting a
significant barrier to recovery. Real GDP regained its pre-crisis (late 2007)
peak by 2011, household net worth by Q2 2012, non-farm payroll jobs by May
2014, and the unemployment rate by September 2015. Each of these variables
continued into post-recession record territory following those dates, with the
U.S. recovery becoming the second longest on record in April 2018.

The Great Recession occurred during the 2008 financial crisis, when GDP fell
by 5.0% from the spring of 2008 to the spring of 2009. Other significant
recessions took place in 1957โ1958, when GDP fell 3.7% following the 1973 oil
crisis, with a 3.1% fall from late 1973 to early 1975, and in the 1981โ1982
recession, when GDP dropped by 2.9%. Recent, mild recessions have included the
1990โ1991 downturn, when output fell by 1.3%, and the 2001 recession, in which
GDP slid by 0.3%; the 2001 downturn lasted just eight months. The most
vigorous, sustained periods of growth, on the other hand, took place from
early 1961 to mid-1969, with an expansion of 53% (5.1% a year), from mid-1991
to late 2000, at 43% (3.8% a year), and from late 1982 to mid-1990, at 37% (4%
a year).

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, has risen throughout the
21st century. Rising from 31% in 2000 to 52% in 2009, and reaching 77% of GDP
in 2017, the U.S. ranked 43rd highest in debt out of 207 countries.

#### COVID-19 pandemic

In the first two quarters of 2020 amid Donald Trump's presidency, the U.S.
economy suffered major setbacks beginning in March 2020, due to the novel
coronavirus and having to "shut-down" major sectors of the American economy.
As of March 2020, US exports of automobiles and industrial machines had
plummeted as a result of the worldwide pandemic. Social distancing measures
which took effect in March 2020, and which negatively impacted the demand for
goods and services, resulted in the US GDP declining at a 4.8% annualized rate
in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the
fourth quarter of 2008. US retails sales dropped a record 8.7% in March alone.
The US airline industry had also been hit hard, seeing a sharp decline in its
revenues. The COVID-19 recession has been widely described as the most severe
global economic downturn since the Great Depression and "far worse" than the
Great Recession.

In May 2020, CNN gave an analysis based on unemployment data that the US
economy was perhaps the worst that it had been since the 1930s. By May 8, the
US had reached a record 14.7 percent unemployment, with 20.5 million jobs lost
in April. The Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, warned that
it may take "an extended time" before the US economy fully recovers from weak
economic growth, due to the pandemic, and that in the foreseeable future the
US can expect "low productivity growth and stagnant incomes". By May 31, 2020,
more than forty million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.

By June 2020, the slump in US continental flights due to the coronavirus
pandemic had resulted in the US government temporarily halting service of
fifteen US airlines to 75 domestic airports. _The New York Times_ reported on
June 10, 2020, that "the United States budget deficit grew to a record $1.88
trillion for the first eight months of this fiscal year."

The US economy recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, growing by 5.7%,
which was its best performance since Ronald Reagan's presidency (1981โ1989).

2021โ2022 marked a historical inflation surge in the United States, with the
Consumer Price Index inflation rate hitting 9.1% higher in June 2022 than June
2021, constituting a 41-year high inflation rate with critics blaming the
Federal Reserve among other factors. Inflation rate reached 4.9% in April
2023, which was roughly 3% above the Federal Reserve's 2% target rate.

U.S. nominal GDP was $19.5 trillion in 2017, the largest in the world.
Annualized, nominal GDP reached $20.1 trillion in Q1 2018, the first time it
exceeded $20 trillion. About 70% of U.S. GDP is personal consumption, with
business investment 18%, government 17% (federal, state and local but
excluding transfer payments such as Social Security, which is in consumption)
and net exports a negative 3% due to the U.S. trade deficit. Real gross
domestic product, a measure of both production and income, grew by 2.3% in
2017, vs. 1.5% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Real GDP grew at a quarterly
annualized rate of 2.2% in Q1 2018, 4.2% in Q2 2018, 3.4% in Q3 2018, and 2.2%
in Q4 2018; the Q2 rate was the best growth rate since Q3 2014, and the
overall yearly GDP growth of 2.9% in 2018 was the best performance of the
economy in a decade. In 2020, the growth rate of the GDP has started to drop
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the GDP shrinking at a
quarterized annual growth rate of โ5.0% in Q1 2020[_citation needed_] and
โ32.9% in Q2 2020,[_citation needed_] respectively.

As of 2014, China passed the U.S. as the largest economy in GDP (PPP) terms,
measured at purchasing power parity conversion rates. The U.S. had the highest
GDP (PPP) figures for more than a century prior to that milestone; China has
more than tripled the U.S. growth rate for each of the past 40 years. As of
2017, the European Union as an aggregate had a GDP roughly 5% larger than the
U.S., although the former is a political union not a country. The United
States', however, remained the world's largest economy with the highest
nominal GDP.

Real GDP per capita (measured in 2009 dollars) was $52,444 in 2017 and has
been growing each year since 2010. It grew 3.0% per year on average in the
1960s, 2.1% in the 1970s, 2.4% in the 1980s, 2.2% in the 1990s, 0.7% in the
2000s, and 0.9% from 2010 to 2017. Reasons for slower growth since 2000 are
debated by economists and may include aging demographics, slower population
and growth in labor force, slower productivity growth, reduced corporate
investment, greater income inequality reducing demand, lack of major
innovations, and reduced labor power. The U.S. ranked 20th out of 220
countries in GDP per capita in 2017. Among the modern U.S. Presidents, Bill
Clinton had the highest cumulative percent real GDP increase during his two
terms, Reagan second and Obama third.

The development of the nation's GDP according to World Bank: U.S. real GDP
grew by an average of 1.7% from 2000 to the first half of 2014, a rate around
half the historical average up to 2000.

economic variables measured annually in 2014โ2017. The years 2014โ2016 were
during President Obama's second term, while 2017 was during President Trump's
term. Refer to citations on detail page.

There were approximately 160.4 million people in the U.S. labor force in 2017,
the fourth largest labor force in the world behind China, India, and the
European Union. The government (federal, state and local) employed 22 million
in 2010. Small businesses are the nation's largest employer, representing 37%
of American workers. The second-largest share of employment belongs to large
businesses employing 36% of the U.S. workforce. White collar workers comprise
44% of the workforce as of 2022, up from 34% in 2000.

The nation's private sector employs 85% of working Americans. Government
accounts for 14% of all U.S. workers. Over 99% of all private employing
organizations in the U.S. are small businesses. The 30 million small
businesses in the U.S. account for 64% of newly created jobs (those created
minus those lost). Jobs in small businesses accounted for 70% of those created
in the last decade.

The proportion of Americans employed by small business versus large business
has remained relatively the same year by year as some small businesses become
large businesses and just over half of small businesses survive for more than
five years. Amongst large businesses, several of the largest companies and
employers in the world are American companies. Amongst them are Walmart, which
is both the largest company and the largest private sector employer in the
world. Walmart employs 2.1 million people worldwide and 1.4 million in the
U.S. alone.

US Census Bureau (number of employees per business) Since the 1970s there has
been a decoupling of U.S. wage gains from worker productivity.

There are nearly thirty million small businesses in the U.S.. Minorities such
as Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans (35% of
the country's population), own 4.1 million of the nation's businesses.
Minority-owned businesses generate almost $700 billion in revenue, and they
employ almost five million workers in the U.S. Americans have the highest
average employee income among OECD nations. The median household income in the
U.S. as of 2008 is $52,029. About 284,000 working people in the U.S. have two
full-time jobs and 7.6 million have part-time ones in addition to their full-
time employments. Out of all working individuals in the U.S., 12% belong to a
labor union and most union members work for the government. The decline of
union membership in the U.S. over the last several decades parallels that of
labor's share of the economy. The World Bank ranks the United States first in
the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is the only advanced
economy that does not legally guarantee its workers paid vacation or paid sick
days, and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family
leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and
Liberia. In 2014 and again in 2020, the International Trade Union
Confederation graded the U.S. a 4 out of 5+, its third-lowest score, on the
subject of workers' rights. Similarly, a 2023 study published by Oxfam found
that the United States ranks among the worst among developed countries for
labor protections. Some scholars, including business theorist Jeffrey Pfeffer
and political scientist Daniel Kinderman, posit that contemporary employment
practices in the United States relating to the increased performance pressure
from management, and the hardships imposed on employees such as toxic working
environments, precarity, and long hours, could be responsible for 120,000
excess deaths annually, making the workplace the fifth leading cause of death
in the United States.

### Unemployment

U1-U6 unemployment rate

As of December 2017, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 4.1% or 6.6 million
people. The government's broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the
part-time underemployed, was 8.1% or 8.2 million people. These figures were
calculated with a civilian labor force of approximately 160.6 million people,
relative to a U.S. population of approximately 327 million people.

Between 2009 and 2010, following the Great Recession, the emerging problem of
jobless recoveries resulted in record levels of long-term unemployment with
more than six million workers looking for work for more than six months as of
January 2010. This particularly affected older workers. A year after the
recession ended in June 2009, immigrants gained 656,000 jobs in the U.S.,
while U.S.-born workers lost more than a million jobs, due in part to an aging
country (relatively more white retirees) and demographic shifts. In April
2010, the official unemployment rate was 9.9%, but the government's broader
U-6 unemployment rate was 17.1%. Between February 2008 and February 2010, the
number of people working part-time for economic reasons (i.e., would prefer to
work full-time) increased by 4.0 million to 8.8 million, an 83% increase in
part-time workers during the two-year period.

By 2013, although the unemployment rate had fallen below 8%, the record
proportion of long term unemployed and continued decreasing household income
remained indicative of a jobless recovery. However, the number of payroll jobs
returned to its pre-recession (November 2007) level by May 2014 as the economy
recovered.

After being higher in the post-war period, the U.S. unemployment rate fell
below the rising eurozone unemployment rate in the mid-1980s and has remained
significantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans
worked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15%
in agriculture. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and
30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male unemployment continued
to be significantly higher than those of females (at 9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009).
The unemployment among Caucasians continues being much lower than those for
African-Americans (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% also in 2009).

The youth unemployment rate was 18.5% in July 2009, the highest rate in that
month since 1948. The unemployment rate of young African Americans was 28.2%
in May 2013.

The unemployment rate reached an all-time high of 14.7% in April 2020 before
falling back to 11.1% in June 2020. Due to the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, Q2 GDP in the US fell 32.9% in 2020. The unemployment rate continued
its rapid decline falling to 3.9% in 2021. It reached 3.7% in May 2023.

### Employment by sector

U.S. employment, as estimated in 2012, is divided into 79.7% in the service
sector, 19.2% in the manufacturing sector, and 1.1% in the agriculture sector.

### Income measures

Real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) median household income, a good measure of
middle-class income, was $59,039 in 2016, a record level. However, it was just
above the previous record set in 1998, indicating the purchasing power of
middle-class family income has been stagnant or down for much of the past
twenty years. During 2013, employee compensation was $8.969 trillion, while
gross private investment totals $2.781 trillion.

Americans have the highest average household income among OECD nations, and in
2010 had the fourth-highest median household income, down from second-highest
in 2007. According to one analysis middle-class incomes in the United States
fell into a tie with those in Canada in 2010, and may have fallen behind by
2014, while several other advanced economies have closed the gap in recent
years.

Income inequality has fluctuated considerably in the United States since
measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s
and 2000s, with a lower level of inequality from approximately 1950-1980 (a
period named the Great Compression), followed by increasing inequality, in
what has been coined as the great divergence.

The U.S. has the highest level of income inequality among its
(post-)industrialized peers. When measured for all households, U.S. income
inequality is comparable to other developed countries before taxes and
transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the
U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower
income households. In 2016, average market income was $15,600 for the lowest
quintile and $280,300 for the highest quintile. The degree of inequality
accelerated within the top quintile, with the top 1% at $1.8 million,
approximately 30 times the $59,300 income of the middle quintile.

The economic and political impacts of inequality may include slower GDP
growth, reduced income mobility, higher poverty rates, greater usage of
household debt leading to increased risk of financial crises, and political
polarization. Causes of inequality may include executive compensation
increasing relative to the average worker, financialization, greater industry
concentration, lower unionization rates, lower effective tax rates on higher
incomes, and technology changes that reward higher educational attainment.

Measurement is debated, as inequality measures vary significantly, for
example, across datasets or whether the measurement is taken based on cash
compensation (market income) or after taxes and transfer payments. The Gini
coefficient is a widely accepted statistic that applies comparisons across
jurisdictions, with a zero indicating perfect equality and 1 indicating
maximum inequality. Further, various public and private data sets measure
those incomes, e.g., from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Internal
Revenue Service, and Census. According to the Census Bureau, income inequality
reached then record levels in 2018, with a Gini of 0.485, Since then the
Census Bureau have given values of 0.488 in 2020 and 0.494 in 2021, per pre-
tax money income.

U.S. tax and transfer policies are progressive and therefore reduce effective
income inequality, as rates of tax generally increase as taxable income
increases. As a group, the lowest earning workers, especially those with
dependents, pay no income taxes and may actually receive a small subsidy from
the federal government (from child credits and the Earned Income Tax Credit).
The 2016 U.S. Gini coefficient was .59 based on market income, but was reduced
to .42 after taxes and transfers, according to Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) figures. The top 1% share of market income rose from 9.6% in 1979 to a
peak of 20.7% in 2007, before falling to 17.5% by 2016. After taxes and
transfers, these figures were 7.4%, 16.6%, and 12.5%, respectively.

### Household net worth and wealth inequality

As of Q4 2017, total household net worth in the United States was a record $99
trillion, an increase of $5.2 trillion from 2016. This increase reflects both
stock market and housing price gains. This measure has been setting records
since Q4 2012. If divided evenly, the $99 trillion represents an average of
$782,000 per household (for about 126.2 million households) or $302,000 per
person. However, median household net worth (i.e., half of the families above
and below this level) was $97,300 in 2016. The bottom 25% of families had a
median net worth of zero, while the 25th to 50th percentile had a median net
worth of $40,000.

Wealth inequality is more unequal than income inequality, with the top 1%
households owning approximately 42% of the net worth in 2012, versus 24% in
1979. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, wealth
inequality is at record highs; the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's
wealth in 2016. The Boston Consulting Group posited in June 2017 report that
1% of the Americans will control 70% of country's wealth by 2021.

The top 10% wealthiest possess 80% of all financial assets. Wealth inequality
in the U.S. is greater than in most developed countries other than Sweden.
Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may
have had a "substantial head start". In September 2012, according to the
Institute for Policy Studies, "over 60 percent" of the Forbes richest 400
Americans "grew up in substantial privilege". Median household wealth fell 35%
in the U.S., from $106,591 to $68,839 between 2005 and 2011, due to the Great
Recession, but has since recovered as indicated above.

About 30% of the entire world's millionaire population resides in the United
States (as of 2009[update]). The Economist Intelligence Unit estimated in 2008
that there were 16,600,000 millionaires in the U.S. Furthermore, 34% of the
world's billionaires are American (in 2011).

### Home ownership

Cost of housing by State

The U.S. home ownership rate in Q1 2018 was 64.2%, well below the all-time
peak of 69.2% set in Q4 2004 during a housing bubble. Millions of homes were
lost to foreclosure during the Great Recession of 2007โ2009, bringing the
ownership rate to a trough of 62.9% in Q2 2016. The average ownership rate
from 1965 to 2017 was 65.3%.

The average home in the United States has more than 700 square feet per person
(65 square meters), which is 50%โ100% more than the average in other high-
income countries. Similarly, ownership rates of gadgets and amenities are
relatively high compared to other countries.

It was reported by Pew Research Center in 2016 that, for the first time in 130
years, Americans aged 18 to 34 are more likely to live with their parents than
in any other housing situation.

In one study by ATTOM Data Solutions, in 70% of the counties surveyed, homes
are increasingly unaffordable for the average U.S. worker.

As of 2018, the number of U.S. citizens residing in their vehicles increased
in major cities with significantly higher than average housing costs such as
Los Angeles, Portland and San Francisco.

According to CNBC, the median sale price for a U.S. home in 2017 was
US$199,200. By February 2023, the median U.S. home sale price grew to
US$392,000 according to Statista. The US has a country-wide housing shortage
caused by insufficient housing construction (which declined severely after the
2008 Great Recession), and has caused rents and home prices to rise to
increasingly unaffordable levels, with one estimate of the shortage being 3.8
million units in 2019, with this shortage having gotten worse during and since
the pandemic.

As of January 2024, in roughly half of cities in the U.S., workers need
incomes of $100,000 or more in order to purchase a home as a result of rising
housing prices and interest rate hikes.

### Profits and wages

Wages in the United States

Nominal wages

Adjusted for inflation wages

Real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) for most workers in the United
States and median incomes have either declined or remained stagnant for the
last twenty to forty years. A 2020 microanalysis demonstrated that in the
preceding four decades labor's share of national output declined while over
the same period the profit share of the same output increased.

In 1970, wages represented more than 51% of the U.S. GDP and profits were less
than 5%. But by 2013, wages had fallen to 44% of the economy, while profits
had more than doubled to 11%. Inflation-adjusted ("real") per capita
disposable personal income rose steadily in the U.S. from 1945 to 2008, but
has since remained generally level.

In 2005, median personal income for those over the age of 18 ranged from
$3,317 for an unemployed, married Asian American female to $55,935 for a full-
time, year-round employed Asian American male. According to the U.S. Census
men tended to have higher income than women while Asians and Whites earned
more than African Americans and Hispanics. The overall median personal income
for all individuals over the age of 18 was $24,062 ($32,140 for those age 25
or above) in the year 2005.

As a reference point, the minimum wage rate in 2009 and 2017 was $7.25 per
hour or $15,080 for the 2080 hours in a typical work year. The minimum wage is
a little more than the poverty level for a single person unit and about 50% of
the poverty level for a family of four.

According to an October 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, real wages
have been flat or falling for the last five decades for most U.S. workers,
regardless of job growth. Bloomberg reported in July 2018 that real GDP per
capita has grown substantially since the Great Recession.

An August 2017 survey by CareerBuilder found that eight out of ten U.S.
workers live paycheck to paycheck. CareerBuilder spokesman Mike Erwin blamed
"stagnant wages and the rising cost of everything from education to many
consumer goods". According to a survey by the federal Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau on the financial well-being of U.S. citizens, roughly half
have trouble paying bills, and more than one third have faced hardships such
as not being able to afford a place to live, running out of food, or not
having enough money to pay for medical care. According to journalist and
author Alissa Quart, the cost of living is rapidly outpacing the growth of
salaries and wages, including those for traditionally secure professions such
as teaching. She writes that "middle-class life is now 30% more expensive than
it was 20 years ago."

In February 2019, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that seven
million U.S. citizens are three months or more behind on their car payments,
setting a record. This is considered a red flag by economists, that Americans
are struggling to pay bills in spite of a low unemployment rate. A May 2019
poll conducted by NPR found that among rural Americans, 40% struggle to pay
for healthcare, food and housing, and 49% could not pay cash for a $1,000
emergency, and would instead choose to borrow in order to pay for such an
unexpected emergency expense. Some experts assert that the US has experienced
a "two-tier recovery", which has benefitted 60% of the population, while the
other 40% on the "lower tier" have been struggling to pay bills as the result
of stagnant wages, increases in the cost of housing, education and healthcare,
and growing debts.

A 2021 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that workers
would have to make at least $24.90 an hour to be able to afford (meaning 30%
of a person's income or less) renting a standard two-bedroom home or $20.40
for a one-bedroom home anywhere in the US. The former is 3.4 times higher than
the current federal minimum wage.

The USCB reported in September 2023 that incomes fell last year by 2.3% from
2021, which is the third consecutive year incomes have declined.

### Poverty

Number in poverty and poverty rate: 1959 to 2016. United States.

Starting in the 1980s relative poverty rates have consistently exceeded those
of other wealthy nations, though analyses using a common data set for
comparisons tend to find that the U.S. has a lower absolute poverty rate by
market income than most other wealthy nations. Extreme poverty in the United
States, meaning households living on less than $2 per day before government
benefits, doubled from 1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011,
including 2.8 million children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high
levels, with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households, about
35% more than 2007 levels. As of 2015, 44 percent of children in the United
States live with low-income families.

In 2016, 12.7% of the U.S. population lived in poverty, down from 13.5% in
2015. The poverty rate rose from 12.5% in 2007 before the Great Recession to a
15.1% peak in 2010, before falling back to just above the 2007 level. In the
1959โ1962 period, the poverty rate was over 20%, but declined to the all-time
low of 11.1% in 1973 following the War on Poverty begun during the Lyndon
Johnson presidency. In June 2016, The IMF warned the United States that its
high poverty rate needs to be tackled urgently.

Wealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013.

The population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods rose by one third from 2000 to
2009. People living in such neighborhoods tend to suffer from inadequate
access to quality education; higher crime rates; higher rates of physical and
psychological ailment; limited access to credit and wealth accumulation;
higher prices for goods and services; and constrained access to job
opportunities. As of 2013, 44% of America's poor are considered to be in "deep
poverty", with an income 50% or more below the government's official poverty
line.

According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual
Homeless Assessment Report, as of 2024[update] there were around 771,480
homeless people in the United States on a given night, or about 23 of every
10,000 people. Almost two thirds stayed in an emergency shelter or
transitional housing program and the other third were living on the street, in
an abandoned building, or another place not meant for human habitation. About
1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency
shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008, and
September 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people are employed. Homelessness
increased from 2016 to 2020, along with deaths among the homeless population.

The United States has one of the least extensive social safety nets in the
developed world, reducing both relative poverty and absolute poverty by
considerably less than the mean for wealthy nations. Some experts posit that
those in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world. A May 2018
report by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights
found that over five million people in the United States live "in 'Third
World' conditions". Poverty is the fourth leading risk factor for premature
death annually, according to a 2023 study published in _JAMA_. Over the last
three decades the poor in America have been incarcerated at a much higher rate
than their counterparts in other developed nations, with penal confinement
being "commonplace for poor men of working age". Some scholars contend that
the shift to neoliberal social and economic policies starting in the late
1970s has expanded the penal state, retrenched the social welfare state,
deregulated the economy and criminalized poverty, ultimately "transforming
what it means to be poor in America".

Sociologist Matthew Desmond writes in his 2023 book _Poverty, by America_ that
the US "offers some of the lowest wages in the industrialized world," which
has "swelled the ranks of the working poor, most of whom are thirty-five or
older." Social scientist Mark Robert Rank asserts that the high rates of
poverty in the U.S. can largely be explained as structural failures at the
economic and political levels.

Two key reasons for more uninsured under President Trump include: 1) Eliminating the individual mandate to have health insurance; and 2) Stopping cost sharing reduction payments. | Parts of this article (those related to uninsured statistics) need to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. _( October 2016)_

### Coverage

The American system is a mix of public and private insurance. The government
provides insurance coverage for approximately 53 million elderly via Medicare,
62 million lower-income persons via Medicaid, and 15 million military veterans
via the Veteran's Administration. About 178 million employed by companies
receive subsidized health insurance through their employer, while 52 million
other persons directly purchase insurance either via the subsidized
marketplace exchanges developed as part of the Affordable Care Act or directly
from insurers. The private sector delivers healthcare services, with the
exception of the Veteran's Administration, where doctors are employed by the
government.

Multiple surveys indicate the number of uninsured fell between 2013 and 2016
due to expanded Medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges
established due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known
as the "ACA" or "Obamacare". According to the United States Census Bureau, in
2012 there were 45.6 million people in the US (14.8% of the under-65
population) who were without health insurance. This figure fell by 18.3
million (40%) to 27.3 million (8.6% of the under-65 population) by 2016.

However, under President Trump these gains in healthcare coverage have begun
to reverse. The Commonwealth Fund estimated in May 2018 that the number of
uninsured increased by four million from early 2016 to early 2018. The rate of
those uninsured increased from 12.7% in 2016 to 15.5%. The impact was greater
among lower-income adults, who had a higher uninsured rate than higher-income
adults. Regionally, the South and West had higher uninsured rates than the
North and East. Further, those 18 states that have not expanded Medicaid had a
higher uninsured rate than those that did.

According to Physicians for a National Health Program, this lack of insurance
causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year. The group's methodology has
been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or
tracking insurance status changes over time, including the time of death. A
2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased
mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for.

### Outcomes

The U.S. lags in overall healthcare performance but is a global leader in
medical innovation. America solely developed or contributed significantly to
nine of the top ten most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by
a 2001 poll of physicians, while the EU and Switzerland together contributed
to five. Since 1966, Americans have received more Nobel Prizes in Medicine
than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money
was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe.

Of 17 high-income countries studied by the National Institutes of Health in
2013, the United States ranked at or near the top in obesity rate, frequency
of automobile use and accidents, homicides, infant mortality rate, incidence
of heart and lung disease, sexually transmitted infections, adolescent
pregnancies, recreational drug or alcohol deaths, injuries, and rates of
disability. Together, such lifestyle and societal factors place the U.S. at
the bottom of that list for life expectancy. On average, a U.S. male can be
expected to live almost four fewer years than those in the top-ranked country,
though Americans who reach age 75 live longer than those who reach that age in
peer nations. One consumption choice causing several of the maladies described
above are cigarettes. Americans smoked 258 billion cigarettes in 2016.
Cigarettes cost the United States $326 billion each year in direct healthcare
costs ($170 billion) and lost productivity ($156 billion).

A comprehensive 2007 study by European doctors found the five-year cancer
survival rate was significantly higher in the U.S. than in all 21 European
nations studied, 66.3% for men versus the European mean of 47.3% and 62.9%
versus 52.8% for women. Americans undergo cancer screenings at significantly
higher rates than people in other developed countries, and access MRI and CT
scans at the highest rate of any OECD nation. People in the U.S. diagnosed
with high cholesterol or hypertension access pharmaceutical treatments at
higher rates than those diagnosed in other developed nations, and are more
likely to successfully control the conditions. Diabetics are more likely to
receive treatment and meet treatment targets in the U.S. than in Canada,
England, or Scotland.

According to a 2018 study of 2016 data by the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation, the U.S. was ranked 27th in the world for healthcare and
education, down from 6th in 1990.

### Cost

U.S. healthcare costs are considerably higher than other countries as a share
of GDP, among other measures. According to the OECD, U.S. healthcare costs in
2015 were 16.9% GDP, over 5% GDP higher than the next most expensive OECD
country. A gap of 5% GDP represents $1 trillion, about $3,000 per person or
one-third higher relative to the next most expensive country.

The high cost of health care in the United States is attributed variously to
technological advance, administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging
more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in
other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact
of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the
full cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical
devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to
receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a
notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more
likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other
countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to
the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are
negotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay
less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the
privately insured through higher prices.

## Composition of economic sectors

A wheat harvest in Idaho

The United States is the world's second-largest manufacturer, with a 2013
industrial output of US$2.4 trillion. Its manufacturing output is greater than
of Germany, France, India, and Brazil combined. Its main industries include
financials, information technology, petroleum, steel, automobiles,
construction machinery, aerospace, agricultural machinery, telecommunications,
chemicals, electronics, food processing, consumer goods, lumber, mining and
armaments.

The U.S. leads the world in airplane manufacturing, which represents a large
portion of U.S. industrial output. American companies such as Boeing, Cessna
(see: Textron), Lockheed Martin (see: Skunk Works), and General Dynamics
produce a majority of the world's civilian and military aircraft in factories
across the United States.

The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has experienced substantial job
losses over the past several years. In January 2004, the number of such jobs
stood at 14.3 million, down by 3.0 million jobs (17.5%) since July 2000 and
about 5.2 million since the historical peak in 1979. Employment in
manufacturing was its lowest since July 1950. The number of steel workers fell
from 500,000 in 1980 to 224,000 in 2000.

Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number
of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of business 'births' and that
the trend continued at least through 2012.

The U.S. produces approximately 18% of the world's manufacturing output, a
share that has declined as other nations developed competitive manufacturing
industries. The job loss during this continual volume growth is the result of
multiple factors including increased productivity, trade, and secular economic
trends. In addition, growth in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, aircraft,
heavy machinery and other industries along with declines in low end, low skill
industries such as clothing, toys, and other simple manufacturing have
resulted in some U.S. jobs being more highly skilled and better paying. There
has been much debate within the United States on whether the decline in
manufacturing jobs are related to American unions, lower foreign wages, or
both.

Products include wheat, corn, other grains, fruits, vegetables, cotton; beef,
pork, poultry, dairy products, forest products, and fish.

Long Beach, The largest ports in the United States

### Transportation

#### Road

The U.S. economy is heavily dependent on road transport for moving people and
goods. Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a
network of four million miles (6.4 million km) of public roads, including one
of the world's longest highway systems at 57,000 miles (91,700 km). The
world's second-largest automobile market, the United States has the highest
rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000
Americans. About 40% of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs, or light trucks.

#### Rail

Mass transit accounts for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by
rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately
31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, partially due to the low
population density throughout much of the nation. However, ridership on
Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37%
between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent
years. The state of California is currently constructing the nation's first
high-speed rail system.

#### Airline

The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely
deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned. The
three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based;
American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by U.S. Airways. Of
the world's thirty busiest passenger airports, twelve are in the United
States, including the busiest, HartsfieldโJackson Atlanta International
Airport.

### Energy

Countries by natural gas proven reserves (2014). The U.S. holds the world's
fourth largest natural gas reserves.

The US is the second-largest energy consumer in total use. The U.S. ranks
seventh in energy consumption per capita after Canada and a number of other
countries. The majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels: in 2005,
it was estimated that 40% of the nation's energy came from petroleum, 23% from
coal, and 23% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 8.4% and renewable
energy supplied 6.8%, which was mainly from hydroelectric dams although other
renewables are included.

American dependence on oil imports grew from 24% in 1970 to 65% by the end of
2005. Transportation has the highest consumption rates, accounting for
approximately 69% of the oil used in the United States in 2006, and 55% of oil
use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report.

In 2013, the United States imported 2.808 billion barrels of crude oil,
compared to 3.377 billion barrels in 2010. While the U.S. is the largest
importer of fuel, _The Wall Street Journal_ reported in 2011 that the country
was about to become a net fuel exporter for the first time in 62 years. The
paper reported expectations that this would continue until 2020. In fact,
petroleum was the major export from the country in 2011.

### Telecommunications

The Internet was developed in the U.S. and the country hosts many of the
world's largest hubs.

## International trade

Protectionist measures since 2008 by country

The United States is the world's second-largest trading nation. There is a
large amount of U.S. dollars in circulation all around the planet; about 60%
of funds used in international trade are U.S. dollars. The dollar is also used
as the standard unit of currency in international markets for commodities such
as gold and petroleum.

The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, created one of the largest
trade blocs in the world in 1994.

Since 1976, the U.S. has sustained merchandise trade deficits with other
nations, and since 1982, current account deficits. The nation's long-standing
surplus in its trade in services was maintained, however, and reached a record
US$231 billion in 2013.

The U.S. trade deficit increased from $502 billion in 2016 to $552 billion in
2017, an increase of $50 billion or 10%. During 2017, total imports were $2.90
trillion, while exports were $2.35 trillion. The net deficit in goods was $807
billion, while the net surplus in services was $255 billion.

Americas ten largest trading partners are China, Canada, Mexico, Japan,
Germany, South Korea, United Kingdom, France, India and Taiwan. The goods
trade deficit with China rose from $347 billion in 2016 to $376 billion in
2017, an increase of $30 billion or 8%. In 2017, the U.S. had a goods trade
deficit of $71 billion with Mexico and $17 billion with Canada.

According to the KOF index of globalization[_clarification needed_] and the
globalization index by A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy Magazine, the U.S. has a
relatively high degree of globalization.[_citation needed_] U.S. workers send
a third of all remittances in the world.

## Financial position

The amount of U.S. public debt, measured as a percentage of GDP, held by the
public since 1900

The U.S. public debt was $909 billion in 1980, an amount equal to 33% of
America's gross domestic product (GDP); by 1990, that number had more than
tripled to $3.2 trillion โ 56% of GDP. In 2001 the national debt was $5.7
trillion; however, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained at 1990 levels. Debt levels
rose quickly in the following decade, and on January 28, 2010, the U.S. debt
ceiling was raised to $14.3 trillion. Based on the 2010 United States federal
budget, total national debt will grow to nearly 100% of GDP, versus a level of
approximately 80% in early 2009. The White House estimates that the
government's tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700 billion a year in
2019, up from $202 billion in 2009.

U.S. household and non-profit net worth exceeded $100 trillion for the first
time in Q1 2018; it has been setting records since Q4 2012. The U.S. federal
government or "national debt" was $21.1 trillion in May 2018, just over 100%
GDP. Using a subset of the national debt called "debt held by the public",
U.S. debt was approximately 77% GDP in 2017. By this measure, the U.S. ranked
43rd highest among 2017 nations. Debt held by the public rose considerably as
a result of the Great Recession and its aftermath. It is expected to continue
rising as the country ages towards 100% GDP by 2028. In February 2024, the
total federal government debt grew to $34.4 trillion after having grown by
approximately $1 trillion in both of two separate 100-day periods since the
previous June.

The U.S. Treasury statistics indicate that, at the end of 2006, non-US
citizens and institutions held 44% of federal debt held by the public. As of
2014[update], China, holding $1.26 trillion in treasury bonds, is the largest
foreign financier of the U.S. public debt.

The overall financial position of the United States as of 2014 includes $269.6
trillion of assets owned by households, businesses, and governments within its
borders, representing more than 15.7 times the annual gross domestic product
of the United States. Debts owed during this same period amounted to $145.8
trillion, about 8.5 times the annual gross domestic product.

Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates
on government debt. Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate, occur when
the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk,
or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies,
pensions, or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or
choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge
against risk. American economist Lawrence Summers argues that at such low
rates, government debt borrowing saves taxpayer money, and improves
creditworthiness.

In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their
debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of
negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt
rates will continue to stay so low. In January 2012, the U.S. Treasury
Borrowing Advisory Committee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association unanimously recommended that government debt be allowed to auction
even lower, at negative absolute interest rates.

## Currency and central bank

The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the United States.

The United States dollar is the unit of currency of the United States. The
U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions. Several
countries use it as their official currency, and in many others it is the de
facto currency.

The federal government attempts to use both monetary policy (control of the
money supply through mechanisms such as changes in interest rates) and fiscal
policy (taxes and spending) to maintain low inflation, high economic growth,
and low unemployment. An independent central bank, known as the Federal
Reserve, was formed in 1913 to provide a stable currency and monetary policy.
The U.S. dollar has been regarded as one of the more stable currencies in the
world and many nations back their own currency with U.S. dollar reserves.

The U.S. dollar has maintained its position as the world's primary reserve
currency, although it is gradually being challenged in that role. Almost two
thirds of currency reserves held around the world are held in U.S. dollars,
compared to around 25% for the next most popular currency, the euro. Rising
U.S. national debt and quantitative easing has caused some to predict that the
U.S. dollar will lose its status as the world's reserve currency; however,
these predictions have not yet come to fruition.

## Climate change

At least 72% of Chinese, American and European respondents to a 2020โ2021
European Investment Bank climate survey stated that climate change had an
impact on everyday life.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment states that climate change impacts
communities over all the territory of the United States. The impacts differ
from state to state. The human and economic toll is high. Scientists now can
say with relatively high confidence how much climate change impacted a
specific meteorological event. The impacts mentioned in the report include,
increase in frequency and magnitude of heat waves, droughts, floods,
hurricanes and more.

An article in _Science_ predicts that the Southern states, such as Texas,
Florida, and the Deep South will be economically affected by climate change
more severely than northern states (some of which would even gain benefits),
but that economic impacts of climate change would likely exacerbate
preexisting economic inequality in the country. In September 2020, a
subcommittee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a report that
concluded that climate change poses systemic risks to the U.S. financial
system, while the Financial Stability Oversight Council released a report in
October 2021 that identified climate change as an emerging and increasing
threat to the stability of the U.S. financial system.

A 2021 survey of 1,422 members of the American Economic Association found that
86 percent of professional economists generally agreed with the statement:
"Climate change poses a major risk to the US economy." In September 2023, the
U.S. Treasury Department issued a report in consultation with the Financial
Literacy and Education Commission found that 13% of Americans experienced
financial hardship in 2022 due to the effects of climate change after $176
billion in weather disasters. In April 2024, Consumer Reports announced the
release of a report commissioned from ICF International that estimated that
climate change could cost Americans born in 2024 nearly $500,000 over their
lifetimes.

## Corruption

In 2019, the United States was ranked 23rd on the Transparency International
Corruption Perceptions Index with a score of 69 out of 100. This is a decrease
from its score in 2018 which was 71 out of 100.

## Law and government

The United States ranked 4th in the ease of doing business index in 2012, 18th
in the Economic Freedom of the World index by the Fraser Institute in 2012,
10th in the Index of Economic Freedom by _The Wall Street Journal_ and The
Heritage Foundation in 2012, 15th in the 2014 Global Enabling Trade Report,
and 3rd on the Global Competitiveness Report.

According to the 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, released by _The Wall Street
Journal_ and The Heritage Foundation, the U.S. has dropped out of the top ten
most economically free countries. The U.S. has been on a steady seven-year
economic freedom decline and is the only country to do so. The index measures
each nation's commitment to free enterprise on a scale of 0 to 100. Countries
losing economic freedom and receiving low index scores are at risk of economic
stagnation, high unemployment rates, and diminishing social conditions. The
2014 Index of Economic Freedom gave the United States a score of 75.5 and is
listed as the twelfth-freest economy in world. It dropped two rankings and its
score is half a point lower than in 2013.

Economist Alan S. Blinder criticizes democratic government regulation of the
U.S. economy as too short-sighted (targeting either the next election or the
next news cycle rather than making difficult choices that favor long-term
benefits despite short-term pain) and favoring policies that sound good and
avoiding those that sound bad, regardless of merit when examined rigorously by
economists.

### Regulations

Number of countries having a banking crisis in each year since 1800. This is
based on _This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly_ which
covers only seventy countries. The general upward trend might be attributed to
many factors. One of these is a gradual increase in the percent of people who
receive money for their labor. The dramatic feature of this graph is the
virtual absence of banking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods
agreement, 1945 to 1971. This analysis is similar to Figure 10.1 in Reinhart
and Rogoff (2009). For more details see the help file for "bankingCrises" in
the Ecdat package available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

The U.S. federal government regulates private enterprise in numerous ways.
Regulation falls into two general categories.

Some efforts seek, either directly or indirectly, to control prices.
Traditionally, the government has sought to create state-regulated monopolies
such as electric utilities while allowing prices in the level that would
ensure them normal profits. At times, the government has extended economic
control to other kinds of industries as well. In the years following the Great
Depression, it devised a complex system to stabilize prices for agricultural
goods, which tend to fluctuate wildly in response to rapidly changing supply
and demand. A number of other industriesโtrucking and, later,
airlinesโsuccessfully sought regulation themselves to limit what they
considered as harmful price-cutting, a process called regulatory capture.

Another form of economic regulation, antitrust law, seeks to strengthen market
forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary. The governmentโand,
sometimes, private partiesโhave used antitrust law to prohibit practices or
mergers that would unduly limit competition.

Bank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared to other
G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S.,
banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. The U.S. also has
one of the most highly regulated banking environments in the world; however,
many of the regulations are not soundness related, but are instead focused on
privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism,
anti-usury lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.

Since the 1970s, government has also exercised control over private companies
to achieve social goals, such as improving the public's health and safety or
maintaining a healthy environment. For example, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration provides and enforces standards for workplace safety,
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency provides standards and
regulations to maintain air, water, and land resources. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration regulates what drugs may reach the market, and also provides
standards of disclosure for food products.

American attitudes about regulation changed substantially during the final
three decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1970s, policy makers grew
increasingly convinced that economic regulation protected companies at the
expense of consumers in industries such as airlines and trucking. At the same
time, technological changes spawned new competitors in some industries, such
as telecommunications, that once were considered natural monopolies. Both
developments led to a succession of laws easing regulation.

While leaders of America's two most influential political parties generally
favored economic deregulation during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, there was
less agreement concerning regulations designed to achieve social goals. Social
regulation had assumed growing importance in the years following the
Depression and World War II, and again in the 1960s and 1970s. During the
1980s, the government relaxed labor, consumer and environmental rules based on
the idea that such regulation interfered with free enterprise, increased the
costs of doing business, and thus contributed to inflation. The response to
such changes is mixed; many Americans continued to voice concerns about
specific events or trends, prompting the government to issue new regulations
in some areas, including environmental protection.

Where legislative channels have been unresponsive, some citizens have turned
to the courts to address social issues more quickly. For instance, in the
1990s, individuals, and eventually the government itself, sued tobacco
companies over the health risks of cigarette smoking. The 1998 Tobacco Master
Settlement Agreement provided states with long-term payments to cover medical
costs to treat smoking-related illnesses.

Between 2000 and 2008, economic regulation in the United States saw the most
rapid expansion since the early 1970s. The number of new pages in the Federal
Registry, a proxy for economic regulation, rose from 64,438 new pages in 2001
to 78,090 in new pages in 2007, a record amount of regulation. Economically
significant regulations, defined as regulations which cost more than $100
million a year, increased by 70%. Spending on regulation increased by 62% from
$26.4 billion to $42.7 billion.

### Taxation

Taxation in the United States is a complex system which may involve payment to
at least four different levels of government and many methods of taxation.
Taxes are levied by the federal government, by the state governments, and
often by local governments, which may include counties, municipalities,
township, school districts, and other special-purpose districts, which include
fire, utility, and transit districts.

Forms of taxation include taxes on income, property, sales, imports, payroll,
estates and gifts, as well as various fees. When taxation by all government
levels taken into consideration, the total taxation as percentage of GDP was
approximately a quarter of GDP in 2011. Share of black market in the U.S.
economy is very low compared to other countries.

Although a federal wealth tax is prohibited by the United States Constitution
unless the receipts are distributed to the States by their populations, state
and local government property tax amount to a wealth tax on real estate, and
because capital gains are taxed on nominal instead of inflation-adjusted
profits, the capital gains tax amounts to a wealth tax on the inflation rate.

U.S. taxation is generally progressive, especially at the federal level, and
is among the most progressive in the developed world. There is debate over
whether taxes should be more or less progressive.

According to the Tax Justice Network in 2022, the US fuels more global
financial secrecy than Switzerland, Cayman and Bermuda combined.

### Expenditure

CBO: U.S. Federal spending and revenue components for fiscal year 2023. Major
expenditure categories are healthcare, Social Security, and defense; income
and payroll taxes are the primary revenue sources. Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) baseline scenario comparisons: June 2017 (essentially the deficit
trajectory that President Trump inherited from President Obama), April 2018
(which reflects Trump's tax cuts and spending bills), and April 2018 alternate
scenario (which assumes extension of the Trump tax cuts, among other current
policy extensions).

The United States public-sector spending amounts to about 38% of GDP (federal
is around 21%, state and local the remainder). Each level of government
provides many direct services. The federal government, for example, is
responsible for national defense, research that often leads to the development
of new products, conducts space exploration, and runs numerous programs
designed to help workers develop workplace skills and find jobs (including
higher education). Government spending has a significant effect on local and
regional economies, and on the overall pace of economic activity.

State governments, meanwhile, are responsible for the construction and
maintenance of most highways. State, county, or city governments play the
leading role in financing and operating public schools. Local governments are
primarily responsible for police and fire protection. In 2016, U.S. state and
local governments owed $3 trillion and have another $5 trillion in unfunded
liabilities.

The welfare system in the United States began in the 1930s, during the Great
Depression, with the passage of the New Deal. The welfare system was later
expanded in the 1960s through Great Society legislation, which included
Medicare, Medicaid, the Older Americans Act and federal education funding.

Overall, federal, state, and local spending accounted for almost 28% of gross
domestic product in 1998.

### Federal budget and debt

During FY2017, the federal government spent $3.98 trillion on a budget or cash
basis, up $128 billion or 3.3% vs. FY2016 spending of $3.85 trillion. Major
categories of FY 2017 spending included: Healthcare such as Medicare and
Medicaid ($1,077B or 27% of spending), Social Security ($939B or 24%), non-
defense discretionary spending used to run federal Departments and Agencies
($610B or 15%), Defense Department ($590B or 15%), and interest ($263B or 7%).

During FY2017, the federal government collected approximately $3.32 trillion
in tax revenue, up $48 billion or 1.5% versus FY2016. Primary receipt
categories included individual income taxes ($1,587 billion or 48% of total
receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,162 billion or 35%), and
corporate taxes ($297 billion or 9%). Other revenue types included excise,
estate and gift taxes. FY 2017 revenues were 17.3% of gross domestic product
(GDP), versus 17.7% in FY 2016. Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP
over the 1980โ2017 period.

The federal budget deficit (i.e., expenses greater than revenues) was $665
billion in FY2017, versus $585 billion in 2016, an increase of $80 billion or
14%. The budget deficit was 3.5% GDP in 2017, versus 3.2% GDP in 2016. The
budget deficit is forecast to rise to $804 billion in FY 2018, due
significantly to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other spending bills. An aging
country and healthcare inflation are other drivers of deficits and debt over
the long-run.

Debt held by the public, a measure of national debt, was approximately $14.7
trillion or 77% of GDP in 2017, ranked the 43rd highest out of 207 countries.
This debt, as a percent of GDP, is roughly equivalent to those of many western
European nations.

## Business culture

A central feature of the U.S. economy is the economic freedom afforded to the
private sector by allowing the private sector to make the majority of economic
decisions in determining the direction and scale of what the U.S. economy
produces. This is enhanced by relatively low levels of regulation and
government involvement, as well as a court system that generally protects
property rights and enforces contracts. Today, the United States is home to
29.6 million small businesses, thirty percent of the world's millionaires,
forty percent of the world's billionaires, and 139 of the world's 500 largest
companies.

From its emergence as an independent nation, the United States has encouraged
science and innovation. In the early 20th century, the research developed
through informal cooperation between U.S. industry and academia grew rapidly
and by the late 1930s exceeded the size of that taking place in Britain
(although the quality of U.S. research was not yet on par with British and
German research at the time). After World War II, federal spending on defense
R&D and antitrust policy played a significant role in U.S. innovation.

The United States is rich in mineral resources and fertile farm soil, and it
is fortunate to have a moderate climate. It also has extensive coastlines on
both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as on the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers
flow from far within the continent and the Great Lakes (the five large inland
lakes along the Canadian border) provide additional shipping access. These
extensive waterways have helped shape the country's economic growth over the
years and helped bind America's fifty individual states together in a single
economic unit.

The number of workers and, more importantly, their productivity help determine
the health of the U.S. economy. Consumer spending in the U.S. rose to about
62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to
71% in 2013. Throughout its history, the United States has experienced steady
growth in the labor force, a phenomenon that is both cause and effect of
almost constant economic expansion. Until shortly after World War I, most
workers were immigrants from Europe, their immediate descendants, or African
Americans who were mostly slaves taken from Africa, or their descendants.

## Demographic shift

Beginning in the late 20th century, many Latin Americans immigrated, followed
by large numbers of Asians after the removal of nation-origin based
immigration quotas. The promise of high wages brings many highly skilled
workers from around the world to the United States, as well as millions of
illegal immigrants seeking work in the informal economy. More than 13 million
people officially entered the United States during the 1990s alone.

Restaurants and shops in Chinatown, Philadelphia

Labor mobility has also been important to the capacity of the American economy
to adapt to changing conditions. When immigrants flooded labor markets on the
East Coast, many workers moved inland, often to farmland waiting to be tilled.
Similarly, economic opportunities in industrial, northern cities attracted
black Americans from southern farms in the first half of the 20th century, in
what was known as the Great Migration.

In the United States, the corporation has emerged as an association of owners,
known as stockholders, who form a business enterprise governed by a complex
set of rules and customs. Brought on by the process of mass production,
corporations, such as General Electric, have been instrumental in shaping the
United States. Today in the era of globalization, American investors and
corporations have influence all over the world. The American government is
also included among the major investors in the American economy. Government
investments have been directed towards public works of scale (such as from the
Hoover Dam), military-industrial contracts, and the financial industry.

### Aging

The U.S. population is aging, which has significant economic implications for
GDP growth, productivity, innovation, inequality, and national debt, according
to several studies. The average worker in 2019 was aged 42, vs. 38 in 2000. By
2030, about 59% of adults over 16 will be in the labor force, vs. 62% in 2015.
One study estimated that aging since 2000 has reduced productivity between
0.25% and 0.7% per year. Since GDP growth is a function of productivity
(output per worker) and the number of workers, both trends slow the GDP growth
rate. Older workers save more, which pushes interests rates down, offsetting
some of the GDP growth reduction but reducing the Federal Reserve's ability to
address a recession by lowering interest rates. Means of addressing the aging
trend include immigration (which theoretically brings in younger workers) and
higher fertility rates, which can be encouraged by incentives to have more
children (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies, and more generous paid leave).

The Congressional Budget Office estimated in May 2019 that mandatory spending
(e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security) will continue growing relative
to the size of the economy (GDP) as the population ages. The population aged
65 or older is projected to rise by one-third from 2019โ2029. Mandatory
program spending (outlays) in 2019 were 12.7% of GDP and are projected to
average 14.4% GDP from 2025โ2029.

## Entrepreneurship

Percent of U.S. economy from state-owned enterprises or government-sponsored
enterprises. Tennessee in 1897. The U.S. was a leader in the adoption of
electric lighting.

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late
19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. In 1876,
Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone.
Thomas Edison's laboratory developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting
light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. Edison's company would also
pioneer (direct current based) electric power delivery and market it around
the world, followed on by companies such as Westinghouse Electric Corporation
which would rapidly develop alternating current power delivery. In the early
20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford
popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first
sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.

Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are two of the most well-known American
entrepreneurs.

American society highly emphasizes entrepreneurship and business.
Entrepreneurship is the act of being an entrepreneur, which can be defined as
"one who undertakes innovations, finance and business acumen in an effort to
transform innovations into economic goods". This may result in new
organizations or may be part of revitalizing mature organizations in response
to a perceived opportunity. American entrepreneurs are even engaged in public
services delivery through public-private partnerships.

The most obvious form of entrepreneurship refers to the process and engagement
of starting new businesses (referred to as startup companies); however, in
recent years, the term has been extended to include social and political forms
of entrepreneurial activity. When entrepreneurship is describing activities
within a firm or large organization it is referred to as intra-preneurship and
may include corporate venturing, when large entities spin-off organizations.

According to Paul Reynolds, entrepreneurship scholar and creator of the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor, "by the time they reach their retirement years, half
of all working men in the United States probably have a period of self-
employment of one or more years; one in four may have engaged in self-
employment for six or more years. Participating in a new business creation is
a common activity among U.S. workers over the course of their careers." And in
recent years, business creation has been documented by scholars such as David
Audretsch to be a major driver of economic growth in both the United States
and Western Europe.[_citation needed_]

## Venture capital investment

Quarterly U.S. venture capital investments, 1995โ2017

Venture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, which it
still dominates. According to the National Venture Capital Association 11% of
private sector jobs come from venture capital backed companies and venture
capital backed revenue accounts for 21% of U.S. GDP.

Total U.S. investment in venture capital amounted to $48.3 billion in 2014,
for 4,356 deals. This represented "an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4%
increase in deals over the prior year", reported the National Venture Capital
Association. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully
recovered by 2014 to pre-recession levels. The National Venture Capital
Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life
sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion
was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789
deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two thirds (68%) of the
investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals
and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage
companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%). However, it was the software
industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1,799, for an
investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies,
garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1,005 deals. Many of these
companies are based in the state of California, which alone concentrates 28%
of U.S. research.

Some new American businesses raise investments from angel investors (venture
capitalists). In 2010 healthcare/medical accounted for the largest share of
angel investments, with 30% of total angel investments (vs. 17% in 2009),
followed by software (16% vs. 19% in 2007), biotech (15% vs. 8% in 2009),
industrial/energy (8% vs. 17% in 2009), retail (5% vs. 8% in 2009) and IT
services (5%). [_clarification needed_]

Americans are "venturesome consumers" who are unusually willing to try new
products of all sorts, and to pester manufacturers to improve their products.

## Mergers and acquisitions

Since 1985 there have been three major waves of M&A in the U.S. (see graph
"Mergers and Acquisitions in the U.S. since 1985"). 2017 has been the most
active year in terms of number of deals (12,914), whereas 2015 cumulated to
the biggest overall value of deals ($24 billion).

The biggest merger deal in U.S. history was the acquisition of Time Warner by
America Online Inc. in 2000, where the bid was over $164 billion. Since 2000
acquisitions of U.S. companies by Chinese investors increased by 368%. The
other way roundโU.S. companies acquiring Chinese Companiesโshowed a decrease
of 25%, with a short upwards trend until 2007.

## Research and development

Report: towards 2030

The U.S. invests more funds in research and development (R&D) in absolute
terms than the other G7 nations combined: 17.2% more in 2012. Since 2000,
gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) in the U.S. has increased by 31.2%,
enabling it to maintain its share of GERD among the G7 nations at 54.0% (54.2%
in 2000).

R&D by country

### Impact of recession on research spending

Generally speaking, U.S. investment in R&D rose with the economy in the first
years of the century before receding slightly during the economic recession
then rising again as growth resumed. At its peak in 2009, GERD amounted to
US$406 billion (2.82% of GDP). Despite the recession, it was still at 2.79% in
2012 and will slide only marginally to 2.73% in 2013, according to provisional
data, and should remain at a similar level in 2014.

The federal government is the primary funder of basic research, at 52.6% in
2012; state governments, universities and other non-profits funded 26%.
Experimental development, on the other hand, is primarily funded by industry:
76.4% to the federal government's 22.1% in 2012.

World shares of GDP, research spending, researchers and scientific
publications, 2009 and 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030,
Figure 1.7

While U.S. investment in R&D is high, it failed to reach President Obama's
target of 3% of GDP by the end of his presidency in 2016. Between 2009 and
2012, the United States' world share of research expenditure receded slightly
from 30.5% to 28.1%. Several countries now devote more than 4% of GDP to R&D
(Israel, Japan and the Republic of Korea) and others plan to raise their own
GERD/GDP ratio to 4% by 2020 (Finland and Sweden).

### Business spending on research

Business enterprises contributed 59.1 % of U.S. GERD in 2012, down from 69.0 %
in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute a small
fraction of total R&D, 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively.

UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, Figure 5.4, based on data from American
Association for the Advancement of Science

The United States has historically been a leader in business R&D and
innovation. The economic recession of 2008โ2009 has had a lasting impact,
however. While the major performers of R&D largely maintained their
commitments, the pain of the U.S. recession was felt mainly by small
businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau showed
that, in 2008, the number of business 'deaths' began overtaking the number of
business 'births' and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From
2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward
trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the
previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1โ2% this time. Companies in high-
opportunity industries like health care cut back less than those in more
mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R&D spending
were in agriculture production: โ3.5% compared to the average R&D to net sales
ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment
industry, on the other hand, showed R&D to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and
4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R&D spending increased in
2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth
rate of business-funded R&D had recovered. Whether this continues will be
contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal
research funding and the general business climate.

### Research spending at the state level

The level of research spending varies considerably from one state to another.
Six states (New Mexico, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, California and
Michigan) each devoted 3.9% or more of their GDP to R&D in 2010, together
contributing 42% of national research expenditure. In 2010, more than one
quarter of R&D was concentrated in California (28.1%), ahead of Massachusetts
(5.7%), New Jersey (5.6%), Washington State (5.5%), Michigan (5.4%), Texas
(5.2%), Illinois (4.8%), New York (3.6%) and Pennsylvania (3.5%). Seven states
(Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, Louisiana, South Dakota and Wyoming) devoted less
than 0.8% of GDP to R&D.

towards 2030, Figure 5.6, based on data from American Association for the
Advancement of Science San Francisco is one of the world's largest financial
centers.

California is home to Silicon Valley, the name given to the area hosting the
leading corporations and start-ups in information technology. This state also
hosts dynamic biotechnology clusters in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los
Angeles and San Diego. The main biotechnology clusters outside California are
the cities of Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, Maryland, suburban Washington,
DC, New York, Seattle, Philadelphia, and Chicago. California supplies 13.7% of
all jobs in science and engineering across the country, more than any other
state. Some 5.7% of Californians are employed in these fields. This high share
reflects a potent combination of academic excellence and a strong business
focus on R&D: the prestigious Stanford University and University of California
rub shoulders with Silicon Valley, for instance. In much the same way, Route
128 around Boston in the state of Massachusetts is not only home to numerous
high-tech firms and corporations but also hosts the renowned Harvard
University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

New Mexico's high research intensity can be explained by the fact that it
hosts the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Maryland's position may reflect the
concentration of federally funded research institutions there. Washington
State has a high concentration of high-tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon and
Boeing and the engineering functions of most automobile manufacturers are
located in the state of Michigan.

### Research spending by multinational corporations

The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United
States offer tax credits to particular industries and companies to encourage
them to engage in research and development (R&D). Congress usually renews a
tax credit every few years. According to a survey by _The Wall Street Journal_
in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making decisions about
investing in R&D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.

In 2014, four U.S. multinational corporations figured in the Top 50 for the
volume of expenditure on R&D: Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson and Google.
Several have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft,
Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included in this table for the
first time in 2013.

database

Until 2010, the United States was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals but, since
2011, it has become a net importer of these goods.

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products
far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled
workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the
license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific
industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned
with the licensing of intellectual property rights.

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains
unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in
2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of
$31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual
property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4
billion).

## Notable companies and markets

A typical Walmart discount department store (location: Laredo, Texas)

America's largest companies are ranked every year by revenue in the _Fortune
500_. Between 2000 and 2022's edition of the list, the top spot on the Fortune
500 was occupied by either the auto manufacturer General Motors (GM), the oil
and gas giant ExxonMobil, or the retailer Walmart. The US is also home of many
of the world's largest companies by market capitalization; As of February 9,
2023[update], the largest American companies by market cap are Apple,
Microsoft, Google (through holding company Alphabet), Amazon, Berkshire
Hathaway, Tesla, Nvidia, Visa, ExxonMobil, and Meta Platforms. Moreover, many
of these companies are the most valuable brands, with many of the largest
companies by revenue and market cap on the annual ranking of most valuable
brands by Forbes being joined by Coca-Cola, The Walt Disney Company, and
McDonald's.

Some industries within America are defined by a few major companies, often
deriving terms such as "Big Three" or "Big Four". Examples of this phenomenon
include the Big Three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and
TransUnion), the Big Three automobile makers (Ford, General Motors, and
Stellantis), the Big Four accounting firms (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and
PwC), and the Big Four communications carriers (Verizon, AT&T,
T-Mobile/Sprint, and Dish Network). The American energy industry is among the
largest and consists of large companies in oil, natural gas, coal, and
renewable energy sources. America's largest energy companies by market are in
oil and gas, with ExxonMobil being joined by Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and
Schlumberger; British oil companies BP and Shell also have significant
presence in the United States and trade on both the London Stock Exchange and
New York Stock Exchange. Many large American petroleum companies, as well as
BP, can trace some origin back to Standard Oil, a former monopoly run by John
D. Rockefeller. In coal, the $30 billion industry is dominated by Peabody
Energy, which is the largest coal company in the world with almost $23 billion
in revenue for 2021. Much of the nation's coal mining occurs in Wyoming and
Appalachian states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.

A 2012 Deloitte report published in _STORES_ magazine indicated that of the
world's top 250 largest retailers by retail sales revenue in fiscal year 2010,
32% of those retailers were based in the United States, and those 32%
accounted for 41% of the total retail sales revenue of the top 250.

America is the foremost country in the world when it comes to semiconductor
production. In 2011, half of the world's 20 largest semiconductor
manufacturers by sales were based in America. More recently, Congress under
the presidency of Joe Biden passed a bipartisan bill, the CHIPS and Science
Act, which bolstered semiconductor production. Some of America's largest
semiconductor firms and chip companies are Broadcom, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm.

Many of the United States' largest firms by market cap are technology
companies. These companies are dominated by the Big Five tech giants (Apple,
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta), though numerous software firms also
dominate the American technology industry. These firms range from hardware
manufacturers like Dell Technologies, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Cisco, to
software and computing infrastructure programmers like Oracle, Salesforce,
Adobe, and Intuit.

In film, American producers create nearly all of the world's highest-grossing
films. Many of the world's best-selling music artists are based in the United
States. Some of America's largest media companies are The Walt Disney Company,
Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix, Comcast, Paramount Global, and Fox.

## Finance

The New York Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange in the world.

Measured by value of its listed companies' securities, the New York Stock
Exchange is more than three times larger than any other stock exchange in the
world. As of October 2008, the combined capitalization of all domestic NYSE
listed companies was US$10.1 trillion. NASDAQ is another American stock
exchange and the world's third-largest exchange after the New York Stock
Exchange and Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange. However, NASDAQ's trade value is
larger than Japan's TSE. NASDAQ is the largest electronic screen-based equity
securities trading market in the U.S. With approximately 3,800 companies and
corporations, it has more trading volume per hour than any other stock
exchange.

Because of the influential role that the U.S. stock market plays in
international finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets
that in the short run, stocks that affect the willingness to bear risk
independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most of the variation in
the U.S. stock market. In the long run, the U.S. stock market is profoundly
affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production
between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks, however, play a small
role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the U.S. stock
market.

The U.S. finance industry comprised only 10% of total non-farm business
profits in 1947, but it grew to 50% by 2010. Over the same period, finance
industry income as a proportion of GDP rose from 2.5% to 7.5%, and the finance
industry's proportion of all corporate income rose from 10% to 20%. The mean
earnings per employee hour in finance relative to all other sectors has
closely mirrored the share of total U.S. income earned by the top 1% income
earners since 1930. The mean salary in New York City's finance industry rose
from $80,000 in 1981 to $360,000 in 2011, while average New York City salaries
rose from $40,000 to $70,000. In 1988, there were about 12,500 U.S. banks with
less than $300 million in deposits, and about 900 with more deposits, but by
2012, there were only 4,200 banks with less than $300 million in deposits in
the U.S., and over 1,800 with more.

A 2012 International Monetary Fund study concluded that the U.S. financial
sector has grown so large that it is slowing economic growth. New York
University economist Thomas Philippon supported those findings, estimating
that the U.S. spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and
that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of
Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers in research and
development add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry
workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar they are paid. A
study by the Bank for International Settlements reached similar conclusions,
saying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and
development based industries.
