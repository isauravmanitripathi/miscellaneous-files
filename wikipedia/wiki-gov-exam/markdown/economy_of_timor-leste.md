The **economy of Timor-Leste** is a lower-middle income economy as ranked by
the World Bank. It is placed 140th on the Human Development Index, indicating
a medium level of human development. 20% of the population is unemployed, and
52.9% live on less than $1.25 a day. About half of the population is
illiterate. At 27%, Timor-Leste's urbanisation rate is one of the lowest in
the world.

In 2007, a bad harvest caused a "major food crisis" in Timor-Leste. By
November, eleven sub-districts still needed food supplied by international
aid.

According to data gathered in the 2010 census, 87.7% of urban and 18.9% of
rural households have electricity, for an overall average of 36.7%.

## History

Prior to and during colonisation, the island of Timor was best known for its
sandalwood. The Portuguese colonial administration also granted concessions to
Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop oil and gas deposits. However, this
was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976.

Petrochemical resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the
Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. The treaty established guidelines for joint
exploitation of seabed resources in the area of the "gap" left by then-
Portuguese Timor in the maritime boundary agreed between the two countries in
1972. Revenues from the "joint" area were to be divided 50-50. Woodside
Petroleum and ConocoPhillips began development of some resources in the Timor
Gap on behalf of the two governments in 1992.

In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was
destroyed by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias, and 260,000
people fled westward. From 2002 to 2005, an international program led by the
United Nations, manned by civilian advisers, 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at
peak) and 1,300 police officers, substantially reconstructed the
infrastructure. By mid-2002, all but about 50,000 of the refugees had
returned.

The economy grew by about 10% in 2011 and at a similar rate in 2012.

While Timor-Leste gained revenue from offshore oil and gas reserves, little of
it has been spent on the development of villages, which still rely on
subsistence farming. As of 2012[update], nearly half the East Timorese
population was living in extreme poverty.

## Industries

In the Doing Business 2013 report by the World Bank, Timor-Leste was ranked
169th overall and last in the East Asia and Pacific region. The country fared
particularly poorly in the "registering property", "enforcing contracts", and
"resolving insolvency" categories, ranking last worldwide in all three. In
2020 it ranked 181st. There are no patent laws in Timor-Leste.

Regarding telecommunications infrastructure, Timor-Leste is the second to last
ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index
(NRI), with only Myanmar falling behind it in Southeast Asia. In the 2014 NRI
ranking, Timor-Leste ranked number 141 overall, down from 134 in 2013.

Timor-Leste is part of the Timor Leste–Indonesia–Australia Growth Triangle
(TIA-GT).

### Agriculture

The agriculture sector employs 80% of Timor-Leste's active population. In
2009, about 67,000 households grew coffee in Timor-Leste, with a large
proportion of those households being poor. Currently, the gross margins are
about $120 per hectare, with returns per labour-day of about $3.70. There were
11,000 households growing mung beans as of 2009, most of them by subsistence
farming. 94% of domestic fish catch comes from the ocean, especially coastal
fisheries. 66% of families are in part supported by these subsistence
activities, however the country as a whole does not produce enough food to be
self-sustaining, and thus relies on imports. Coffee, rice, maize, coconuts,
cassava, soybeans, bananas, mango, and sweet potatoes are cultivated here.
With 5,014 Metric Tons in 2019, the country was ranked number 42 among other
countries in Avocados Production.

After petroleum, the second largest export is coffee, which generates about
$10 million a year. 9,000 tonnes of coffee, 108 tonnes of cinnamon, and 161
tonnes of cocoa were harvested in 2012 making the country the 40th ranked
producer of coffee, the 6th ranked producer of cinnamon and the 50th ranked
producer of cocoa worldwide. In 2019, 186 Metric Tons of cocoa beans were
produced and the country was number 48.

### Energy

#### Oil and gas

The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to the Australia-
bound Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop petroleum and natural gas
deposits in the waters southeast of Timor. However, this was curtailed by the
Indonesian invasion in 1976.[_citation needed_] The resources were divided
between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. Timor-Leste
inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained
independence.[_citation needed_] A provisional agreement (the Timor Sea
Treaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent on 20 May 2002) defined a
Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and awarded 90% of revenues from
existing projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to Australia. An
agreement in 2005 between the governments of Timor-Leste and Australia
mandated that both countries put aside their dispute over maritime boundaries
and that Timor-Leste would receive 50% of the revenues from the resource
exploitation in the area (estimated at A$26 billion, or about US$20 billion
over the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. In
2013, Timor-Leste launched a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague to pull out of a gas treaty that it had signed with Australia, accusing
the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) of bugging the East Timorese
cabinet room in Dili in 2004.

At the time of independence Timor-Leste had per capita natural wealth
equivalent to the wealth of an upper-middle income country. Over half of this
was in oil, and over a quarter natural gas. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was
established in 2005 to turn these non-renewable resources into a more
sustainable form of wealth. By 2009 it had a value of US$4.8 billion, and by
2011 it had reached a worth of US$8.7 billion. Timor-Leste is labelled by the
International Monetary Fund as the "most oil-dependent economy in the world".
The Petroleum Fund pays for nearly all of the government's annual budget,
which increased from $70 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2011, with a $1.8
billion proposal for 2012. East-Timor's income from oil and gas stands to
increase significantly after its cancellation of a controversial agreement
with Australia, which gave Australia half of the income from oil and gas from
2006. From 2005 to 2021, $23 billion earned from oil sales has entered the
fund. $8 billion has been generated from investments, while $12 billion has
been spent. A decrease in oil and gas reserves led to decreasing HDI beginning
in 2010. 80% of government spending comes from this fund, which as of 2021 had
$19 billion, 10 times greater than the size of the national budget. As oil
income has decreased, the fund is at risk of being exhausted. Withdrawals have
exceeded sustainable levels almost every year since 2009.

#### Electricity

Electricidade De Timor-Leste (EDTL) is the vertically integrated monopoly
generator and distributor of electric power within the on-grid areas.

### Tourism

In 2017, the country was visited by 75,000 tourists. Since the later 2010s,
tourism has been increasing and the number of hotels and resorts has
increased. The government decided to invest in the expansion of the
international airport in Dili.

One promising long-term project is the joint development with Australia of
petroleum and natural gas resources in the waters southeast of Timor-Leste.

Timor-Leste inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it gained
independence, repudiating the Timor Gap Treaty as illegal. A provisional
agreement (the Timor Sea Treaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent in
2002) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA), and awarded 90% of
revenues from existing projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to
Australia. The first significant new development in the JPDA since East
Timorese independence is the largest petroleum resource in the Timor Sea, the
Greater Sunrise gas field. Its exploitation was the subject of separate
agreements in 2003 and 2005. Only 20% of the field lies within the JPDA and
the rest in waters not subject to the treaty (though claimed by both
countries). The initial, temporary agreement gave 82% of revenues to Australia
and only 18% to Timor-Leste.

The government of Timor-Leste has sought to negotiate a definite boundary with
Australia at the halfway line between the countries, in accordance with the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The government of Australia
preferred to establish the boundary at the end of the wide Australian
continental shelf, as agreed with Indonesia in 1972 and 1991. Normally a
dispute such as this would be referred to the International Court of Justice
or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for an impartial
decision, but the Australian government had withdrawn from these international
jurisdictions (solely on matters relating to maritime boundaries) shortly
before East Timorese independence.

Nevertheless, under public and diplomatic pressure, the Australian government
offered instead a last-minute concession solely on royalties from the Greater
Sunrise gas field. An agreement was signed in 2005 under which both countries
would set aside the dispute over the maritime boundary, and Timor-Leste would
receive 50% of the revenues (estimated at A$26 billion or about US$20 billion
over the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. Other
developments within waters claimed by Timor-Leste but outside the JPDA
(Laminaria-Corallina and Buffalo) continue to be exploited unilaterally by
Australia, however.

Some proceeds from Timor-Leste's petroleum royalties are directed to the
country's sovereign wealth fund, the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund.
