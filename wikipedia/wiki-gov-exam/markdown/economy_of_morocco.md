The **economy of Morocco** is a market economy, governed by the law of supply
and demand. Since 1993, in line with many Western world changes, Morocco has
followed a policy of privatisation. Morocco has become a major player in
African economic affairs, and is the 6th largest African economy by GDP (PPP).
The World Economic Forum placed Morocco as the most competitive economy in
North Africa, in its African Competitiveness Report 2014–2015.

The economic system of the country demonstrated resilience to the climate,
commodity, and pandemic shocks of the early 2020s. As of 2022, Morocco had the
eighth-highest GDP in the Arab world, despite not being a significant oil-
producing country. Since the early-1980s, the Moroccan government has pursued
an economic programme toward accelerating economic growth with the support of
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of
creditors. From 2018, the country's currency, the Moroccan dirham, is fully
convertible for current account transactions; reforms of the financial sector
have been implemented; and state enterprises are being privatised.

The services sector accounts for just over half of the GDP. The industry
sector– consisting of mining, construction and manufacturing – is an
additional quarter. The sectors that recorded the highest growth are the
tourism, telecommunications, and textile sectors. Morocco, however, still
depends to an inordinate degree on agriculture, which accounts for around 14%
of GDP but employs 40–45% of the Moroccan population. With a semi-arid
climate, it is difficult to assure good rainfall and Morocco's GDP varies
depending on the weather. Fiscal prudence has allowed for consolidation, with
both the budget deficit and debt falling as a percentage of GDP. The major
resources of the Moroccan economy are agriculture, phosphate minerals, and
tourism. Sales of fish and seafood are important as well. Industry and mining
contribute about one-third of the annual GDP. Morocco is the world's third-
largest producer of phosphates (after the United States and China), and the
price fluctuations of phosphates on the international market greatly influence
Morocco's economy. Tourism and workers' remittances have played a critical
role since independence. The production of textiles and clothing is part of a
growing manufacturing sector that accounted for approximately 34% of total
exports in 2002, employing 40% of the industrial workforce. The government
wishes to increase 3 exports from $1.27 billion in 2001 to $3.29 billion in
2010 and has raised this to 5.7 billion in 2019.

The high cost of imports, especially of petroleum imports, is a major problem.
Morocco suffers both from structural unemployment and a large external debt.
The youth unemployment rate was 27.2% in 2021. About 80% of jobs are informal
and the income gaps are very high. In 2022, Morocco ranked 120th out of 191
countries in the world on the Human Development Index (HDI), behind Algeria
(93rd) and Tunisia (101st). It is the most unequal country in North Africa
according to the NGO Oxfam.

## Macro-economic trend

Morocco is a fairly stable economy with continuous growth over the past half-
century. Current GDP per capita grew 47% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth
of 274% in the 1970s. However, this proved unsustainable and growth scaled
back sharply to just 8.2% in the 1980s and 8.9% in the 1990s.

In recent years, Morocco's economy has demonstrated resilience amid global
challenges. Real GDP growth rebounded to 3.4% in 2023, driven by a resurgence
in tourism, robust manufacturing exports (notably in the automotive and
aeronautics sectors), and increased private consumption. However, agricultural
output contracted due to drought conditions, which lead to a projected
slowdown in overall growth to 3.2% in 2024. The IMF anticipated growth to
accelerate to approximately 3.9% in 2025, supported by infrastructure projects
and structural reforms.

---|---|---|---|---  
1980 | 74,090 | 3.93 Dirhams | 33 | 8.87   
1985 | 129,507 | 10.06 Dirhams | 53 | 3.72

1995 | 281,702 | 8.54 Dirhams | 91 | 5.03   
  
Inflation significantly declined from a peak of 10.1% in early 2023 to an
average of 1.5% in 2024, primarily due to falling food prices. In response,
the central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib, reduced the key interest rate from 3.0% to
2.75% in June 2024. The IMF projected inflation to stabilize around 2% in the
medium term.

Fiscal consolidation efforts led to a reduction in the budget deficit, which
decreased from 5.2% of GDP in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023. Public debt was projected
to gradually decline from 69.5% of GDP in 2023 to 68.2% by 2025. The current
account deficit narrowed significantly to 0.6% of GDP in 2023, the lowest
level since 2007, bolstered by strong tourism revenues, manufacturing exports,
and remittances. Foreign direct investment also increased, particularly in
sectors like green hydrogen and electric vehicle battery components.

The unemployment rate remained elevated at 13% in 2023, with higher rates
among youth (35.8%), women (18.3%), and recent graduates (19.7%).
Additionally, the poverty rate increased from 3% in 2021 to 4.9% in 2022. In
terms of GDP per capita, Morocco reached $3,672 in 2023, a 6.69% increase from
2022. The IMF estimated GDP per capita (PPP) at $10,615 in 2024.

Over the years, Morocco implemented a series of development plans, enacted
economic reforms, and encountered various challenges that have influenced its
economic trajectory. From the 1960s to the present day, the country has sought
to achieve sustained economic growth, reduce unemployment rates, and improve
the living standards of its population.

### 1960–1989

Morocco instituted a series of development plans to modernize the economy and
increase production during the 1960s. Net investment under the five-year plan
for 1960–64 was about $1.3 billion. The plan called for a growth rate of 6.2%,
but by 1964 the growth rate had only reached 3%. The main emphasis of the plan
was on the development and modernization of the agricultural sector. The five-
year development plan for 1968–72 called for increased agriculture and
irrigation. The development of the tourist industry also figured prominently
in the plan. The objective was to attain an annual 5% growth rate in GDP; the
real growth rate actually exceeded 6%.

Investment during the 1970s included industry and tourism development. The
five-year plan for 1973–77 envisaged a real economic growth of 7.5% annually.
Industries singled out for development included chemicals (especially
phosphoric acid), phosphate production, paper products, and metal fabrication.
In 1975, King Hassan II announced a 50% increase in investment targets to
allow for the effects of inflation. The 1978–80 plan was one of stabilization
and retrenchment, designed to improve Morocco's balance-of-payments position.

The ambitious five-year plan for 1981–85, estimated to cost more than $18
billion, aimed at achieving a growth rate of 6.5% annually. The plan's
principal priority was to create some 900,000 new jobs and to train managers
and workers in modern agricultural and industrial techniques. Other major
goals were to increase production in agriculture and fisheries to make the
country self-sufficient in food, and to develop energy, industry, and tourism
to enable Morocco to lessen its dependence on foreign loans. The plan called
for significant expansion of irrigated land, for increased public works
projects such as hospitals and schools, and for economic decentralization and
regional development through the construction of 25 new industrial parks
outside the crowded Casablanca-Kénitra coastal area. Large industrial projects
included phosphoric acid plants, sugar refineries, mines to exploit cobalt,
coal, silver, lead, and copper deposits, and oil-shale development.

### 1990–2000s

Moroccan GDP growth (1990–2005).

Moroccan economic policies brought macroeconomic stability to the country in
the early 1990s but did not spur growth sufficient to reduce unemployment
despite Moroccan Government's ongoing efforts to diversify the economy.
Drought conditions depressed activity in the key agricultural sector, and
contributed to an economic slowdown in 1999. Favourable rainfalls have led
Morocco to a growth of 6% for 2000. Formidable long-term challenges included:
servicing the external debt; preparing the economy for freer trade with the
EU; and improving education and attracting foreign investment to improve
living standards and job prospects for Morocco's youthful population.

Macroeconomic stability coupled with relatively slow economic growth
characterized the Moroccan economy over the period 2000–2005. The government
introduced a number of important economic reforms in that period. The economy,
however, remained overly dependent on the agricultural sector. Morocco's
primary economic challenge was to accelerate growth in order to reduce high
levels of unemployment. The government continued liberalizing the
telecommunications sector in 2002, as well as the rules for oil and gas
exploration. This process started with the sale of a second GSM license in
1999. The government in 2003 was using revenue from privatizations to finance
increased spending. Although Morocco's economy grew in the early 2000s, it was
not enough to significantly reduce poverty.

Through a foreign exchange rate anchor and well-managed monetary policy,
Morocco held inflation rates to industrial country levels over the past
decade. Inflation in 2000 and 2001 were below 2%. Despite criticism among
exporters that the dirham has become badly overvalued, the current account
deficit remains modest. Foreign exchange reserves were strong, with more than
$7 billion in reserves at the end of 2001. The combination of strong foreign
exchange reserves and active external debt management gave Morocco the
capacity to service its debt. Current external debt stands at about $16.6
billion. Africa:: Morocco — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency
Archived 2 December 2022 at the Wayback Machine

Economic growth, however, has been erratic and relatively slow, partially as a
result of an over-reliance on the agricultural sector. Agriculture production
is extremely susceptible to rainfall levels and ranges from 13% to 20% of GDP.
Given that 36% of Morocco's population depends directly on agriculture
production, droughts have a severe knock-on effect to the economy. Two
successive years of drought led to a 1% incline in real GDP in 1999 and
stagnation in 2000. Better rains during the 2000 to 2001 growing season led to
a 6.5% growth rate in 2001. Growth in 2006 went above 9%, this was achieved by
a booming real estate market.

The government introduced a series of structural reforms in recent years. The
most promising reforms have been in the liberalization of the
telecommunications sector. In 2001, the process continued with the
privatization of 35% of the state operator Maroc Telecom. Morocco announced
plans to sell two fixed licenses in 2002. Morocco also has liberalized rules
for oil and gas exploration and has granted concessions for many public
services in major cities. The tender process in Morocco is becoming
increasingly transparent. Many believe, however, that the process of economic
reform must be accelerated in order to reduce urban unemployment below the
current rates above 20%.

### Recent developments

50 dirhams and Ksour in the background

Morocco's sound economic management in recent years has yielded strong growth
and investment grade status and it is weathering the negative impacts of the
global crisis impressively well. Morocco is now addressing persistent social
problems by reducing absolute poverty rates, investing in human capital
through quality education, expanding access to drinking water, and linking
rural areas to markets through investment in roads.

Morocco faces challenges on human development outcomes despite progress over
the past decade, in particular. Overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity
in access to secondary education remain high and the country continues to
suffer poor outcomes on infant and maternal mortality. It also needs to
diversify its economy, become more competitive, and integrate further into the
global economy if it is to reach higher growth levels.

The government has recognized this challenge and has put in place an ambitious
process of legal, policy, and institutional modernization that has far-
reaching political, economic, and social dimensions. It has designed and is
now implementing a comprehensive set of new sector strategies that respond to
the overall national vision and that target development challenges with clear,
measurable goals and indicators.[_citation needed_]

Tough government reforms and steady yearly growth in the region of 4–5% from
2000 to 2007, including 4.9% year-on-year growth in 2003–2007 the Moroccan
economy is much more robust than just a few years ago. Economic growth is far
more diversified, with new service and industrial poles, like Casablanca and
Tangier, developing. The agriculture sector is being rehabilitated, which in
combination with good rainfalls led to a growth of over 20% in 2009.

#### 2008

In a statement, released in July 2008, the IMF called Morocco "a pillar of
development in the region" and congratulated King Mohammed VI and the Central
Bank on Morocco's continued strong economic progress and effective management
of monetary policy.

Morocco's economy is expected to grow by 6.5% in 2008, according to the
Moroccan finance minister. While the forecast is slightly lower than the
earlier 6.8% projected growth it still remains quite an achievement
considering the circumstances. GDP growth in 2007 was only 2.2% due to a poor
harvest caused by prolonged periods of drought; Morocco experienced
nonagricultural GDP growth of 6.6 percent in 2007. Inflation is expected to
reach 2.9% in 2008 due to the rising costs of energy. In an increasingly
challenging global economic climate, the IMF expects continued nonagricultural
expansion of the Moroccan economy.

The 2008 financial crisis affected the Moroccan economy in only a limited way
according to the Bank Al-Maghrib.

In a report issued in July 2008, the IMF noted that Morocco's financial sector
is sound and resilient to shocks, and that the remarkable fiscal consolidation
efforts of recent years have allowed the Moroccan economy to absorb the impact
of difficult international economic conditions and increasing global prices
for essential commodities such as petroleum and energy. International economic
experts recognize that Morocco's exemplary economic performance is beneficial
not only to Moroccans, but also for the nearly 90 million people who live the
Maghreb.

Morocco is expected to close the year 2008 with a budgetary surplus ranging
between MAD 3 billion and MAD3.5 billion ($348 million to $407 million),
despite a difficult international context marked by a severe economic crisis.
At the end of November 2008, the state's budget registered a surplus of MAD
3.2 billion ($372 million), while at the end of November 2009, the budgetary
surplus is projected at MAD 6.9 billion ($803 million).

The diversification of the Economy includes a multi-disciplinary approach to
the development of non-agricultural sector, including the creation of special
sectorial zones in industry, tourism and services outsourcing. In addition,
reforms to the higher educational system and business law are also planified
in the new program-contract signed in 2009 between the government, the banking
sector and some zone-development companies. The approach also include a better
sustaining of small-business development and prospection of external markets.
The objective is to become an emerging industrial country of the likes of
Vietnam by 2015.

US Ambassador to the EU noted that:

    "Morocco stands out as a model of economic reform for the region and for other developing countries. The kind of economic progress that Morocco has made, and which the rest of the Maghreb has the potential to accomplish, is the best antidote to the new threat of terrorism in the region."

#### 2009

The economy has remained insulated from the worst effects of the world crisis.
Due in part to the rebounding of the agricultural sector, which had suffered
from a 2007 drought, the economy expanded 5.6% in 2008, with 5.7% growth
forecasted for 2009. Morocco's economy is the 61st largest in the world,
according to the IMF, though its per-capita GDP is low compared to similarly
ranked nations. King Mohammed VI has recently launched two national economic
strategies: Plan Maroc Vert and Plan Emergence. The first seeks to create 1.5m
jobs in the agriculture sector, and add around €7.65 billion to GDP through
€10.8 billion of investments by 2020, while the latter will establish new
industrial zones and boost training to increase efficiency. Additionally,
phosphates production, which accounted for more than a third of 2008 exports,
is being restructured for greater value.

Morocco's economy is expected to achieve a 6.6% growth in the first quarter of
2009 up from 4.8% in the past quarter thanks to prospects for an agricultural
campaign above the average of the past five years.

By the end of December 2008, rainfalls exceeded that of an ordinary year by
106%. This surplus has benefited to all agricultural regions and increased the
water stored in dams destined for agriculture to 40.7%. In these conditions
and taking into consideration a cereal campaign nearing 70 million quintals,
the agricultural value added could increase by 22.2% in the first quarter of
2009, thus contributing 2.9% to the national economic growth.

Due to a decrease of activity among Morocco's main commercial partners,
foreign demand of goods destined towards Morocco would moderately slow down in
2009 compared to the 9% rise in 2008. This trend could continue in Q1 of 2009
with a growth rate not exceeding 2% due to a lackluster economic growth
outlook and the slowdown of international trade.

#### 2019

In June 2019, Morocco signed two agreements to obtain a loan worth $237
million from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. The loan was
taken to fund two investment projects.

#### 2020

On the economic front, the shock of COVID-19 has pushed the Moroccan economy
into its first recession since 1995. Economic output contracted by 15.1% in
the second quarter of 2020, primarily as a result of the lockdown but also of
a sharp reduction in exports caused by the pandemic's disruption to global
value chains and the collapse of receipts from tourism. The shock to supply
and demand, triggered by the pandemic, has been compounded by the fall in
agricultural production due to a severe drought. Although activity picked up
in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the government's preliminary
estimates indicate that Morocco's real GDP contracted by 7% in 2020, leading
to an increase in unemployment from 9.2% to 11.9%.

## Economic growth

Morocco is a fairly stable economy with continuous growth over the past half-
a-century. Current GDP per capita grew 47% in the Sixties reaching a peak
growth of 274% in the Seventies. However, this proved unsustainable and growth
scaled back sharply to just 8.2% in the Eighties and 8.9% in the Nineties.

Real GDP growth is expected to average 5.5% in the 2009–13 period, seen the
prospects in the tourism and the non-agricultural industry, as demand growth
in the Eurozone — Morocco's key export market and source of tourists is
projected to be more subdued. Growth will be well below the 8–10% levels that
are widely regarded as necessary to have a major impact on poverty and
unemployment. Economic growth will also be intermittently hindered by the
impact of periodic droughts on the rain-fed agricultural sector, the country's
largest employer.

## Agriculture

Agriculture employs about 40% of Morocco's workforce. On the Atlantic coast,
where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are
grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells. Livestock are raised and
forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials. Part of the maritime
population fishes for its livelihood. Agadir, Essaouira, El Jadida, and
Larache are among the important fishing harbours. In the rainy sections of the
northeast, barley, wheat, and other cereals can be raised without irrigation.

Morocco produced in 2018:

  * 7.3 million tons of wheat (20th largest producer in the world);
  * 3.7 million tonnes of sugar beet, which is used to produce sugar and ethanol;
  * 2.8 million tons of barley (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.8 million tons of potatoes;
  * 1.5 million tons of olives (3rd largest producer in the world, behind Spain and Italy);
  * 1.4 million tons of tomatoes (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.2 million tons of tangerines (4th largest producer in the world, behind China, Spain and Turkey);
  * 1 million tons of oranges (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 954 thousand tons of onions;
  * 742 thousand tons of watermelons;
  * 696 thousand tons of apples;
  * 616 thousand tons of sugarcane;
  * 500 thousand tons of melons;
  * 480 thousand tons of carrots;
  * 451 thousand tons of grapes;
  * 319 thousand tons of bananas;
  * 256 thousand tons of chilli peppers;
  * 128 thousand tons of fig (3rd largest producer in the world, only behind Turkey and Egypt);

In addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products.

### Land

Agricultural terraces in Anti-Atlas mountains

Morocco is endowed with numerous exploitable resources. With approximately
85,000 square kilometres (33,000 sq mi) of arable land (one-seventh of which
can be irrigated) and its generally temperate Mediterranean climate, Morocco's
agricultural potential is matched by few other Arab or African countries. It
is one of the few Arab countries that has the potential to achieve self-
sufficiency in food production. In a normal year, Morocco produces two-thirds
of the grains (chiefly wheat, barley, and corn [maize]) needed for domestic
consumption.

Morocco exports citrus fruits and early vegetables to the European market. Its
wine industry is developed, and the production of commercial crops (cotton,
sugarcane, sugar beets, and sunflowers) is expanding. Newer crops such as tea,
tobacco, and soybeans have passed the experimental stage, the fertile Gharb
plain being favourable for their cultivation. Morocco is actively developing
its irrigation potential that ultimately will irrigate more than 2.5 million
acres (1 million hectares).

Morocco's forestry policy seeks to restore over 600,000 hectares of forest
ecosystems, battle soil erosion, control water flow, and boost forestry and
tourist revenue. This is supported by the European Investment Bank's
development branch, EIB Global. The EIB-financed component will reforest about
55,000 hectares, resulting in 30 200 years of temporary work and over 6,800
permanent jobs.

### Drought

Unreliable rainfall is a chronic problem that produces drought or sudden
floods. In 1995, Morocco's worst drought in thirty years forced Morocco to
import grain and adversely affected the economy. Another drought occurred in
1997, and one in 1999–2000. Reduced incomes due to drought caused GDP to fall
by 7.6% in 1995, by 2.3% in 1997, and by 1.5% in 1999. During the years
between drought, good rains brought bumper crops to market. Good rainfall in
2001 led to a 5% GDP growth rate.

The danger of drought is ever present and still dramatically affects the
Moroccan economy, even though Moroccan decisionmakers have recently[_when?_]
stated that the economy becomes more diversified and disconnected from rain
falls.[_citation needed_] Especially, cereal yields still depend on
considerable variation in annual precipitation. Cereals constitute the
essential of the agricultural value added and their production is very
sensitive to rain falls. More important is that cereal yields determine not
only the aggregate value added in the agricultural sector but also economic
growth in general.[_citation needed_] According to the Moroccan economist,
Brahim MANSOURI (Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth: Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia
Compared, UNECA, 2008), when drought, measured as a dummy variable computed on
the basis of the rate of growth of cereal yield, endangers extremely, the
growth rate of real GDP would fall by 10%.

### Cannabis

Morocco consistently ranks among the world's largest producers and exporters
of cannabis, and its cultivation and sale provide the economic base for much
of northern Morocco. The cannabis is typically processed into hashish. This
activity represents 0.57% of Morocco's GDP. A UN survey in 2003 estimated
cannabis cultivation at about 1,340 km2 (520 sq mi) in Morocco's five northern
provinces. This represented 10% of the total area and 23% of the arable lands
of the surveyed territory and 1% of Morocco's total arable land. On May 26,
2021, the Moroccan Parliament voted to legalise the use of cannabis for
medical, as well as cosmetic and industrial purposes.

Morocco is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and in 1992 Morocco passed
legislation designed to implement it and its new national strategy against
drugs formulated by its National Committee on Narcotics was adopted in 2005.
That same year, the International Narcotics Control Board commended the
Government of Morocco for its efforts to eradicate cannabis plant cultivation
on its territory, which has resulted in the total potential production of
cannabis resin in the Rif region decreasing by 10% over the previous year. At
the same time, the board called upon the international community to support
its efforts where possible.

Since the early 2010s, a growing debate is taking place in Morocco about the
decriminalisation of cannabis. Powerful political parties are among advocates
of decriminalisation, as the Istiqlal Party and the Authenticity and Modernity
Party.

### Fishing

The fishing industry in Morocco is a leading source of revenue, accounting for
56% of agricultural and 16% of total exports. For a long time, the industry
has been an economic pillar for the country. Morocco is considered the largest
fish market in Africa, with an estimated total catch of 1,084,638 MT in 2001.

## Industry

Moroccan GDP by sector. (1980–2007).

The Moroccan industrial sector looks set to continue the strong growth it has
enjoyed in recent years. Industrial activity recorded a 5.5% increase in 2007,
a slight rise over 2006, when the sector grew by 4.7%. Added value in the
sector increased by 5.6% in 2007. Overall the contribution of industrial
activity to GDP fluctuates between about 25% and 35% every year, depending on
the performance of the agriculture sector. The industrial sector accounted for
about 21.1% of employment in 2007 and the sector is a key component of the
government's effort to curb unemployment. The sector also attracts high levels
of FDI and authorities have announced initiatives to improve the investment
climate, with particular attention to off-shoring activities, automotive,
aeronautics, electronics, food processing activities, products from the sea
and textiles. Other important industrial sectors include mining, chemicals,
construction materials and pharmaceuticals. The future of Morocco's industrial
segment looks bright, particularly as new initiatives make it more globally
competitive in a variety of sectors.

### Manufacturing

Tanneries in Marrakech

Manufacturing accounts for about one-sixth of GDP and is steadily growing in
importance in the economy. Two particularly important components of Morocco's
industrial makeup are processing raw materials for export and manufacturing
consumer goods for the domestic market. Many operations date to the colonial
period. Until the early 1980s, government involvement was dominant and the
major focus was on import substitution. Since then the emphasis has shifted to
privatizing state operations and attracting new private investment, including
foreign sources.

Processing phosphate ore into fertilizers and phosphoric acid for export is a
major economic activity. Food processing for export (canning fish, fresh
vegetables, and fruit) as well as for domestic needs (flour milling and sugar
refining) is also important, and the manufacture of textiles and clothes using
domestically produced cotton and wool is a major source of foreign exchange.
Morocco's iron and steel manufacturing industry is small but provides a
significant share of the country's domestic needs.

The manufacturing sector produces light consumer goods, especially foodstuffs,
beverages, textiles, matches, and metal and leather products. Heavy industry
is largely limited to petroleum refining, chemical fertilizers, automobile and
tractor assembly, foundry work, asphalt, and cement. Many of the processed
agricultural products and consumer goods are primarily for local consumption,
but Morocco exports canned fish and fruit, wine, leather goods, and textiles,
as well as such traditional Moroccan handicrafts as carpets and brass, copper,
silver, and wood implements.

Ownership in the manufacturing sector is largely private. The government owns
the phosphate-chemical fertilizer industry and much of the sugar-milling
capacity, through either partnership or joint financing. It is also a major
participant in the car and truck assembly industry and in tire manufacturing.

### Automotives

The automotive sector is already Morocco's leading export sector and has made
Morocco the leading car manufacturer in Africa. Morocco's fast integration
into the global economy was also facilitated by numerous free trade agreements
with the United States and the European Union. These agreements contributed
undoubtedly in a positive way towards the emergence of export activities in
the country. Foreign direct investment has been expanding as companies are
attracted towards the favorable economic situation of the country, government
support through their numerous initiatives, such as tax exemptions for the
first 5 years and VAT exemptions, modern infrastructure, and a skilled
workforce. Moreover, the automotive sector has the strongest job creation;
85.000 new jobs were created in the sector between 2014 and 2018, bringing the
total jobs in the sector to 158’000.

### Textiles

Textiles form a major industry in Morocco. The European Union is Morocco's top
client in regards to textiles and clothing, with France importing 46% of
hosiery, 28.5% of basic textile and 27.6% of ready-to-wear clothing from
Morocco, managing director of the Moroccan Export Development Center
underlined. Recalling that Morocco's textile and clothing exports totaled some
$3.7 billion in 2007, Saad Benabdallah ascribed this performance to the many
assets that Morocco enjoys, namely, geographical proximity, flexibility,
sourcing skills and the multiple opportunities offered by Free Trade
Agreements with the European Union, United States and Turkey.

### Mining

The mining sector is one of the pillars of Morocco's economy. It represented a
turnover of US$2.7 billion in 2005, including MAD 2.17 billion in exports and
20% of energy consumption. It also employs about 39,000 people with an
estimated MAD 571 million in salaries (2005). Morocco produces a number of
minerals and metals, most importantly, phosphates, silver and
lead.[1][_usurped_]

Morocco possesses 75 percent of the world's phosphate reserves. It is the
world's first exporter (28% of the global market) and third producer (20% of
global production). In 2005, Morocco produced 27.254 million tons of
phosphates and 5.895 million tons of phosphate derivatives.[2][_usurped_]

## Services

Services, including government and military expenditures, account for about
one-fourth of Morocco's GDP. Government spending accounts for fully half of
the service economy, despite an ongoing effort on the part of the government
to sell much of its assets to private concerns. Since the mid-1980s tourism
and associated services have been an increasingly significant sector of the
Moroccan economy and by the late 1990s had become Morocco's largest source of
foreign currency.

During that time the Moroccan government committed significant resources – by
way of loans and tax exemptions – to the development of the tourist industry
and associated services. The government also made direct capital investments
in the development of the service sector, but since the early 1990s it has
begun to divest itself of these properties. Several million visitors enter
Morocco yearly, most of them from Europe. Tourists also arrive from Algeria,
the United States, and East Asia, mainly Japan.

### Tourism

Morocco is a major touristic destination. Tourism is thus a major contributor
to both the economic output and the current account balance, as well as a main
job provider. In 2008 8 million tourists have visited Morocco. Tourist
receipts in 2007 totalled US$7,55 billion. Morocco has developed an ambitious
strategy, dubbed "Vision 2010", aimed at attracting 10 million tourists by
2010. This strategy provides for creating 160,000 beds, thus bringing the
national capacity to 230,000 beds. It also aims to create some 600,000 new
jobs.

Marrakech continues to be the market leader, but the case of Fez, showing a
20% increase of visitors in 2004, gives hope that better organisation can
bring results in diversifying the sector as a whole. Like other regions, Fez
has its Centre Regional du Tourisme (CRT), a local tourism body which
coordinates the local industry and the authorities. Fez's plan involves a
substantial restructuring of the old city and an upgrading of hotel capacity.
Improved transport has brought the city into more direct contact with
potential visitors. There are now direct flights from France, where previously
it was necessary to change plane in Casablanca.

The "Plan Azur", is a large-scale project initiated by king Mohammed VI, is
meant to internationalise Morocco. The plan provides for creating six coastal
resorts for holiday-home owners and tourists: five on the Atlantic coast and
one on the Mediterranean. The plan also includes other large-scale development
projects such as upgrading regional airports to attract budget airlines, and
building new train and road links.

Thus, Morocco achieved an 11% rise in tourism in the first five months of 2008
compared with the same period last year, it said, adding that French visitors
topped the list with 927,000 followed by Spaniards (587,000) and Britons
(141,000). Morocco, which is close to Europe, has a mix of culture and the
exotic that makes it popular with Europeans buying holiday homes.

### Information technology

The IT sector generated a turnover of Dh7 billion ($910,000m) in 2007, which
represented an 11% increase compared to 2006. The number of Moroccan internet
subscribers in 2007 amounted to 526,080, representing an increase of 31.6%
compared to the previous year and a 100% increase compared to 2005. The
national penetration for internet subscription remains low, even though it
increased from 0.38% in 2004 to 1.72% in 2007. Yet over 90% of subscribers
have a broadband ADSL connection, which is one of the highest ratios in the
world. The future of the Moroccan IT sector was laid out in Maroc 2006–12. The
plan aims to increase the combined value of the telecoms and IT sector from
Dh24 billion ($3.1 billion) in 2004 to Dh60 billion ($7.8 billion) in 2012.

While the telecoms sector remains the big earner, with Dh33 billion ($4.3
billion), the IT and off shore industries should generate Dh21 billion ($2.7
billion) each by 2012. In addition, the number of employees should increase
from 40,000 to 125,000. The government hopes that adding more local content to
the internet will increase usage. There have also been efforts to add more
computers to schools and universities. E-commerce is likely to take off in the
next few years, especially as the use of credit cards is gaining more ground
in Morocco. Although computer and internet use have made a great leap forward
in the past five years, the IT market still finds itself in infancy and offers
great potential for further development.

### Retail

The retail industry represents 12.8% of Morocco's GDP and 1.2m people – 13% of
the total workforce – are employed in the sector. Organised retail, however,
represents only a fraction of domestic trade, as shoppers rely on the
country's 1151 souks, markets and approximately 700,000 independent groceries
and shops. The rapid emergence of a middle class – around 30% of the
population – combined with a young and increasingly urban population and a
craving for international brands, is rapidly changing the ways Moroccans spend
their money. Still average purchasing power remains low overall, forcing
retailers to cater to a broad section of the population and to keep prices
low. Despite the challenges, the retail sector has strong growth potential.
The franchising segment will continue to grow, and while strong local brands
are emerging, international brand names will continue to account for the
biggest percentage increase in the sector's turnover. Changing consumption
habits, increasing purchasing power and the growing number of tourists should
boost the development of malls and luxury shopping. However, independent
stores and markets should continue to account for most domestic trade in the
foreseeable future.

### Offshoring

In 2009 Morocco was ranked among the top thirty countries in the offshoring
sector. Morocco opened its doors to offshoring in July 2006, as one component
of the development initiative Plan Emergence, and has so far attracted roughly
half of the French-speaking call centres that have gone offshore so far and a
number of the Spanish ones. According to experts, multinational companies are
attracted by Morocco's geographical and cultural proximity to Europe, in
addition to its time zone. In 2007 the country had about 200 call centres,
including 30 of significant size, that employ a total of over 18,000 people.

### Finance

The central bank of Morocco Bank Al-Maghrib

In 2007 the economic environment remained conducive to further growth of
banking activity in Morocco following a very good year for the sector in 2006.
In 2007 macroeconomic growth, excluding the agricultural sector, remained
quite robust, providing the background for dynamic growth in banking credits.
Total assets of the banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion
($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of
18.1%. The structure of the domestic sector has remained steady in the past
two years, with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state
has started to remove itself from the domestic sector by surrendering part of
its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held
controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile,
foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with
foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as
well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing
companies.

The financial system, though robust, has to take on excessive quantities of
low risk-low return government debt at the expense of riskier, but more
productive private sector lending. This crowding–out of private sector
investment reduces the profitability and growth incentives of the financial
sector.

Fitch Ratings affirmed Morocco's long-term local and foreign issuer default
ratings of "BBB−" and "BBB", respectively, with a stable outlook. The credit
rating agency attributed its classification in part to the "relative
resilience of Morocco's economy to the global economic downturn."

### Insurance

The insurance sector in Morocco is witnessing dynamic growth, driven foremost
by developments in life insurance, which has superseded motor insurance in the
past two years as the leading segment of the market with around one-third of
total premiums. Behind life and auto insurance, accident, work-related
accident, fire and transport insurance were the largest contributors. Total
premiums reached Dh17.7 billion ($2.3 billion) in 2007, ranking Morocco as one
of the largest insurance markets in the Arab world behind Saudi Arabia and the
UAE. The insurance penetration rate is 2.87% of GDP, while the insurance
density is $69 per person.

More broadly, the Moroccan insurance sector is already consolidated, with five
large players controlling the market. The sector is set to be opened up to
foreign competition from 2010 onward, and the consolidation of insurance
companies into larger entities should strengthen the local players to better
compete with eventual competition from foreign insurers. There is also the
possibility that new insurance niches such as takaful (Islamic insurance) and
microinsurance products will become part of the Moroccan market in the medium-
term, but they are unlikely to appear in the near future.

### Media and advertising

According to the Moroccan Advertisers Group, Dh3.9 billion ($507 million) was
spent in 2007, a near-fourfold increase on the Dh1.1 billion ($143 million)
spent in 2000. There is still room for growth, as the market remains
underdeveloped by international standards. Advertising expenditure represented
just over 0.6% of GDP in 2007, compared with 1% in Egypt and 1.5% to 2% in EU
countries. Morocco's 10 biggest advertising spenders account for about 35% of
the total, with telecoms, consumer goods and services companies making up a
large percentage of that amount.

Television retained the lion's share of advertising expenditure, with 55% of
above-the-line advertising. In a 2006 poll, GAM found that 94% of its members
used outdoor advertising, although 81% companied about problems, mainly caused
by quality issues and delays. The potential for expansion is huge, and while
telecoms should remain the largest advertising segment, fast-growing sectors
of the economy such as retail, automobile and real estate are providing
advertising companies with new opportunities.

### Communications

The telecoms sector increased in value from Dh25.6 billion ($3.3 billion) in
2006 to Dh33.3 billion ($4.2 billion) in 2007. With a workforce of some 41,000
employees, the sector contributes 7% to annual GDP and is one of the country's
leading recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI). Under the development
plan, the sector should employ 125,000 people by 2012 and contribute 10% of
GDP. With the penetration rates of 69.4% from mobile phones and 8.95% for
fixed lines, the Moroccan telecoms industry is set to continue to grow. The
call centre industry – partially as a result of offshore initiatives, such as
Casanearshore and Rabat Technoplis – will continue to expand. However, the
worldwide call centre industry is highly competitive and education is the key
to success if Morocco truly intends to become a leading international player
in this industry.

### Telephone system

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government undertook a major expansion
and modernization of the telecommunications system. This nearly quadrupled the
number of internal telephone lines and greatly improved international
communications. In 1996 the state-owned telecommunications industry was opened
up to privatization by a new law that allowed private investment in the retail
sector, while the state retained control of fixed assets. In 1998 the
government created Maroc Telecom (Ittiṣālāt al-Maghrib), which provides
telephone, cellular, and Internet service for the country. Satellite dishes
are found on the roofs of houses in even the poorest neighbourhoods,
suggesting that Moroccans at every social and economic level have access to
the global telecommunications network. The Internet has made steady inroads in
Morocco; major institutions have direct access to it, while private
individuals can connect via telecommunications "boutiques", a version of the
cyber cafés found in many Western countries, and through home computers.

Morocco has a good system composed of open-wire lines, cables, and microwave
radio relay links. The internet is available. The principal switching centers
are Casablanca and Rabat. The national network is nearly 100% digital using
fiber-optic links. An improved rural service employs microwave radio relay.
The international system has seven submarine cables, three satellite earth
stations, two Intelsat (over the Atlantic Ocean) and one Arabsat. There is a
microwave radio relay to Gibraltar, Spain and the Western Sahara. Coaxial
cables and microwave radio relays exist to Algeria. Morocco is a participant
in Medarabtel and a fiber-optic cable links from Agadir to Algeria and
Tunisia.

  * Main lines in use: 3.28 million (2012) : estimation
  * Mobile cellular: 47.25 million [135% of the total population] (2015) : estimation
  * Internet users: 21.2 million [60.6% of the total population] (2014): estimation

### Radio

  * AM stations: 25;
  * FM stations: 31;
  * Shortwave: 11 (2007);
  * Radio sets: 7.78 million (2007).

### Broadband Internet access

Operated by Maroc Telecom. The service started as a test in November 2002
before it was launched in October 2003. The service is offered by the
subsidiary Menara. As well as Inwi (also known as Wana Co.) and Meditel that
turned into Orange.

### Equity markets

Privatization has stimulated activity on the Casablanca Stock Exchange (Bourse
de Casablanca) notably through trade in shares of large former state-owned
operation. Founded in 1929, it is one of the oldest stock exchanges in Africa,
but it came into reckoning after financial reforms in 1993, making it the
third largest in Africa. The stock market capitalisation of listed companies
in Morocco was valued at $75,495 billion in 2007 by the World Bank. That is an
increase of 74% compared with the year 2005. Having weathered the global
financial meltdown, the Casablanca Stock Exchange is stepping up to its
central role of financing the Moroccan economy. Over the next few years, it
seeks to double its number of listed companies and more than quadruple its
number of investors.

## Government finances

### Fiscal policies

Morocco has made great progress toward fiscal consolidation in recent years,
under the combined effect of strong revenue performance and efforts to tackle
expenditure rigidities, notably the wage bill. The overall fiscal deficit
shrank by more than 4 percentage points of GDP during the last four years,
bringing the budget close to balance in 2007. However, the overall deficit is
projected to widen to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2008, driven by the upward surge
in the fiscal cost of Morocco's universal subsidy scheme following the sharp
increase in world commodity and oil prices.

Fiscal policy decisions so far have been mostly discretionary, as there is no
explicit goal for fiscal policy. Looking forward, the question of a possible
anchor for medium-term fiscal policy is worth exploring. Morocco's low social
indicators and large infrastructure needs could justify an increase in social
spending and public investment. Further, some nominal tax rates remain high by
international standards, possibly warranting a lowering of some rates. At the
same time, the relatively high level of public debt remains a constraining
factor, particularly as heightened attractiveness to investors is a key
component of Morocco's strategy of deepening its integration in the global
economy.

Morocco has made major progress in recent years to increase economic growth
and strengthen the economy's resilience to shocks. The gains reflect sound
macroeconomic policies and sustained structural reforms, and are reflected in
the gradual improvement in living standards and per capita income.

### Debt management

The turnaround in the fiscal performance is particularly noteworthy. Around
the start of the 21st century, Morocco's overall deficit stood at 5.3 percent
of GDP, and gross total government debt amounted to three-fourths of GDP. In
2007, reflecting a strong improvement in revenue performance and moderate
growth in expenditure, the budget was close to balanced. Under the combined
effect of a prudent fiscal policy and sizeable privatization receipts, the
total debt stock had shrunk by 20 percentage points, and now stands at a
little over half of GDP. As a result, perceptions of Morocco's
creditworthiness have improved.

### Taxation

Tax revenues provide the largest part of the general budget. Taxes are levied
on individuals, corporations, goods and services, and tobacco and petroleum
products.

## External trade

Morocco maintains strong trade relations with the European Union (EU), which
remains its largest trading partner. In 2022, 56% of Morocco's exports were
directed to the EU, while 45% of its imports originated from the EU. The total
trade in goods between Morocco and the EU amounted to €53.3 billion that year.
Key exports to the EU included transport equipment (23.5%), machinery and
appliances (21.2%), and textiles (14.3%). In 2023, Morocco's primary export
destinations were Spain (22.5%), France (20.5%), Italy (5.2%), the United
Kingdom (4.5%), and Germany (4.3%). On the import side, the main suppliers
were Spain (15.7%), China (10.6%), France (10.6%), the United States (8.4%),
and Türkiye (5.1%).

The country's trade deficit narrowed by 7.3% in 2023, reaching 286 billion
dirhams ($28.6 billion). This improvement was attributed to a 2.5% decrease in
imports, totaling 715 billion dirhams, and a slight increase in exports to 429
billion dirhams. Notably, energy imports declined by 20.4% to 122 billion
dirhams, while automotive sector exports surged by over 27% to a record 141
billion dirhams. Tourism revenues also reached new heights, increasing by
11.7% to 104 billion dirhams, supported by a record 14.5 million visitors.
Remittances from Moroccans abroad contributed significantly, rising by 4% to
115 billion dirhams. However, in 2024, the trade deficit increased by 7.3% to
306.47 billion dirhams, driven by a 6.4% rise in imports to 761.45 billion
dirhams and a 5.8% increase in exports to 454.97 billion dirhams. The growth
in exports was mainly propelled by the aerospace sector (14.9%), phosphates
and derivatives (13.1%), the automotive industry (6.3%), and the agriculture
and agri-food sector (3.1%).

The EU-Morocco Association Agreement, signed in 1996 and effective from 2000,
aims to establish a free trade area and strengthen economic ties within the
framework of the Barcelona Process. Morocco has also entered into free trade
agreements with the United States (effective from 2006), the Agadir Agreement
with Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia, and a free trade agreement with Türkiye.
Additionally, Morocco acceded to the Regional Convention on pan-Euro-
Mediterranean preferential rules of origin in 2012, facilitating regional
integration and trade.

## Investment

Moroccans.

Morocco has become an attractive destination for European investors thanks to
its relocation sites "Casashore" and "Rabatshore", and to the very rapid cost
escalation in Eastern Europe. The offshoring sector in Morocco is of great
importance as it creates high-level jobs that are generally accompanied by an
influx of Moroccan immigrants. Noting however that human resources remain the
major concern for companies seeking to gain a foothold in Morocco. In this
regard, it has been deemed an important decision of the Moroccan government to
accelerate training in the required disciplines.

In a bid to promote foreign investments, Morocco in 2007 adopted a series of
measures and legal provisions to simplify procedures and secure appropriate
conditions for projects launching and completing. Foreign trade minister,
Abdellatif Maazouz cited that these measures include financial incentives and
tax exemptions provided for in the investment code and the regional investment
centres established to accompany projects. These measures combined with
actions carried out by the Hassan II Fund for Development increased foreign
investments in Morocco by $544.7 million in 2007. 20% of these investments
came from Islamic countries.

Moroccan officials have heralded a significant increase in the amount of money
Moroccan expatriates are sending home. Government efforts are underway to
encourage Moroccans living abroad to increase their investments at home, and
to allay concerns about bureaucracy and corruption. With money sent home by
Moroccan migrants reaching $5.7 billion in 2007, Morocco came in second,
behind Egypt, on the recent World Bank list of the top 10 MENA remittance
recipient countries. Neighbouring Algeria ($2.9 billion) came in at number
five. According to the World Bank, remittances constituted 6.4% of GDP in
Morocco in 2020 and amounted to more than $7.4 billion. Despite the COVID-19
pandemic, remittances from Moroccans residing abroad continued in an upward
trend.

The European Investment Bank started making investments in Morocco in 1979,
and has since invested €9.6 billion since then, including €2.5 billion since
2017.

### Foreign direct investment

Foreign Direct Investments in Morocco grew to $2.57 billion in 2007 from $2.4
billion a year earlier to position the country in the fourth rank in Africa
among FDI recipients, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development. Although other studies have shown much higher figures.
Expectations for 2008 were promising noting that 72 projects were approved for
a global amount of $9.28 billion. These were due to open 40,023 direct and
stable job opportunities. However, keeping with the global trend, FDI dropped
29% to €2.4 billion in 2008, the first decline since 2004.

While the recovery of pre-crisis levels very much hinges on the health of the
global economy, Morocco has made steps towards becoming a more attractive FDI
destination, according to the World Bank's Doing Business 2010 report, ranking
second in North African neighbours. The majority of FDI continues to derive
from the EU, specifically France. Morocco is also a source of foreign
investments. In 2007, it has injected $652 million in projects abroad, which
put Morocco in the third position in Africa.

### Investment by country

Most of the FDIs injected in Morocco came from the European Union with France,
the major economic partner of the North African kingdom, topping the list with
investments worth $1.86 billion, followed by Spain ($783 million), the report
said. The influx of European countries in Morocco's FDI represents 73.5% of
the global amount received in 2007. 19.3% of the investments came from Arab
countries, whose share in Morocco's FDI showed a marked rise, as they only
represented 9.9% of the entire FDIs in 2006. A number of Arab countries,
mainly from the Persian Gulf region are involved in large-scale projects in
Morocco, including the giant Tanger Med port on the Mediterranean. Morocco
remains the preferred destination of foreign investors in the Maghreb region
(Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia), with a total of $13.6
billion between 2001 and 2007, which puts it largely on the top of the list.

### Investment by sector

In terms of sectors, tourism has the biggest share of investment with $1.55
billion, that is 33% of the total FDIs, followed by the real estate sector and
the industrial sector, with respectively $930 million and $374 million.
Moroccan expatriates' share of the FDI stood at $92 million in 2007, up from
$57 million in 2006, and they touch mainly the sectors of real estate, tourism
and catering, according to the report.

## Science and technology

The national system of scientific and technical research is guided by
different elements, such as the pronouncements of the king, reports of special
commissions, five-year plans, and the creation of a special programme for the
support of research. The Moroccan government's Five-Year Plan for 2000–2004
articulated the priority lines for research. The declared objectives of this
plan were to align S&T research with socio-economic development priorities.
Sectors declared as priority areas were: agriculture, health fisheries,
drinking water, geology, mining, energy, environment, information and
telecommunications technologies, and transport.

This approach highlighted the need for effective institutional coordination,
which enabled different parties to work together around common priority
socioeconomic objectives. The private sector is the least active player in
research activity in Morocco. The REMINEX Corporation (Research on Mines and
Exploitation) is the most prominent research performer in the private sector,
and is a subsidiary of Omnium Nord Africain, the largest privately owned
mining group in Morocco. The most recent figures available on the number of
research staff in Morocco are those provided by the Ministry of National
Education, Higher Education, Professional Training and Scientific Research in
its 2002–2003 annual report. According to this report, Morocco had 17 390
research staff in 2002–2003. The majority (58%) were employed in the
university sector.

Research institutions include the Scientific Institute, founded in 1920 in
Rabat, which does fundamental research in the natural sciences, and the
Scientific Institute of Maritime Fishing, founded in 1947, in Casablanca,
which studies oceanography, marine biology, and topics related to development
of the fishing industry. Nine universities and colleges offer degrees in basic
and applied sciences. In 1987–97, science and engineering students accounted
for 41% of college and university enrollments.

## Economy of Western Sahara

Fishing and phosphate mining are the main activities in Moroccan-administered
Western Sahara. Fruits and vegetables are grown in the few oases, while
nomadic herders keep camels, sheep and goats.

## Development of the Northern Region

Historically, the Casablanca-Rabat axis has been more prosperous and has
received more government attention than the predominantly mountainous northern
provinces and the Western Sahara region. Although the latter region has
received government attention since the 1990s because of its phosphate
deposits, the northern provinces, which include the Rif Mountains, home to 6
million Moroccans, had been largely neglected. The uneven development among
Morocco's regions fueled a cycle of rural-urban migration that has shown no
signs of slowing down.

In 1998, the government launched a program to develop the northern region,
largely with international help. Spain had shown particular interest in the
development of the region, because its underdevelopment has fueled illegal
immigration and drug trafficking across the Strait of Gibraltar.

When king Hassan II passed on, his son, Mohammed VI, made it his duty to
develop the Northern Region, and especially its biggest city, Tangier.

The state-owned railway company will engage some $755 million in investment in
the northern region, including building a railway line between Tangier and
Tangier-Med port (43 km), improving the Tangier-Casablanca railway line and
modernizing many train stations over the next few years.

### Tangier

Before 1956, Tangier was a city with international status. It had a great
image and attracted many artists. After Morocco regained control over Tangier,
this attention slacked off. Investment was low and the city lost its economic
importance. But when Mohammed VI became king in 1999, he developed a plan for
the economic revival of Tangier. New developments include a new airport
terminal, a soccer stadium with seating for 45,000 spectators, a high-speed
train line and a new highway to connect the city with Casablanca.
Additionally, a new train station was constructed, called Tanger-Ville.

The creation of a free economic zone increased the economic output of the city
significantly. It allowed Tangier to become an industrial pillar of the
country. But the biggest investment was the creation of the new port Tanger-
Med. It is the largest port in Africa and on the Mediterranean. The city is
undergoing an economic boom. This increased the need for a commercial
district, Tangier City Center, which was inaugurated in 2016. In 2012, the
Renault Tanger Méditerranée automobile plant was opened, with an annual
production over 250,000 units.

## Infrastructure

According to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2019, Morocco Ranked 16th in
the world in terms of Roads, 16th in Sea, 45th in Air and 64th in Railways.
This gives Morocco the best infrastructure rankings in the African continent.

Modern infrastructure development, such as ports, airports, and rail links, is
a top government priority. To meet the growing domestic demand, the Moroccan
government invested more than $15 billion from 2010 to 2015 in upgrading its
basic infrastructure.

Morocco has one of the best road systems on the continent. Over the past 20
years, the government has built approximately 1770 kilometers of modern roads,
connecting most major cities via toll expressways. The Moroccan Ministry of
Equipment, Transport, Logistics, and Water aims to build an additional 3380
kilometers of expressway and 2100 kilometers of highway by 2030, at an
expected cost of $9.6 billion. While focusing on linking the southern
provinces notably the cities of Laayoune and Dakhla to the rest of Morocco.

In 2014, Morocco began the construction of the second high-speed railway
system in Africa linking the cities of Tangiers and Casablanca. It was
inaugurated in 2018 by the King following over a decade of planning and
construction by Moroccan national railway company ONCF. It is the first phase
of what is planned to eventually be a 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) high-speed
rail network in Morocco. an extension of the line to Marrakesh is already
being planned.

Morocco also has the largest port in Africa and the Mediterranean called
Tanger-Med, which is ranked the 18th in the world with a handling capacity of
over 9 million containers. It is situated in the Tangiers free economic zone
and serves as a logistics hub for Africa and the world.

## Economic inequality

The growth pace that the Moroccan economy witnessed since the beginning of the
1998–2007 decade has generated significant progress in terms of national
income, employment and living standards. However, the results obtained show
considerable disparities in terms of the distribution of the fruit of this
growth, whether between the production factors, the socio-economic groups or
the urban and rural areas. In fact, the national income grew at an average
annual rate of 5.5% during the 1998–2007 decade. This improvement in the
national income however seems to be insufficient to face up to the
discrepancies in terms of living standards and the scale of deficits at the
social level.

The real income of the population registered, during the last 10 years, an
annual increase of 2.5%, taking into consideration the fluctuations relating
the climatic conditions, which mainly affect the most vulnerable populations
and their living standards. The national survey on Moroccans' living standards
shows that the part of the most well off (10% of the population) in the
overall consumption expenses in 2001 reached 12 times that of the most
disadvantaged population (10%). Despite the fact that these disparities tend
to decrease in urban areas, these data show the importance of the efforts
needed to overcome this situation.

## Labour

Roughly one-third of the population is employed in agriculture, another one-
third make their living in mining, manufacturing, and construction, and the
remainder are occupied in the trade, finance, and service sectors. Not
included in these estimates is a large informal economy of street vendors,
domestic workers, and other underemployed and poorly paid individuals. High
unemployment is a problem; the official figure is roughly one-tenth of the
workforce, but unofficial estimates are much higher, and—in a pattern typical
of most Middle Eastern and North African countries—unemployment among
university graduates holding nontechnical degrees is especially high. Several
trade unions exist in the country; the largest of these, with nearly 700,000
members, is L'Union Marocaine du Travail, which is affiliated with the
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.

### Unemployment

Morocco's unemployment rate, long a cause for concern, has been dropping
steadily in 2008, on the back of job growth in services and construction.
Further institutional reforms to bolster competitiveness and financial
openness are expected to help the trend to continue.

On the whole, the growth rate of the economy will not reduce the unemployment
rate significantly, also taking account of the constant rise in the number of
first entrants on the labour market. The growth level of the last five years
did, however, reduce urban unemployment from 22% in 1999 to 18.3% in 2005, and
the national rate from 13.9% in 1999 to 10.8% in 2005. The State High Planning
Commission that Morocco's official unemployment rate dropped to 9.1% in Q2
2008, down from 9.6% in Q1. This leaves Morocco with some 1.03m unemployed,
compared to 1.06m at the end of March. Unemployment stood at 9.8% at the end
of 2007, up 0.1% from the end of 2006.

Urban areas saw particularly strong job growth, and the services and
construction sectors were the two leading drivers of job creation. Services
generated some 152,000 new jobs, with the business process outsourcing (BPO)
and telecoms sector proving particularly dynamic. Meanwhile, government
infrastructure projects, as well as heavy private investment in real estate
and tourism helped boost the construction sector, which created 80,000 new
jobs in the second quarter of 2008.

Evidently, this trend of falling unemployment rates is a positive one.
Joblessness has long been a cause for serious concern in North Africa. Morocco
has a lower rate than its Maghreb neighbours—Tunisia has a rate of around
13.9%, and in Algeria it is around 12.3%—but the issue is still a pressing
one, both for economic and for social reasons. A 2006 government report
suggested that the country needed a net increase of 400,000 jobs annually for
the next two decades in order to provide enough employment for its people,
given the underlying demographic dynamic.

Moreover, with Spanish construction firms facing much harder times, Morocco
may soon face the additional challenge of workers returning from across the
Gibraltar Straits, potentially putting further pressure on the authorities to
create jobs.

With 30.5% of Morocco's population of 34.3m aged 14 or younger, according to
the CIA, job creation for youths is one of the government's major priorities.
2007 data indicate that 17.6% of those in the 15–24 age group are unemployed.
This rises to around one third in urban areas—rural communities often employ
the young in agriculture, including on the family farm, as soon as they leave
school, contributing to relatively high youth employment rates (lower levels
of official unemployment registration are also a factor).

### Child labour

A 2010 report estimates about 150,000 children aged between 5 and 14 were
working in Morocco. Agriculture and domestic services are the predominant
employers. Young girls, locally called as _petites bonnes_ (little maids), are
sent to work as live in domestic servants, many aged 10 or less. These
_petites bonnes_ come from very poor families, face conditions of involuntary
servitude, including long hours without breaks, absence of holidays, physical,
verbal and sexual abuse, withheld wages and even restrictions on their
movement. They are denied education.

More visible forms of child labour includes street children in Casablanca,
Marrakech, Fès and Mèknes. These children survive by selling cigarettes,
begging, shining shoes, washing cars and working as porters and packers in
ports.

The Ministry of Planning in Morocco estimates that there are between 60,000
and 100,000 _petites bonnes_ in the country. Studies commissioned by the
Morocco government finds poverty and lack of school, often in combination, are
primary causes of the little maids phenomenon in Morocco. Additionally, rural
parents do not believe that an education or a diploma of any sort can help
their girls find a job.

## Energy

Morocco has very few reserves of its own and has been affected by the high oil
prices of 2007 and early 2008. The country has to import 96% of its energy
requirements and the national oil bill for the first quarter of 2008 was $1.1
billion—69% higher than for the same period in 2007. According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA) report 2014, Morocco is highly dependent on
imported energy with over 91% of energy supplied coming from abroad. Morocco
is working to diversify its energy sources, especially to develop renewable
energy, with a particular focus on wind energy. Solar power and nuclear energy
are also part of the strategy, but development of the former has been slow and
there has been minimal progress on the latter, aside from an announcement of
collaboration with France in 2007.

In November 2009 Morocco announced a solar energy project worth $9 billion
which officials said will account for 38 percent of the North African
country's installed power generation by 2020. Funding would be from a mix of
private and state capital. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and the Moroccan king. The project will involve five
solar power generation sites across Morocco and will produce 2,000 megawatts
of electricity by 2020. Germany has expressed its willingness to participate
in the development of Morocco's solar energy project which the country has
decided to carry out, as did the World Bank. Germany will also take part in
the development of a water-desalination plant.

The government plans to reorganise its subsidy system, which is a heavy burden
on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease
the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, and sooner or later the
load will have to be shared out. In the short term, national consumption per
capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil
equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of
development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is
a matter of particular importance.

According to a 2006 estimate by the Oil and Gas Journal (OGJ), Morocco has
proven oil reserves of 1,070,000 barrels (170,000 m3) and natural gas reserves
of 60 billion cubic feet (1.7×109 m3). Morocco may have additional hydrocarbon
reserves, as many of the country's sedimentary basins have not yet been
explored. The Moroccan Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (ONHYM) has become
optimistic about finding additional reserves—particularly offshore—following
discoveries in neighboring Mauritania.

Recent activity in Western Sahara, which is believed to contain viable
hydrocarbon reserves, has been controversial. In 2001, Morocco granted
exploration contracts to TotalEnergies and Kerr-McGee, angering Premier Oil
and Sterling Energy, which previously had obtained licenses from the Polisario
government. In 2005, the government-in-exile of the Western Sahara invited
foreign companies to bid on 12 contracts for offshore exploration, with hopes
of awarding production sharing contracts by the end of 2005.[_citation

## Environment

The shift to an environment-conscious approach in Morocco has brought about
scores of investment opportunities, most being in the utility and renewable
energy industries. In addition to the rise in sales of photovoltaic panels,
the business of wind turbines is also surging despite soaring prices on
international markets because of the growing demand. To work towards a
programme of sustainable development, a number of technological updates need
to be made, including improvements to automobiles, the quality of energy
products and increasing the number of renewable energy-producing plants. The
government also needs to promote water conservation and efficiency in order to
prevent further scarcity. Despite these challenges, Morocco is working to
conserve and protect its environment and its efforts were recognised when its
Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment won the environmental prize National
Energy Globe Award in Brussels in 2007.

While Morocco is already a model of water management in the MENA region,
upgrades to its water system under the National Wastewater Management
Programme should further improve wastewater treatment and maximise efficient
water usage. Authorities are promoting better water rationalisation in
agriculture, which uses 80% of water resources, by replacing existing
irrigation systems with micro- irrigation and drip networks. A net energy
importer, Morocco launched the National Renewable Energy and Efficiency Plan
in February 2008 to develop alternative energy to meet 15% of its domestic
needs and increase the use of energy-saving methods. It is expected to create
more than 40,000 jobs and stimulate over €4.5 billion in investment by 2020.
The National Plan for the Development of Solar Thermal Energy, formulated in
2001, aims to install 440,000 solar-powered water heaters by 2012, of which
235,000 are completed.

In May 2009, the World Bank approved a €121m loan to help finance the
implementation of Morocco's solid-waste management programme, which targets a
90% waste disposal rate for urban areas by 2021. The government is taking
measures to mitigate the harmful effects of tourism on Morocco's natural
resources, while increasing incentives for a growing niche of ecotourism
projects. As of January 2008, hotels with good environmental practices will
receive a Green Key label as part of a programme by the Mohammed VI Foundation
for the Protection of the Environment. Under a ten-year plan for the
protection of natural resources, 40,000 to 50,000 ha of forests are replanted
annually with indigenous palm trees.
