Bank of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

The **economy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines** is heavily dependent on
agriculture, being the world's leading producer of arrowroot and grows other
exotic fruit, vegetables and root crops. Bananas alone account for upwards of
60% of the work force and 50% of merchandise exports in Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines. Such reliance on a single crop makes the economy vulnerable to
external factors. St. Vincent's banana growers benefited from preferential
access to the European market. In view of the European Union's announced
phase-out of this preferred access, economic diversification is a priority.

Tourism has grown to become a very important part of the economy. In 1993,
tourism supplanted banana exports as the chief source of foreign exchange. The
Grenadines have become a favourite of the up-market yachting crowd. The trend
toward increasing tourism revenues will likely continue. In 1996, new cruise
ship and ferry berths came on-line, sharply increasing the number of passenger
arrivals. In 1998, total visitor arrivals stood at 202,109 with United States
visitors constituting 2.7%, as most of the nation's tourists are from other
countries in the Caribbean and the United Kingdom. Figures from 2005 record
tourism's contribution to the economy at US$90 million.

St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin
Initiative. The country belongs to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which
has signed a framework agreement with the United States to promote trade and
investment in the region.
