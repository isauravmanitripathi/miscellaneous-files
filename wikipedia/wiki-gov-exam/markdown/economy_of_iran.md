Iran has a mixed, centrally planned economy with a large public sector.[_needs
update_] It consists of hydrocarbon, agricultural and service sectors, in
addition to manufacturing and financial services, with over 40 industries
traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange. With 10% of the world's proven oil
reserves and 15% of its gas reserves, Iran is considered an "energy
superpower". Nevertheless, since 2024 Iran is suffering from an energy crisis.

A unique feature of Iran's economy is the reliance on large religious
foundations called bonyads, whose combined budgets represent more than 30
percent of central government spending.

In 2007, the Iranian subsidy reform plan introduced price controls and
subsidies particularly on food and energy. Contraband, administrative
controls, widespread corruption, and other restrictive factors undermine
private sector-led growth. The government's 20-year vision involved market-
based reforms reflected in a five-year development plan, 2016 to 2021,
focusing on "a resilient economy" and "progress in science and technology".
Most of Iran's exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of
government revenue in 2010. In March 2022, the Iranian parliament under the
then new president Ebrahim Raisi decided to eliminate a major subsidy for
importing food, medicines and animal feed, valued at $15 billion in 2021. Also
in March 2022, 20 billion tons of basic goods exports from Russia including
vegetable oil, wheat, barley and corn were agreed.

Iran's educated population, high human development, constrained economy and
insufficient foreign and domestic investment prompted an increasing number of
Iranians to seek overseas employment, resulting in a significant "brain
drain". However, in 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear
program which removed most international sanctions. Consequently, for a short
period, the tourism industry significantly improved and the inflation of the
country was decreased,[_citation needed_] though US withdrawal from the JCPOA
in 2018 hindered the growth of the economy again and increased
inflation.[_citation needed_]

GDP contracted in 2018 and 2019, but a modest rebound was expected in 2020.
Challenges include a COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, US sanctions
reimposed in mid-2018, increased unemployment due to the sanctions, inflation,
food inflation, a "chronically weak and undercapitalized" banking system, and
an "anemic" private sector, and corruption.Fact Check: Are Ali Khamenei's

## History

Persian Achaemenid gold coin, circa 490 BC

In 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was defeated and captured by the Persians, who
then adopted gold as the main metal for their coins. There are accounts in the
biblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far
out as India and the Kingdom of Kush during the reign of Xerxes the Great
(485–465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the
Persian Empire ran some 2,857 km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250 km
east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern İzmir in Turkey) on the
Aegean Sea.

Modern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1850s when Amir Kabir undertook a
number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes
included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with
other countries. Polyakov's _Bank Esteqrazi_ was bought in 1898 by the Tsarist
government of Russia, and later passed into the hands of the Iranian
government by a contract in 1920. The bank continued its activities under the
name of _Bank Iran_ until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded Keshavarzi
Bank.

The Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1885, with offices in all major
cities of Persia. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–41) improved the country's
overall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against
foreign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern
industries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change,
economic development, and relative political stability.

Reza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, Mohammad
Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941–79). No fundamental change occurred in the economy
of Iran during World War II and the years immediately following. Between 1954
and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to
greater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government
sector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency,
the rial, depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic
policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of
nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.

Prior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the
1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and
modernization. The pace slowed by 1978 as capital flight reached $30 to $40
billion 1980-US dollars just before the revolution.

Following the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the Iran–Iraq War,
over 80% of the economy came under government control. The eight-year war with
Iraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000. The
cost of the war to Iran's economy was some $500 billion.

After hostilities ceased in 1988, the government tried to develop the
country's communication, transportation, manufacturing, health care, education
and energy sectors, including its prospective nuclear power facilities, and
began integrating its communication and transportation systems with those of
neighboring states.

The government's long-term objectives since the revolution were stated as
economic independence, full employment, and a comfortable standard of living
but Iran's population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and its median
age declined. Although many Iranians are farmers, agricultural production has
consistently fallen since the 1960s. By the late 1990s, Iran imported much of
its food. At that time, economic hardship in the countryside resulted in many
people moving to cities.

## Macroeconomic trends

Iran's national science budget in 2005 was about $900 million, roughly
equivalent to the 1990 figure. By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of
its GDP to research and development, ranking the country behind the world
average of 1.4%. In 2009 the ratio of research to GDP was 0.87% against the
government's medium-term target of 2.5%. Iran ranked first in scientific
growth in the world in 2011 and 17th in science production in 2012.[_citation
needed_]

Iran has a broad and diversified industrial base. According to _The Economist_
, Iran ranked 39th in a list of industrialized nations, producing $23 billion
of industrial products in 2008. Between 2008 and 2009 Iran moved to 28th from
69th place in annual industrial production growth because of its relative
isolation from the 2008 financial crisis.

In the early 21st century, the service sector was Iran's largest, followed by
industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture. In 2008, Iran's GDP was
estimated at $382.3 billion ($842 billion PPP), or $5,470 per capita ($12,800
PPP).

In 2010, the nominal GDP was projected to double in the next five years. Real
GDP growth was expected to average 2.2% a year in 2012–16, insufficient to
reduce the unemployment rate. Furthermore, international sanctions have
damaged the economy by reducing oil exports by half, before recovering in
2016. The Iranian rial lost more than half of its value in 2012, directing
Iran to import substitution industrialization and a resistive economy.
According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran is a "transition economy",
i.e., changing from a planned to a market economy.

In 2008, the United Nations classified Iran's economy as semi-developed. In
2014, Iran ranked 83rd in the World Economic Forum's analysis of the global
competitiveness of 144 countries. Political, policy and currency stability are
regarded as the most problematic factors in doing business in Iran. Difficulty
in accessing financing is also a major concern, especially for small and
medium enterprises. Most of Iran's financial resources are directed at
trading, smuggling and speculation instead of production and
manufacturing.[_citation needed_]

In 2008, according to Goldman Sachs, Iran has the potential to become one of
the world's largest economies in the 21st century. In 2014, Iranian President
Hassan Rouhani stated that Iran has the potential to become one of the ten
largest economies within the next 30 years.

One major problem often cited by Iranian industrialists is that the government
is not supporting them by authorizing imports of similar parts or products
into the country, undermining their activity and domestic market. This is
partly due to corrupt interests inside the government and
mismanagement.[_citation needed_]

### Reform plan

Expansion of public healthcare and international relations are the other main
objectives of the fifth plan, an ambitious series of measures that include
subsidy reform, banking recapitalization, currency, taxation, customs,
construction, employment, nationwide goods and services distribution, social
justice and productivity. The intent is to make the country self-sufficient by
2015 and replace the payment of $100 billion in subsidies annually with
targeted social assistance. These reforms target Iran's major sources of
inefficiency and price distortion and are likely to lead to major
restructuring of almost all economic sectors.

By removing energy subsidies, Iran intends to make its industries more
efficient and competitive. By 2016, one third of Iran's economic growth is
expected to originate from productivity improvement. Energy subsidies left the
economy as one of the world's least energy-efficient, with energy intensity
three times the global average and 2.5 times higher than the Middle Eastern
average. Notwithstanding its own issues, the banking sector is seen as a
potential hedge against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected
to directly impact banks.

## National planning

Iran's budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of
Iran and proposed by the government to the parliament before the year's end.
Following approval of the budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a
detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for
approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into
the five-year economic development plan. The plan is part of "Vision 2025", a
strategy for long-term sustainable growth.

Sixth development plan (2016–2021)

The sixth five-year development plan for the 2016–2021 period places emphasis
on "guidelines" rather than "hard targets". It defines only three priorities:

  * the development of a resilient economy;
  * progress in science and technology;
  * and the promotion of cultural excellence.

## Fiscal and monetary policy

Since the 1979 revolution, government spending has averaged 59% on social
policies, 17% on economic matters, 15% on national defense, and 13% on general
affairs. Payments averaged 39% on education, health and social security, 20%
on other social programs, 3% on agriculture, 16% on water, power and gas, 5%
on manufacturing and mining, 12% on roads and transportation and 5% on other
economic affairs. Iran's investment reached 27.7% of GDP in 2009. Between 2002
and 2006, inflation fluctuated around 14%.

In 2008, around 55% of government revenue came from oil and natural gas
revenue, with 31% from taxes and fees. There are virtually millions of people
who do not pay taxes in Iran and hence operate outside the formal economy. The
budget for year 2012 was $462 billion, 9% less than 2011. The budget is based
on an oil price of $85 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at
IRR 12,260 for the same period.

According to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of
budgeting were observed the government could save at least 30 to 35% on its
expenses. The central bank's interest rate is 21%, and the inflation rate has
climbed to 22% in 2012, 10% higher than in 2011. There is little alignment
between fiscal and monetary policy. According to the Central Bank of Iran, the
gap between the rich and the poor narrowed because of monthly subsidies but
the trend could reverse if high inflation persists.

Iran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011 and balances
its external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel. As of
2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of
current sanctions. Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran's
government non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of
the latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a
consequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December
2011 and April 2012.

Iran's external and fiscal accounts reflect falling oil prices in FY 2012, but
remain in surplus. The current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1%
of GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran's
National Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP. In 2013 the
external debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012. Overall
fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7%
in 2015.

Money in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017
pre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian
rial and rise in inflation.

### Defense related burden

According to official data, as of 2023 Iran spends 10.3 billion USD or 2.1% of
its GDP on national defense. This percentage is similar to that in other
countries such as UK, France and Finland.

Iran Ministry of Defense New Weapons Ceremony and Young Soldier Festival

In 2025, the Iranian budget bill granted 51% of the total oil and gas export
revenues, estimated at 12 billion euros, to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Command (LEF).

Iran also finances Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi militia, and Hamas.
The average annual budget reserved for the funding of Iran's proxies is
estimated at US$1.6 billion. According to Syrian opposition sources, starting
from the beginning of 2011, Iran allocated a total of US$50 billion to
maintain the Assad regime in Syria. However, this investment proved to be a
failure following the eventual collapse of the regime.

The most costly of Iran's defense expenditures is its nuclear program. The
estimated total cost of Iran's nuclear program until 2025 approaches US$500
billion. As a result of its nuclear program Iran is subject to international
sanctions, causing a long-term economic stagnation which cost Iran an
additional US$1.2 trillion over 12 years. Furthermore, the sanctions led to a
significant decline in foreign direct investments (FDI), with Iran
experiencing a reduction of approximately 80% in FDI between 2011 and 2021.

## Work time

In 2024, Iran passed a law to make a two-day weekend. Saturday was added to
Friday weekends and Thursdays were removed. The work week was reduced from 44
hours to 40/42 hours.

## Challenges

The GDP of Iran contracted in FY 2018 and FY 2019 and modest rebound is
expected in 2020/2021 according to an April 2020 World Economic Outlook by the
IMF. Challenges to the economy include the COVID-19 outbreak starting in
February 2020, which on top of US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018 and other
factors, led a fall in oil production and are projected to lead to a slow
recovery in oil exports. Labor-force participation has risen but unemployment
is above 10% as of 2020 and projected to rise in 2021 and 2022.

Inflation reached 41.1% in 2019, and is expected to continue "in the coming
years" according to the World Bank, but decline into the 34-33% range. In July
2022, the average inflation rate rose 40.5% while the inflation rate for food
and beverages alone rose 87%. Iran's banking system is "chronically weak and
undercapitalised" according to Nordea Bank Abp, holding billions of dollars of
non-performing loans, and the private sector remains "anemic".

The unofficial Iranian rial to US dollar exchange rate, which had plateaued at
40,000 to one in 2017, has fallen 120,000 to one as of November 2019. Iran's
economy has a relatively low rating in the Heritage Foundation's "Index of
Economic Freedom" (164 out of 180); and ease of doing business ranking (127
among 190) according to the World Bank. Critics have complained that
privatization has led not to state owned businesses being taken over by
"skilled businesspeople" but by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
"and its associates".

In 2020, an Iranian businessperson complained to a foreign journalist (Dexter
Filkins) that the uncertainty of "chronic shortages of material and unruly
inspectors pushing for bribes" made operating his business very difficult --
"Plan for the next quarter? I can't plan for tomorrow morning."

In 2021, according to the NIOC, daily consumption of gasoline in Iran has
surpassed 85 million liters, i.e., 10 times more than Turkey with almost the
same population.

## Ownership

Following the hostilities with Iraq, the Government declared its intention to
privatize most industries and to liberalize and decentralize the economy. Sale
of state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a
nationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006, most industries, some 70% of
the economy, remained state-owned. The majority of heavy industries including
steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the
public sector, with most light industry privately owned.

Article 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country's economy
should consist of state, cooperative, and private based sectors. The state
sector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals,
banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation
networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services,
aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned
and administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned
with production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of
the cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law. As of
2012, 5,923 consumer cooperatives, employed 128,396. Consumer cooperatives
have over six million members. Private sector operate in construction,
agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement
the economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors.

Since Article 44 has never been strictly enforced, the private sector has
played a much larger role than that outlined in the constitution. In recent
years, the role of this sector has increased. A 2004 constitutional amendment
allows 80% of state assets to be privatized. Forty percent of such sales are
to be conducted through the "Justice Shares" scheme and the rest through the
Tehran Stock Exchange. The government would retain the remaining 20%.

In 2005, government assets were estimated at $120 billion. Some $63 billion of
such assets were privatized from 2005 to 2010, reducing the government's
direct share of GDP from 80% to 40%.[_citation needed_] Many companies in Iran
remain uncompetitive because of mismanagement over the years, thus making
privatization less attractive for potential investors. According to then-
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 60% of Iran's wealth is controlled by just 300
people.

### Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps

The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are thought to control about one
third of Iran's economy through subsidiaries and trusts. 2007 estimates by the
_Los Angeles Times_ suggest the IRGC has ties to over one hundred companies
and annual revenue in excess of $12 billion, particularly in construction. The
Ministry of Petroleum awarded the IRGC billions of dollars in no-bid contracts
as well as major infrastructure projects.

Tasked with border control, the IRGC maintains a monopoly on smuggling,
costing Iranian companies billions of dollars each year. Smuggling is
encouraged in part by the generous subsidization of domestic goods, including
fuel. The IRGC also runs the telecommunication company, laser eye-surgery
clinics, makes cars, builds bridges and roads and develops oil and gas fields.

### Religious foundations

Welfare programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 public agencies
alongside semi-state organizations known as _bonyads_ , together with several
private non-governmental organizations. _Bonyads_ are a consortium of over 120
tax-exempt organizations that receive subsidies and religious donations. They
answer directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran and control over 20% of GDP.
Operating everything from vast soybean and cotton farms to hotels, soft drink,
automobile manufacturing, and shipping lines, they are seen as overstaffed,
corrupt and generally unprofitable.

_Bonyad_ companies compete with Iran's unprotected private sector, whose firms
complain of the difficulty of competing with the subsidized _bonyads_.
_Bonyads_ are not subject to audit or Iran's accounting laws. _Setad_ is a
multi-sector business organization, with holdings of 37 companies, and an
estimated value of $95 billion. It is under the control of the Supreme Leader,
Ali Khamenei, and created from thousands of properties confiscated from
Iranians.

After the revolution, the government established a national education system
that improved adult literacy rates. In 2008, 85% of the adult population was
literate, well ahead of the regional average of 62%. The Human Development
Index was 0.749 in 2013, placing Iran in the "high human development" bracket.

In 2008, annual economic growth of above 5% was necessary to absorb the
750,000 new labor force entrants each year. In 2020, agriculture was 10% of
GDP and employed 16% of the labor force. In 2017, the industrial sector, which
includes mining, manufacturing, and construction, was 35% of GDP and employed
35% of the labor force. In 2009, mineral products, notably petroleum,
accounted for 80% of Iran's export revenues, even though mining employs less
than 1% of the labor force.

In 2004, the service sector ranked as the largest contributor to GDP, at 48%
of the economy, and employed 44% of workers. Women made up 33% of the labor
force in 2005. Youth unemployment, aged 15–24, was 29.1% in 2012, resulting in
significant brain drain. In 2016, according to the government, some 40% of the
workforce in the public sector are either in excess or incompetent.

### Labor force and the public sector

The Islamic Republic of Iran employs around 8 million individuals, of whom
roughly 3 million hold formal positions within the three branches of
government, the armed forces, and leadership institutions. These roles
encompass bureaucratic staff, civil servants, and uniformed military
personnel.

Beyond the formal government structure, approximately 2.3 million individuals
are employed in quasi-governmental organizations, including state-owned
enterprises, national banks, municipalities, and the Islamic Azad University.
Additionally, about 2.5 million pensioners receive state stipends, often
distributed through the Relief Committee, a government-controlled charitable
organization. As a result, nearly one in ten Iranian citizens maintain a
regular financial connection to the state.

### Personal income and poverty

Unemployment rate, per-capita income growth and minimum wage, 2000–2009 GNI
per capita:  

Iran in 2010: $4,520 nominal. 2012: $13,000 PPP.

Higher GNI per capita compared to Iran

Lower GNI per capita compared to Iran

Iran is classed as a middle income country and has made significant progress
in provision of health and education services in the period covered by the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2010, Iran's average monthly income
was about $500. The GNI per capita in 2012 was $13,000, by PPP. A minimum
national wage applies to each sector of activity as defined by the Supreme
Labor Council. In 2009 this was about $263 per month ($3,156 per year).

In 2001, approximately 20% of household consumption was spent on food, 32% on
fuel, 12% on health care and 8% on education. In 2015, Iranians had little
personal debt. In 2007, seventy percent of Iranians owned their homes.

In 2018–2019, the median household income of Iran was 434,905,000 rials (a bit
above $3,300), an 18.6% rise from 2017 to 2018, when median household income
was about 366,700,000 rials.[_citation needed_] Adjusted for purchasing power
parity, Iran's 2017–2018 median income was equivalent to about $28,647 (2017
conversion factor, private consumption, LCU).

As the average Iranian household size is 3.5, this puts median personal income
at around $8,185. While Iran rates relatively well on income, median wealth is
very low for its income level, on par with Vietnam or Djibouti, indicating a
high level of spending. According to SCI, median household spending in 2018
was 393,227,000 rials, or 90.5% of the median household income of 434,905,000
rials.[_citation needed_]

After the Revolution, the composition of the middle class in Iran did not
change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15% of the population in
1979 to more than 32% in 2000. In 2008, the official poverty line in Tehran
for 2008 was $9,612. The national average poverty line was $4,932. In 2010,
Iran's Department of Statistics announced that 10 million Iranians live under
the absolute poverty line and 30 million live under the relative poverty line.

### State of income inequality

According the inequality dataset of the world bank, in 2002 the Gini index in
Iran was 34.8, a level that is considered to be quite modest. However, closer
data analysis reveals significant wealth concentration, with the top 10% of
earners holding 52.7% of the national income - a larger share than in the
United States or European countries.

Economic disparity is also evident within the public sector**.** Many Iranian
state employees face significant financial hardship, with salaries as low as
$200 per month, however, some Majlis representatives receive monthly salaries
ranging from 200 to 250 million tomans (or more than $59,172 according to the
exchange rate of January 2024). Additionally, they receive extra bonuses
during religious holidays and on "Parliament Day" and "Employee Day," along
with perquisites like Nowruz and Yalda Night snacks.

Inequality is also evident in access to essential services such as water
supply. In Tehran impoverished districts struggle with inadequate water
provision and hazardous water quality, while affluent areas, housing many of
the nation's economic elite, including high-ranking government and Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officials, are largely unaffected by these
shortages.

### Social security

Although Iran does not offer universal social protection, in 1996, the Iranian
Center for Statistics estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population
was covered by social security. Membership of the social security system for
all employees is compulsory.

Social security ensures employee protection against unemployment, disease, old
age and occupational accidents. In 2003, the government began to consolidate
its welfare organizations to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency. In 2003
the minimum standard pension was 50% of the worker's earnings but no less than
the minimum wage. Iran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social
welfare programs of which more than 50% covered pension costs. Out of the
15,000 homeless in Iran in 2015, 5,000 were women.

Employees between the age of 18 and 65 years are covered by the social
security system with financing shared between the employee (7% of salary), the
employer (20–23%) and the state, which in turn supplements the employer
contribution up to 3%. Social security applies to self-employed workers, who
voluntarily contribute between 12% and 18% of income depending on the
protection sought. Civil servants, the regular military, law enforcement
agencies, and IRGC have their own pension systems.

### Trade unions

Although Iranian workers have a theoretical right to form labor unions, there
is no union system in the country. Ostensible worker representation is
provided by the Workers' House, a state-sponsored institution that attempts to
challenge some state policies. Guild unions operate locally in most areas, but
are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right to strike
is generally not respected by the state. Since 1979 strikes have often been
met by police action.

A comprehensive law covers labor relations, including hiring of foreign
workers. This provides a broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it
covers, recognizing written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment
contracts. Considered employee-friendly, the labor law makes it difficult to
lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts (to
avoid paying benefits) is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a
serious offense. Labor disputes are settled by a special labor council, which
usually rules in favor of the employee.

## Sectors

### Agriculture and foodstuffs

Wheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest
whilst rice is the major crop in the Caspian region.

Agriculture contributes 9.5% to the gross domestic product and employs 17% of
the labor force. About 9% of Iran's land is arable, with the main food-
producing areas located in the Caspian region and in northwestern valleys.
Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while others
require irrigation. Primitive farming methods, overworked and under-fertilized
soil, poor seed and water scarcity are the principal obstacles to increased
production. About one third of total cultivated land is irrigated.
Construction of multipurpose dams and reservoirs along rivers in the Zagros
and Alborz mountains have increased the amount of water available for
irrigation. Agricultural production is increasing as a result of
modernization, mechanization, improvements to crops and livestock as well as
land redistribution programs.

Wheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest.
Rice is the major crop in the Caspian region. Other crops include barley,
corn, cotton, sugar beets, tea, hemp, tobacco, fruits, potatoes, legumes
(beans and lentils), vegetables, fodder plants (alfalfa and clover), almonds,
walnuts and spices including cumin and sumac. Iran is the world's largest
producer of saffron, pistachios, honey, berberis and berries and the second
largest date producer. Meat and dairy products include lamb, goat meat, beef,
poultry, milk, eggs, butter, and cheese.

Non-food products include wool, leather, and silk. Forestry products from the
northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are economically important. Tree-
cutting is strictly controlled by the government, which also runs a
reforestation program. Rivers drain into the Caspian Sea and are fished for
salmon, carp, trout, pike, and sturgeon that produce caviar, of which Iran is
the largest producer.

Since the 1979 revolution, commercial farming has replaced subsistence farming
as the dominant mode of agricultural production. By 1997, the gross value
reached $25 billion. Iran is 90% self-sufficient in essential agricultural
products, although limited rice production leads to substantial imports. In
2007 Iran reached self-sufficiency in wheat production and for the first time
became a net wheat exporter. By 2003, a quarter of Iran's non-oil exports were
of agricultural products, including fresh and dried fruits, nuts, animal
hides, processed foods, and spices. Iran exported $736 million worth of
foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000 tonnes) in 2010. A total of 12,198
entities are engaged in the Iranian food industry, or 12% of all entities in
the industry sector. The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or
16.1% of the entire industry sector's workforce.

### Manufacturing

Iran has a diversified and broad industrial base. In 1998, the United Nations
classified Iran's economy as "semi-developed".

Large-scale factory manufacturing began in the 1920s. During the Iran–Iraq
War, Iraq bombed many of Iran's petrochemical plants, damaging the large oil
refinery at Abadan bringing production to a halt. Reconstruction began in 1988
and production resumed in 1993. In spite of the war, many small factories
sprang up to produce import-substitution goods and materials needed by the
military.

Iran's major manufactured products are petrochemicals, steel and copper
products. Other important manufactures include automobiles, home and electric
appliances, telecommunications equipment, cement and industrial machinery.
Iran operates the largest operational population of industrial robots in West
Asia. Other products include paper, rubber products, processed foods, leather
products and pharmaceuticals. In 2000, textile mills, using domestic cotton
and wool such as _Tehran Patou_ and _Iran Termeh_ employed around 400,000
people around Tehran, Isfahan and along the Caspian coast.

A 2003 report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) identified the following
impediments to industrial development:

  * Lack of monitoring institutions;
  * Inefficient banking system;
  * Insufficient research & development;
  * Shortage of managerial skills;
  * Corruption;
  * Inefficient taxation;
  * Socio-cultural apprehensions;
  * Absence of social learning loops;
  * Shortcomings in international market awareness necessary for global competition;
  * Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures;
  * Shortage of skilled labor;
  * Lack of intellectual property protection;
  * Inadequate social capital, social responsibility and socio-cultural values.

Despite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and
technological fields, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace,
defense, and heavy industry. Even in the face of economic sanctions, Iran is
emerging as an industrialized country.

#### Handicrafts

Persian carpet

Iran has a long tradition of producing artisanal goods including Persian
carpets, ceramics, copperware, brassware, glass, leather goods, textiles and
wooden artifacts. The country's carpet-weaving tradition dates from pre-
Islamic times and remains an important industry contributing substantial
amounts to rural incomes. An estimated 1.2 million weavers in Iran produce
carpets for domestic and international export markets.[_citation needed_] More
than $500 million worth of hand-woven carpets are exported each year,
accounting for 30% of the 2008 world market. Around 5.2 million people work in
some 250 handicraft fields and contribute 3% of GDP.[_citation needed_]

#### Automobile manufacturing

Iran Khodro is the largest car manufacturer in the Middle-East. It has
established joint-ventures with foreign partners on 4 continents.

As of 2001, 13 public and privately owned automakers within Iran, led by Iran
Khodro and Saipa that accounted for 94% of domestic production. Iran Khodro's
Paykan, replaced by the Samand in 2005, is the predominant brand. With 61% of
the 2001 market, Khodro was the largest player, whilst Saipa contributed 33%
that year. Other car manufacturers, such as the Bahman Group, Kerman Motors,
Kish Khodro, Raniran, Traktorsazi, Shahab Khodro and others accounted for the
remaining 6%.

These automakers produce a wide range of vehicles including motorbikes,
passenger cars such as Saipa's Tiba, vans, mini trucks, medium-sized trucks,
heavy trucks, minibuses, large buses and other heavy automobiles used for
commercial and private activities in the country. In 2009 Iran ranked fifth in
car production growth after China, Taiwan, Romania and India. Iran was the
world's 12th biggest automaker in 2010 and operates a fleet of 11.5 million
cars. Iran produced 1,395,421 cars in 2010, including 35,901 commercial
vehicles.[_citation needed_]

#### Defense industry

In 2007 the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated Iran's
defense budget at $7.31 billion, equivalent to 2.6% of GDP or $102 per capita,
ranking it 25th internationally. The country's defense industry manufactures
many types of arms and equipment. Since 1992, Iran's Defense Industries
Organization (DIO) has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers,
guided missiles, radar systems, guided missile destroyers, military vessels,
submarines and fighter planes. In 2006 Iran exported weapons to 57 countries,
including NATO members, and exports reached $100 million. It has also
developed a sophisticated mobile air defense system dubbed as Bavar 373.

#### Construction and real estate

HEPCO motor grader (HG180D1) is working on road construction

Until the early 1950s construction remained in the hands of small domestic
companies. Increased income from oil and gas and easy credit triggered a
building boom that attracted international construction firms to the country.
This growth continued until the mid-1970s when a sharp rise in inflation and a
credit squeeze collapsed the boom. The construction industry had revived
somewhat by the mid-1980s, although housing shortages and speculation remained
serious problems, especially in large urban centers. As of January 2011, the
banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan, had loaned up to 102 trillion rials
($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing scheme. Construction is one of
the most important sectors accounting for 20–50% of total private investment
in urban areas and was one of the prime investment targets of well-off
Iranians.

Annual turnover amounted to $38.4 billion in 2005 and $32.8 billion in 2011.
Because of poor construction quality, many buildings need seismic
reinforcement or renovation. Iran has a large dam building industry.

#### Mines and metals

Mobarakeh in Isfahan is Iran's largest steel mill listed on the Tehran Stock
Exchange.

Mineral production contributed 0.6% of the country's GDP in 2011,[_citation
needed_] a figure that increases to 4% when mining-related industries are
included. Gating factors include poor infrastructure, legal barriers,
exploration difficulties, and government control over all resources. Iran is
ranked among the world's 15 major mineral-rich countries.

Although the petroleum industry provides the majority of revenue, about 75% of
all mining sector employees work in mines producing minerals other than oil
and natural gas. These include coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, chromium,
barite, salt, gypsum, molybdenum, strontium, silica, uranium, and gold, the
latter of which is mainly a by-product of the Sar Cheshmeh copper complex
operation. The mine at Sar Cheshmeh in Kerman Province is home to the world's
second largest store of copper. Large iron ore deposits exist in central Iran,
near Bafq, Yazd and Kerman. The government owns 90% of all mines and related
industries and is seeking foreign investment. The sector accounts for 3% of
exports.

In 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gypsum; the 8th
largest world producer of molybdenum; the world's 8th largest producer of
antimony; the 11th largest world producer of iron ore; the 18th largest world
producer of sulfur, in addition to being the 21st largest worldwide producer
of salt. It was the 13th largest producer in the world of uranium in 2018.

Iran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9 billion short tonnes. By
mid-2008, the country produced about 1.3 million short tonnes of coal annually
and consumed about 1.5 million short tonnes, making it a net importer. The
country plans to increase hard-coal production to 5 million tons in 2012 from
2 million tons in November 2008.

The main steel mills are located in Isfahan and Khuzestan. Iran became self-
sufficient in steel in 2009. Aluminum and copper production are projected to
hit 245,000 and 383,000 tons respectively by March 2009. Cement production
reached 65 million tons in 2009, exporting to 40 countries.

#### Petrochemicals

Iran's refining capacity (2007–2013 est.)

Iran manufactures 60–70% of its equipment domestically, including refineries,
oil tankers, drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and exploration instruments.

Based on a fertilizer plant in Shiraz, the world's largest ethylene unit, in
Asalouyeh, and the completion of other special economic zone projects, Iran's
exports in petrochemicals reached $5.5 billion in 2007, $9 billion in 2008 and
$7.6 billion during the first ten months of the Iranian calendar year 2010\.
National Petrochemical Company's output capacity will increase to over 100
million tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million tpa in 2010 thus becoming the
world' second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran
housing some of the world's largest chemical complexes.

Giant gas reactor of Yadavaran gas refinery designed and manufactured by
AzarAb Industries Corporation

Major refineries located at Abadan (site of its first refinery), Kermanshah
and Tehran failed to meet domestic demand for gasoline in 2009. Iran's
refining industry requires $15 billion in investment over the period 2007–2012
to become self-sufficient and end gasoline imports. Iran has the fifth
cheapest gasoline prices in the world leading to fuel smuggling with
neighboring countries.

In November 2019, Iran raised the gasoline prices by 50% and imposed a strict
rationing system again, as in 2007. The prices per liter gasoline rose to
15,000 rials, where only 60 liters were permitted to private cars for a month.
Besides, oil purchase beyond the limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter.
Those prices are still well below target prices set in the subsidy reform
plan, however. The policy changes came in effect to the US sanctions, and
caused protests across the country. The result of the rationing, a year later,
was reduced pollution and wasteful domestic consumption and increase in
exports.

### Services

Despite 1990s efforts towards economic liberalization, government spending,
including expenditure by quasi-governmental foundations, remains high.
Estimates of service sector spending in Iran are regularly more than two-
fifths of GDP, much government-related, including military expenditures,
government salaries, and social security disbursements. Urbanization
contributed to service sector growth. Important service industries include
public services (including education), commerce, personal services,
professional services and tourism.

The total value of transport and communications is expected to rise to $46
billion in nominal terms by 2013, representing 6.8% of Iran's GDP. Projections
based on 1996 employment figures compiled for the International Labour
Organization suggest that Iran's transport and communications sector employed
3.4 million people, or 20.5% of the labor force in 2008.

Countries by natural gas proven reserves, 2014, based on data from The World
Factbook. Iran has the world's second largest reserves after Russia

Iran possesses 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas
reserves. Domestic oil and gas along with hydroelectric power facilities
provide power. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars
per year, much higher than the international norm. Iran recycles 28% of its
used oil and gas, whereas some other countries reprocess up to 60%. In 2008
Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity. It is the
world's third largest consumer of natural gas after United States and Russia.
In 2010 Iran completed its first nuclear power plant at Bushehr with Russian
assistance.

Iran has been a major oil exporter since 1913. The country's major oil fields
lie in the central and southwestern parts of the western Zagros mountains. Oil
is also found in northern Iran and in the Persian Gulf. In 1978, Iran was the
fourth largest oil producer, OPEC's second largest oil producer and second
largest exporter. Following the 1979 revolution the new government reduced
production. A further decline in production occurred as result of damage to
oil facilities during the Iraq-Iran war.

Oil production rose in the late 1980s as pipelines were repaired and new Gulf
fields exploited. By 2004, annual oil production reached 1.4 billion barrels
producing a net profit of $50 billion. Iranian Central Bank data show a
declining trend in the share of Iranian exports from oil-products (FY 2006:
84.9%, 2007/2008: 86.5%, 2008/2009: 85.5%, 2009/2010: 79.8%, FY 2010 (first
three quarters): 78.9%). Iranian officials estimate that Iran's annual oil and
gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once current projects come on
stream.

Pipelines move oil from the fields to the refineries and to such exporting
ports as Abadan, Bandar-e Mashur and Kharg Island. Since 1997, Iran's state-
owned oil and gas industry has entered into major exploration and production
agreements with foreign consortia. In 2008 the Iranian Oil Bourse (IOB) was
inaugurated in Kish Island. The IOB trades petroleum, petrochemicals and gas
in various currencies. Trading is primarily in the euro and rial along with
other major currencies, not including the US dollar.[_citation needed_]
According to the Petroleum Ministry, Iran plans to invest $500 billion in its
oil sector by 2025.

#### Retail and distribution

Iran's retail industry consists largely of cooperatives (many of them
government-sponsored), and independent retailers operating in bazaars. The
bulk of food sales occur at street markets with prices set by the Chief
Statistics Bureau. Iran has 438,478 small grocery retailers. These are
especially popular in cities other than Tehran where the number of
hypermarkets and supermarkets is still very limited. More mini-markets and
supermarkets are emerging, mostly independent operations. The biggest
chainstores are state-owned Etka, Refah, Shahrvand and Hyperstar Market.
Electronic commerce in Iran passed the $1 billion mark in 2009.

In 2012, Iranians spent $77 billion on food, $22 billion on clothes and $18.5
billion on outward tourism. In 2015, overall consumer spending and disposable
income are projected at $176.4 billion and $287 billion respectively.

#### Healthcare and pharma

The constitution entitles Iranians to basic health care. By 2008, 73% of
Iranians were covered by the voluntary national health insurance system.
Although over 85% of the population use an insurance system to cover their
drug expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical
production/importation. The total market value of Iran's health and medical
sector was $24 billion in 2002 and was forecast to rise to $50 billion by
2013. In 2006, 55 pharmaceutical companies in Iran produced 96%
(quantitatively) of the medicines for a market worth $1.2 billion. This figure
is projected to increase to $3.65 billion by 2013.

#### Tourism and travel

Cyrus' tomb lies in Pasargadae. Iran is home to 19 historic sites which have
been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List.

Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has
subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004
and 2.3 million in 2009 mostly from Asian countries, including the republics
of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North
America.

The most popular tourist destinations are Mazandaran, Isfahan, Mashhad and
Shiraz. In the early 2000s the industry faced serious limitations in
infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training.
Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come
to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003 Iran
ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide. According to UNESCO and the deputy
head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is
rated among the "10 most touristic countries in the world". Domestic tourism
in Iran is one of the largest in the world.

#### Banking, finance and insurance

Government loans and credits are available to industrial and agricultural
projects, primarily through banks. Iran's unit of currency is the rial which
had an average official exchange rate of 9,326 rials to the U.S. dollar in
2007. Rials are exchanged on the unofficial market at a higher rate. In 1979,
the government nationalized private banks. The restructured banking system
replaced interest on loans with handling fees, in accordance with Islamic law.
This system took effect in the mid-1980s.

The Tehran Stock Exchange was one of the world's best performing stock
exchanges between 1999 and 2011.

The banking system consists of a central bank, the Bank Markazi, which issues
currency and oversees all state and private banks, as well as the Organization
of Islamic Economics which acts as a sort of central bank for issuing Qard al-
Hasan, as a parallel system in the banking sector, operating outside the
purview of the Central Bank. It supervises 1200, out of 2500 Islamic loan
funds, on behalf of Iran's Central Bank. Several commercial banks have
branches throughout the country. Two development banks exist and a housing
bank specializes in home mortgages. The government began to privatize the
banking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned
banks.

State-owned commercial banks predominantly make loans to the state, _bonyad_
enterprises, large-scale private firms and four thousand wealthy/connected
individuals. While most Iranians have difficulty obtaining small home loans,
90 individuals secured facilities totaling $8 billion.[_citation needed_] In
2009, Iran's General Inspection Office announced that Iranian banks held some
$38 billion of delinquent loans, with capital of only $20 billion.[_citation
needed_]

Foreign transactions with Iran amounted to $150 billion of major contracts
between 2000 and 2007, including private and government lines of credit. In
2007, Iran had $62 billion in assets abroad. In 2010, Iran attracted almost
$11.9 billion from abroad, of which $3.6 billion was FDI, $7.4 billion was
from international commercial bank loans, and around $900 million consisted of
loans and projects from international development banks.

As of 2010, the Tehran Stock Exchange traded the shares of more than 330
registered companies. Listed companies were valued at $100 billion in 2011.

Insurance premiums accounted for just under 1% of GDP in 2008, a figure partly
attributable to low average income per head. Five state-owned insurance firms
dominate the market, four of which are active in commercial insurance. The
leading player is the Iran Insurance Company, followed by Asia, Alborz and
Dana insurances. In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46%
of premiums, followed by health insurance (13%), fire insurance (10%) and life
insurance (9.9%).

#### Communications, electronics and IT

Broadcast media, including five national radio stations and five national
television networks as well as dozens of local radio and television stations
are run by the government. In 2008, there were 345 telephone lines and 106
personal computers for every 1,000 residents. Personal computers for home use
became more affordable in the mid-1990s, since when demand for Internet access
has increased rapidly. As of 2010, Iran also had the world's third largest
number of bloggers (2010).

In 1998, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph & Telephone, later renamed the
Ministry of Information & Communication Technology, began selling Internet
accounts to the general public. In 2006, revenues from the Iranian telecom
industry were estimated at $1.2 billion. In 2006, Iran had 1,223 Internet
Service Providers (ISPs), all private sector operated. As of 2014, Iran has
the largest mobile market in the Middle East, with 83.2 million mobile
subscriptions and 8 million smart-phones in 2012.

According to the World Bank, Iran's information and communications technology
sector had a 1.4% share of GDP in 2008. Around 150,000 people work in this
sector, including 20,000 in the software industry. 1,200 IT companies were
registered in 2002, 200 in software development. In 2014 software exports
stood at $400 million.[_citation needed_] By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom
market was the fourth-largest in the Middle East at $9.2 billion and was
expected to reach $12.9 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of
6.9%.

#### Transport

Iran has an extensive paved road system linking most towns and all cities. In
2011, the country had 173,000 kilometres (107,000 mi) of roads, of which 73%
were paved. In 2007 there were approximately 100 passenger cars for every
1,000 inhabitants. Trains operated on 11,106 kilometres (6,901 mi) of track.

Iran's major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After
arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed by trucks and freight trains.
The Tehran–Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to
Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar Anzali
and Bandar Torkaman on the Caspian Sea and Khoramshahr and Bandar Imam
Khomeini on the Persian Gulf.

Dozens of cities have passenger and cargo airports. Iran Air, the national
airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights.
All large cities have bus transit systems and private companies provide
intercity bus services. Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Tabriz, Ahvaz and Isfahan are
constructing underground railways. More than one million people work in the
transportation sector, accounting for 9% of 2008 GDP.

In August 2022, President Ebrahim Raisi's cabinet approved a law to import
fully assembled foreign cars. His predecessor President Hassan Rouhani, had
outlawed such imports in July 2018 due to sanctions imposed on Iran. Regular
Iranian citizens were unable to buy safe cars at affordable prices.

## International trade

Iran is a founding member of OPEC and the Organization of Gas Exporting
Countries. Petroleum constitutes 56% of Iran's exports with a value of $60.2
billion in 2018. For the first time, the value of Iran's non-oil exports is
expected to reach the value of imports at $43 billion in 2011. Pistachios,
liquefied propane, methanol (methyl alcohol), hand-woven carpets and
automobiles are the major non-oil exports. Copper, cement, leather, textiles,
fruits, saffron and caviar are also export items of Iran.

Technical and engineering service exports in FY 2007 were $2.7 billion of
which 40% of technical services went to Central Asia and the Caucasus, 30%
($350 million) to Iraq, and close to 20% ($205 million) to Africa. Iranian
firms have developed energy, pipelines, irrigation, dams and power generation
in different countries. The country has made non-oil exports a priority by
expanding its broad industrial base, educated and motivated workforce and
favorable location, which gives it proximity to an estimated market of some
300 million people in Caspian, Persian Gulf and some ECO countries further
east.

Total import volume rose by 189% from $13.7 billion in 2000 to $39.7 billion
in 2005 and $55.189 billion in 2009. Iran's major commercial partners are
China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. From
1950 until 1978, the United States was Iran's foremost economic and military
partner, playing a major role in infrastructure and industry modernization. It
is reported that around 80% of machinery and equipment in Iran is of German
origin. In March 2018, Iran had banned Dollar in trade. In July 2018, France,
Germany and the UK agreed to continue trade with Iran without using Dollar as
a medium of exchange.

Since the mid-1990s, Iran has increased its economic cooperation with other
developing countries in "South–South integration" including Syria, India,
China, South Africa, Cuba, and Venezuela. Iran's trade with India passed $13
billion in 2007, an 80% increase within a year.[_citation needed_] Iran is
expanding its trade ties with Turkey and Pakistan and shares with its partners
the common objective to create a common market in West and Central Asia
through ECO.[_citation needed_]

Since 2003, Iran has increased investment in neighboring countries such as
Iraq and Afghanistan. In Dubai, UAE, it is estimated that Iranian expatriates
handle over 20% of its domestic economy and account for an equal proportion of
its population. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than $2 billion
home in 2006. Between 2005 and 2009, trade between Dubai and Iran tripled to
$12 billion; money invested in the local real estate market and import-export
businesses, collectively known as the _Bazaar_ , and geared towards providing
Iran and other countries with required consumer goods. It is estimated that
one third of Iran's imported goods and exports are delivered through the black
market, underground economy, and illegal jetties, thus damaging the economy.

### Foreign direct investment

FDI stock in Iran (1980–2010)

In the 1990s and early 2000s, indirect oilfield development agreements were
made with foreign firms, including buyback contracts in the oil sector whereby
the contractor provided project finance in return for an allocated production
share. Operation transferred to National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) after a
set number of years, completing the contract.

Unfavorable or complex operating requirements and international sanctions have
hindered foreign investment in the country, despite liberalization of relevant
regulations in the early 2000s. Iran absorbed $24.3 billion of foreign
investment between the Iranian calendar years 1993 and 2007. The EIU estimates
that Iran's net FDI will rise by 100% between 2010 and 2014.

Foreign investors concentrated their activities in the energy, vehicle
manufacture, copper mining, construction, utilities, petrochemicals, clothing,
food and beverages, telecom and pharmaceuticals sectors. Iran is a member of
the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. In 2006, the
combined net worth of Iranian citizens abroad was about 1.3 trillion dollars.

According to the head of the Organization for Investment, Economic and
Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), in 2008 Iran ranked 142 among 181
countries in working conditions. Iran stands at number 96 in terms of business
start-ups, 165 in obtaining permits, 147 in employment, 147 in asset
registration, 84 in obtaining credit, 164 in legal support for investments,
104 in tax payments, 142 in overseas trade, 56 in contract feasibility and 107
in bankruptcy. Firms from over 50 countries invested in Iran between 1992 and
2008, with Asia and Europe the largest participants as shown below:

Continent of origin | Leading countries investing in Iran (1992–2008) | Number of projects | Total amount invested   
---|---|---|---  
Asia | India, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, Indonesia and Oman | 190 | $11.6 billion   
Europe | Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Turkey, Italy and France (20 countries in total) | 253 | $10.9 billion   
Americas | Canada, Panama, the US and Jamaica | 7 | $1.4 billion   
Africa | Mauritius, Liberia and South Africa | — | $8 billion   
Australia | Australia | 1 | $682 million   
  
The economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the
energy sector; _The New York Times_ reported that "consumer-oriented
companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81
million consumers, many of whom are young and prefer Western products". The
consumer-goods market is expected to grow by $100 billion by 2020.

In 2015, Iran was considered "a strong emerging market play" by investment and
trading firms. Opening Iran's market place to foreign investment could also be
a boon to competitive multinational firms operating in a variety of
manufacturing and service sectors, worth $600 billion to $800 billion in new
investment opportunities over the next decade.

### World Trade Organization

A map of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) member states

Iran has held observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since
2005. Although the United States has consistently blocked its bid to join the
organization, observer status came in a goodwill gesture to ease nuclear
negotiations between Iran and the international community. With exports of 60
products with revealed comparative advantage, Iran is the 65th "most complex
country".

Should Iran eventually gain membership status in the WTO, among other
prerequisites, copyrights will have to be enforced in the country. This will
require a major overhaul. The country is hoping to attract billions of
dollars' worth of foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment
climate through freer trade. Free trade zones such as Qeshm, Chabahar, and
Kish Island are expected to assist in this process. Iran allocated $20 billion
in 2010 to loans for the launch of twenty trade centers in other countries.

### International sanctions

See also Economic Recession in Iran

After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and
diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately
$11 billion of its assets. In 1996, the U.S. Government passed the Iran and
Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which prohibits U.S. (and non-U.S.) companies from
investing and trading with Iran in amounts of more than $20 million annually.
Since 2000 exceptions to this restriction have been made for items including
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.

Iran's nuclear program has been the subject of contention with the West since
2006 over suspicions of its intentions. The UN Security Council imposed
sanctions against select companies linked to the nuclear program, thus
furthering the country's economic isolation. Sanctions notably bar nuclear,
missile and many military exports to Iran and target investments in oil, gas
and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, as well as the
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banks, insurance, financial transactions
and shipping.

In 2012, the European Union tightened its own sanctions by joining the three
decade-old US oil embargo against Iran. In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a
deal on the nuclear program that will remove the main sanctions by early 2016.
Even though Iran can trade in its own currency some problems subsist mainly
due to the fact that it cannot transact in US dollars freely. Given its large
reserves of oil and gas, the Iranian rial could become a world reserve
currency if parity is established with oil and gas.[_citation needed_]

In 2018, the United States government unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA
agreement and re-imposed its sanctions on Iran's oil sales, petrochemicals,
shipping, metals trading and banking transactions.

#### Effects

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action allows Iran to purchase new planes.

According to U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns, Iran may be losing
as much as $60 billion annually in energy investment. Sanctions are making
imports 24% more costly on average. In addition, the latest round of sanctions
could cost Iran annually $50 billion in lost oil revenues. Iran is
increasingly using barter trade because its access to the international dollar
payment system has been denied. According to Iranian officials, large-scale
withdrawal by international companies represents an "opportunity" for domestic
companies to replace them.

The IEA estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000 bpd in
September 2012 from 2.2 million bpd at the end of 2011. This fall led to a
drop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency,
the rial, collapsed. September 2012 output was Iran's lowest since 1988.

The economic impacts of sanctions have been severe. Based on research, the
sanctions resulted in welfare losses across all income groups in Iran, with
wealthier groups suffering greater losses compared to poorer groups.
Additionally, income concentration and share within top income groups declined
post-sanctions.

According to the U.S. Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by
10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008
world oil price of $100/bbl).

According to NIAC, sanctions cost the United States over $175 billion in lost
trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities. Between 2010 and 2012, sanctions
cost the E.U. states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of
lost trade revenue. Germany was hit the hardest, losing between $23.1 and
$73.0 billion between 2010 and 2012, with Italy and France following at
$13.6-$42.8 billion and $10.9-$34.2 billion respectively.

GDP growth turned negative in 2013 (−5%). The unofficial unemployment rate was
20% by mid-2012. Oil exports dropped to 1.4 million bpd in 2014 from 2.5
million bpd in 2011. By 2013, Iran had $80 billion in foreign exchange
reserves frozen overseas. Automobile production declined 40% between 2011 and
2013. According to the U.S. government in 2015, Iran's economy has reached a
point where it is "fundamentally incapable of recovery" without a nuclear
accommodation with the West.

> The tentative rapprochement between Iran and the US, which began in the
> second half of 2013, has the potential to become a world-changing
> development, and unleash tremendous geopolitical and economic opportunities,
> if it is sustained […] if Iran and the US were to achieve a diplomatic
> breakthrough, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could decline
> sharply, and Iran could come to be perceived as a promising emerging market
> in its own right.

In January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the US for Iran's declining
economy. Following the US pullout from an international nuclear deal with Iran
and re-imposed sanctions, Iran faced the toughest economic situation in 40
years. According to Majlis, this has caused damages estimated between 150 and
200 billion dollars to the Iranian economy.

In August 2024, an Iranian group called IRLeaks attacked Iranian banks.
Politico described the attack as the "worst cyberattack" in Iranian history.
According to Politico, the Iranian government was forced to pay millions of
dollars to IRLeaks in ransom. Politico reported that 20 out of about 29
Iranian credit institutions fell in the attack. The Iranian supreme leader
blamed Israel and the United States without mentioning the cyberattack on the
banking system. Politico remarked it was plausible Israel or the US were
involved because of tensions with Israel as well as the Americans having
accused Iran of intervening in the American 2024 elections. Politico also
remarked that the group was made of freelance hackers and the attack was
likely carried out for monetary gain. TechCentral said the attack was probably
carried out by freelance hackers. An Iranian firm paid the hackers no less
than $3 million to IRLeaks to stop the attack and retrieve data.
