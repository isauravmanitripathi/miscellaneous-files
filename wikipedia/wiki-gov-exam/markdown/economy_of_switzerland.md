The **economy ofSwitzerland** is one of the world's most advanced and a
highly-developed free market economy. The economy of Switzerland has ranked
first in the world since 2015 on the Global Innovation Index and third in the
2020 Global Competitiveness Report. According to United Nations data for 2016,
Switzerland is the third richest landlocked country in the world after
Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Together with the latter and Norway, they are
the only three countries in the world with a GDP per capita (nominal) above
US$90,000 that are neither island nations nor ministates. Among OECD nations,
Switzerland holds the 3rd-largest GDP per capita. Switzerland has a highly
efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at
roughly 24.1% of GDP.

## History

### 19th century

Gotthard line in 1882 Development of real GDP per capita, 1851 to 2018

Switzerland as a federal state was established in 1848. Before that time, the
city-cantons of Zürich, Geneva, and Basel in particular began to develop
economically based on industry and trade, while the rural regions of
Switzerland remained poor and underdeveloped. While a workshop system had been
in existence throughout the early modern period, the production of machines
began in 1801 in St. Gallen, with the third generation of machines imported
from Great Britain. But in Switzerland, hydraulic power was often used instead
of steam engines because of the country's mountainous topography and lack of
significant deposits of coal. By 1814, hand weaving had been mostly replaced
by the power loom. Both tourism and banking began to develop as economic
factors at about the same time. While Switzerland was primarily rural, the
cities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused
especially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were
the leading industry. In 1888, women made up 44% of wage earners. Nearly half
the women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second
largest job category. The proportion of women in the workforce was higher
between 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Railways played a major part in industrialization; the first railway opened in
1847, between Zürich and Baden. Despite the competition between private
players, Switzerland was covered with more than 1000 km of track by 1860.
Nevertheless, the network was barely coordinated because of the decentralised
system.

### 20th century

The industrial sector began to grow in the 19th century with a laissez-faire
industrial/trade policy, Switzerland's emergence as one of the most prosperous
nations in Europe, sometimes termed the "Swiss miracle", was a development of
the mid 19th to early 20th centuries, among other things tied to the role of
Switzerland during the World Wars.

Switzerland's total energy consumption, which was dropping from the mid 1910s
to the early 1920s, started to increase again in the early 1920s. It stagnated
during the 1930s before falling again during the early 1940s; but rapid growth
started once again in the mid 1940s.

In the 1940s, particularly during World War II, the economy profited from the
increased export and delivery of weapons to Germany, France, the United
Kingdom, and other European countries. However, Switzerland's energy
consumption decreased rapidly. The co-operation of the banks with the Nazis
(although they also co-operated extensively with the British and French) and
their commercial relations with the Axis powers during the war were later
sharply criticised, resulting in a short period of international isolation of
Switzerland. Switzerland's production facilities were largely undamaged by the
war, and afterwards both imports and exports grew rapidly.

In the 1950s, annual GDP growth averaged 5% and Switzerland's energy
consumption nearly doubled. Coal lost its rank as Switzerland's primary energy
source, as other imported fossil fuels, such as crude and refined oil and
natural and refined gas, increased.

In the 1960s, annual GDP growth averaged 4% and Switzerland's total energy
consumption nearly doubled again. By the end of the decade oil provided over
three-quarters of Switzerland's energy.

In the 1970s the GDP growth rate gradually declined from a peak of 6.5% in
1970; GDP then contracted by 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became
increasingly dependent on oil imported from its main suppliers, the OPEC
cartel. The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy
consumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1978. In 1974 there were
three nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited as a
result of the oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew again, although
Switzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a
short-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption. In 1970 industry
still employed about 46% of the labor force, but during the economic recession
of the 1970s the services sector grew to dominate the national economy. By
1970 17.2% of the population and about one quarter of the work force were
foreign nationals, though job losses during the economic recession decreased
this number.

In the 1980s, Switzerland's economy contracted by 1.3% in 1982 but grew
substantially for the rest of the decade, with annual GDP growth between about
3% and 4%, apart from 1986 and 1987 when growth decreased to 1.9% and 1.6%
respectively.

Switzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the
weakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a
three-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The
contraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and
export growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase
(only 0.6% annually) in GDP.

After enjoying unemployment rates lower than 1% before 1990, the three-year
recession also caused the unemployment rate to rise to its all-time peak of
5.3% in 1997. In 2008, Switzerland was in second place among European
countries with populations above one million in terms of nominal and
purchasing power parity GDP per capita, behind Norway (see list). Several
times in the 1990s, real wages decreased since nominal wages could not keep up
with inflation. However, beginning in 1997, a global resurgence in currency
movement provided the necessary stimulus to the Swiss economy. It slowly
gained momentum, and peaked in the year 2000 with 3.7% growth in real terms.

### 21st century

In the early 2000s recession, being so closely linked to the economies of
Western Europe and the United States, Switzerland could not escape the
slowdown in these countries. After the worldwide stock market crashes in the
wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there were more announcements of false
enterprise statistics[_clarification needed_] and exaggerated managers' wages.
The rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.2% in 2001; 0.4% in 2002; and minus 0.2%
in 2003. This economic slowdown had a noticeable impact on the labour market.

Many companies announced mass dismissals and thus the unemployment rate rose
from its low of 1.6% in September 2000 to a peak of 4.3% in January 2004,
although well below the European Union (EU) rate of 9.2% at the end of 2004.

On 10 November 2002 the economics magazine _Cash_ suggested five measures for
political and economic institutions to implement to revive the Swiss economy:

1\. Private consumption should be promoted with decent wage increases. In
addition to that, families with children should get discounts on their health
insurance.

2\. Switzerland's national bank should revive investments by lowering interest
rates. Besides that, monetary institutions should increasingly credit
consumers[_clarification needed_] and offer cheaper land to be built on.

Euro to Swiss Franc exchange rate. In 2022, the Swiss National Bank reported a
record loss of CHF 132 billion ($142 billion), mostly on its holdings of the
Euro currency.

3\. Switzerland's national bank was asked to devalue the Swiss Franc,
especially compared to the Euro.

4\. The government should implement the anti-cyclical measure of increasing
budget deficits. Government spending should increase in the infrastructure and
education sectors. Lowering taxes would make sense in order to promote private
household consumption.

5\. Flexible work schedules should be instituted, thus avoiding low demand
dismissals.

These measures were applied with successful results while the government
strove for the _Magical Hexagon_ of full employment, social equality, economic
growth, environmental quality, positive trade balance and price stability. The
rebound which started in mid-2003 saw growth rate growth rate averaging 3%
(2004 and 2005 saw a GDP growth of 2.5% and 2.6% respectively; for 2006 and
2007, the rate was 3.6%). In 2008, GDP growth was modest in the first half of
the year while declining in the last two quarters. Because of the base effect,
real growth came to 1.9%. While it contracted 1.9% in 2009, the economy
started to pick up in Q3 and by the second quarter of 2010, it had surpassed
its previous peak. Growth for 2010 was 2.6%

The stock market collapse of 2007-2009 deeply affected investment income
earned abroad. This translated to a substantial fall in the surplus of the
current account balance. In 2006, Switzerland recorded a 15.1% per GDP
surplus. It went down to 9.1% in 2007 and further dropped to 1.8% in 2008. It
recovered in 2009 and 2010 with a surplus of 11.9% and 14.6% respectively.
Unemployment peaked in December 2009 at 4.4%. In August 2018 the unemployment
rate was 2.4%.

## Economic sectors

The Swiss economy follows the typical developed country model with respect to
the economic sectors. Only a small minority of the workers are involved in the
primary or agricultural sector (1.3% of the population, in 2006[update]) while
a larger minority is involved in the secondary or manufacturing sector (27.7%
in 2012[update]). The majority of the working population are involved in the
tertiary or services sector of the economy (71.0% in 2012[update]).[_dead
link_]

While most of the Swiss economic practices have been brought largely into
conformity with the European Union's policies, some trade protectionism
remains, particularly for the small agricultural sector.

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in
Switzerland is Services with 230,494 companies followed by Finance, Insurance,
and Real Estate and Retail Trade with 107,547 and 45,935 companies
respectively.

### Watches

Switzerland is a leading exporter of high-end watches and clocks. Swiss
companies produce most of the world's high-end watches: in 2011 exports
reached nearly 19.3 billion CHF, up 19.2% over the previous year. Watch
manufacturing is mostly located around the Jura mountains, in the cantons of
Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, and Jura. Notable watchmaking firms include
Rolex, Patek Philippe, Swatch, and Richemont.

The watches go to Asia (55%), Europe (29%), Americas (14%), Africa and Oceania
(both 1%).

In 2011, Switzerland led the world by exporting over US$20 billion value of
all types of watches, followed by Hong Kong, at under US$10 billion. China
exported the highest number of watches by far in 2011.

In July 2024, the Swatch Group loses 70% of its profit.

### Industrial sector

Switzerland has an extensive industrial sector, with globally competitive
companies in various industrial sectors. Most noticeably, food processing like
Nestlé, machines and robot manufacturers such as ABB, Bobst SA and Stadler
Rail, chemicals for industrial and construction use like Sika AG, or military
equipment such as Ruag.

Switzerland also has one of the most competitive pharmaceutical industries in
the world. Major Swiss pharmaceutical companies include Novartis and Roche.

### Agriculture

Swiss free-range cattle Emmentaler cheese. While some Swiss types are AOP
restricted, generic Emmentaler is produced around the world.

Switzerland is highly protective of its agricultural industry. High tariffs
and extensive domestic subsidisations encourage domestic production, which
currently produces about 60% of the food consumed in the country. Cheeses and
dairy are emblematic products of Swiss agriculture. Wine is another.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), Switzerland is subsidising more than 70% of its agriculture compared
to 35% in the EU. The _2007 Agricultural Program_ increased subsidies by CHF
63 million to CHF 14.092 billion.

Protectionism acts to promote domestic production, but not to reduce prices or
the cost of production, and there is no guarantee the increased domestic
production is actually consumed internally; it may simply be exported, to the
profit of the producers. 90 to 100% of potatoes, vegetables, pork, veal,
cattle and most milk products are produced in the country. Beyond that, Swiss
agriculture meets 65% of the domestic food demand. In 2016 the Swiss
government spent about 5.5% of its total budget (over CHF 3.5 billion) on
supporting food production.

The first reform in agricultural policies was in 1993. Among other changes,
since 1998 Switzerland has linked the attribution of farm subsidies with the
strict observance of good environmental practice. Before farmers can apply for
subsidies, they must obtain certificates of environmental management systems
(EMS) proving that they: "make a balanced use of fertilizers; use at least 7%
of their farmland as ecological compensation areas; regularly rotate crops;
adopt appropriate measures to protect animals and soil; make limited and
targeted use of pesticides." 1,500 farms are driven out of business each year.
But the number of organic farms increased by 3.3 percent between 2003 and
2004, and organic sales increased by 7 percent to $979 million. Moreover,
Swiss consumers consider less important the drawback of higher prices for
organic food compared to conventional locally produced food.

### Trade

The CIA World Factbook estimates Switzerland's 2011 exports at $308.3 billion
and the 2010 exports at $258.5 billion. Imports are estimated to be $299.6
billion in 2011 and $246.2 billion in 2010. According to the World Factbook
numbers, Switzerland is the 20th largest exporter and the 18th largest
importer.

The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database has lower numbers for
Switzerland's exports and imports. The UN calculates exports at $223.5 billion
in 2011 and $185.8 billion in 2010. The value of all imports in 2011 was
$197.0 billion and in 2010 it was $166.9 billion.

Switzerland's largest trading partner is Germany. In 2017, 17% of
Switzerland's exports and 20% of its imports came from Germany. The United
States was the second largest destination of exports (10% of total exports)
and the second largest source of imports (7.8%). China was the third largest
destination of exports (9.2%) but only provided 4.8% of imports.

The next largest destinations of exports include India (7.3%), France (5.4%),
Hong Kong (5.4%), the United Kingdom (4.5%) and Italy (4.4%). Other major
sources of imports include: Italy (7.6%), the United Kingdom (7.1%), France
(6.0%), China (mentioned above), the United Arab Emirates (3.7%) and Hong Kong
(3.4%).

As a developed country with a skilled labor force, the majority of Swiss
exports are precision or 'high tech' finished products. Switzerland's largest
specific SITC categories of exports include medicaments (13%), heterocyclic
compounds (2.2%), watches (6.4%), orthopaedic appliances (2.1%), and precious
jewellery (2.5%). While watches and jewellery remained an important part of
the economy, in 2017 about 24% of Swiss exports were gold bullion or coins.
Agricultural products that Switzerland is famous for such as cheese (0.23%),
wine (0.028%), and chocolate (0.35%) all make up only a small portion of Swiss
exports. Switzerland is also a significant exporter of arms and ammunition,
and the third largest for small calibers which accounted for 0.33% of the
total exports in 2012.

Switzerland's main imports include gold (21%), medicaments (7.4%), cars
(4.0%), precious jewellery (3.7%), and other unclassified transactions (18%).
While Switzerland has a long tradition of manufacturing cars, there are
currently no large-scale assembly line automobile manufacturers in the
country.

### Tourism

The Mont Cervin Palace in Zermatt

Switzerland has highly developed tourism infrastructure, especially in the
mountainous regions and cities, making it a good market for tourism-related
equipment and services.

14% of hotels were in Grisons, 12% each in the Valais and Eastern Switzerland,
11% in Central Switzerland and 9% in the Bernese Oberland. The ratio of
lodging nights in relation to resident population ("tourism intensity", a
measure for the relative importance of tourism to local economy) was largest
in Grisons (8.3) and Bernese Oberland (5.3), compared to a Swiss average of
1.3. 56.4% of lodging nights were by visitors from abroad (broken down by
nationality: 16.5% Germany, 6.3% UK, 4.8% USA, 3.6% France, 3.0% Italy)

The total financial volume associated with tourism, including transportation,
is estimated to CHF 35.5 billion (as of 2010) although some of this comes from
fuel tax and sales of motorway vignettes. The total gross value added from
tourism is 14.9 billion. Tourism provides a total of 144,838 full time
equivalent jobs in the entire country. The total financial volume of tourist
lodging is 5.19 billion CHF and eating at the lodging provides an additional
5.19 billion. The total gross value added of 14.9 billion is about 2.9% of
Switzerland's 2010 nominal GDP of 550.57 billion CHF.

In 2003, the financial sector comprised an estimated 11.6% of Switzerland's
GDP and employed approximately 196,000 people (136,000 of whom work in the
banking sector); this represents about 5.6% of the total Swiss workforce.

Swiss neutrality and national sovereignty, long recognized by foreign nations,
have fostered a stable environment in which the banking sector was able to
develop and thrive. Switzerland has maintained neutrality through both World
Wars, is not a member of the European Union, and was not even a member of the
United Nations until 2002. Currently an estimated 28 percent of all funds held
outside the country of origin (sometimes called "offshore" funds) are kept in
Switzerland. In 2009 Swiss banks managed 5.4 trillion Swiss Francs.

Most of the financial sector is centred in Zürich and Geneva. Zürich
specialises in banking (UBS, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer) as well as insurance
(Swiss Re, Zurich Insurance), whilst Geneva specialises in wealth management
(Pictet Group, Lombard Odier, Union Bancaire Privée), and commodity trading,
trade finance, and shipping (Cargill, Mediterranean Shipping Company, Louis
Dreyfus Company, Mercuria Energy Group, Trafigura, Banque de Commerce et de
Placements).

The Bank of International Settlements, an organization that facilitates
cooperation among the world's central banks, is headquartered in the city of
Basel. Founded in 1930, the BIS chose to locate in Switzerland because of the
country's neutrality, which was important to an organization founded by
countries that had been on both sides of World War I. In May 2006, foreign
banks operating in Switzerland managed 870 billion Swiss francs worth of
assets. In 2014, this number was estimated to be 960 billion Swiss francs.

In 2023, Switzerland lost credibility as a banking system after the collapse
of Credit Suisse, acquired by the Swiss competitor UBS, and the way the affair
was handled by the Swiss National Bank.

#### Connection to illegal activities

Swiss banks have served as safe havens for the wealth of dictators, despots,
mobsters, arms dealers, corrupt officials, and tax cheats of all kinds.

### Commodities trading

Switzerland is a major hub for commodities trading, globally. Commodities
trading represents 4% of Swiss GDP (2022). The range of products traded either
physically or financially include agriculture, minerals, metals and
oil/energy. Some 40% of all oil shipments are traded through Switzerland,
along with 60% of metals and grains (2022).

10,000 persons work in the commodity trade business in Switzerland (& 35,000
indirectly). Mostly around Lake Geneva, Zug and Lugano.

Corporate loans and revolving credit facilities granted to the five main Swiss
energy trading houses (Glencore, Mercuria, Gunvor, Vitol and Trafigura)
between 2013 and 2019 exceeded $360 billion.

Switzerland is also a major hub for gold trading with some of the largest
refiners including Valcambi, PAMP/MKS, Argor-Heraeus and Metalor.

Agricultural commodities trading is dominated by ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Cofco
and Louis Dreyfus. Shipping firm MSC, logistics company Kühne + Nagel and
Danzas and quality control firm SGS S.A. are also major players in this
sector.

This situation has enabled some types of organization in commodities trading
to be involved in corruption and exploitation and operate with little or no
transparency or oversight.

## Workforce

The Swiss economy is characterised by a skilled and generally 'peaceful'
workforce. One quarter of the country's full-time workers are unionised.
Labour and management relations are amicable, characterised by a willingness
to settle disputes instead of resorting to labour action. They take place
between trade unions and branch associations, that are themselves often
grouped in Union of Employers, like the Fédération patronale vaudoise or the
Fédération des Entreprises Romandes Genève. About 600 collective bargaining
agreements exist today in Switzerland and are regularly renewed without major
problems. However, there is no country-wide minimum wage across sectors, but
some collective bargaining agreement may contain minimum wage requirements for
specific sectors or employers. A May 2014 ballot initiative which would have
required a Swiss minimum wage to 22 Swiss francs an hour (corresponding to a
monthly income of about 4000 Swiss francs) failed to pass, gaining only 23.7%
support on the ballot. On 27 September 2020 voters in the Canton of Geneva
approved a minimum wage of 23 Swiss franc per hour or about 4,000 per month.

With the peak of the number of bankruptcies in 2003, however, the mood was
pessimistic. Massive layoffs and dismissals by enterprises resulting from the
global economic slowdown, major management scandals and different foreign
investment attitudes have strained the traditional Swiss labour peace. Swiss
trade unions have encouraged strikes against several companies, including
Swiss International Air Lines, Coca-Cola, and Orange. Total days lost to
strikes, however, remain among the lowest in the OECD.

A study estimated that Switzerland will have a short fall of hundreds of
thousands of workers by 2030. According to statistics, one in four Swiss has a
second job.

## Income and wealth distribution

In 2013 the mean household income in Switzerland was CHF 120,624 (c. USD
134,000 nominal, US$101,000 PPP), the mean household income after social
security, taxes and mandatory health insurance was CHF 85,560 (c. USD 95,000
nominal, US$72,000 PPP). The OECD lists Swiss household gross adjusted
disposable income per capita US$32,594 PPP for 2011.

As of 2016, Switzerland had the highest average wealth per adult, at $561,900.
The top 1% richest persons own 35% of all the wealth (2015).

The "net wealth" of Switzerland was $5.4 trillion as measured by the net worth
of its richest citizens. Among this group are 740 super-rich people with
assets of at least $100 million. Switzerland has 580,000 millionaires in total
which is 60,000 more than Germany with a population which is approximately 10
times larger.

US Dollar / Swiss Franc exchange rate

This development was tied to the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the
Swiss franc, which caused capital in Swiss francs to more than double its
value in dollar terms during the 2000s and especially during the 2008
financial crisis, without any direct increase in value in terms of domestic
purchasing power.

The high average wealth is determined by the few who are extremely wealthy;
the median (50th percentile) wealth of a Swiss adult is five times lower than
the average, at US$100,900 (US$70,000 PPP as of 2011).

The Statistical Office defines the majority of the population as “neither rich
nor poor and the average Swiss earns just enough to afford the high cost of
living in Switzerland”. According to some Swiss statistics "28% [of Swiss
families] have nothing left to save at the end of the month".

As of 2022, one in seven Swiss pensioners was living in poverty. Some 46,000
Swiss pensioners have already fallen into poverty and a further 295,000 are in
danger of joining them. The official poverty line is drawn at CHF2,279
($2,300) per month to pay for rent, health insurance, clothes and food.

About 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in
Switzerland as earning less than CHF3,990 per month for a household of two
adults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty.

## Economic policy

### Terrorism

Through the United States-Swiss Joint Economic Commission (JEC), Switzerland
has passed strict legislation covering anti-terrorism financing and the
prevention of terrorist acts, marked by the implementation of several anti-
money laundering procedures and the seizure of al-Qaeda accounts.

### European Union

Apart from agriculture, there are minimal economic and trade barriers between
the European Union and Switzerland. In the wake of the Swiss voters' rejection
of the European Economic Area Agreement in 1992, the Swiss Government set its
sights on negotiating bilateral economic agreements with the EU. Four years of
negotiations culminated in _Bilaterals_ , a cross-platform agreement covering
seven sectors: research, public procurement, technical barriers to trade,
agriculture, civil aviation, land transport, and the free movement of persons.
Parliament officially endorsed the Bilaterals in 1999 and it was approved by
general referendum in May 2000. The agreements, which were then ratified by
the European Parliament and the legislatures of its member states, entered
into force on June 1, 2002. The Swiss government then embarked on a second
round of negotiations, called the _Bilaterals II_ , approved by the Swiss
electorate on 5 June 2005, which further strengthens the country's economic
ties with the organisation.

Switzerland has since brought most of their practices into conformity with
European Union policies and norms in order to maximise the country's
international competitiveness. While most of the EU policies are not
contentious, police and judicial cooperation to international law enforcement
and the taxation of savings are controversial, mainly because of possible side
effects on bank secrecy.

Swiss and EU finance ministers agreed in June 2003 that Swiss banks would levy
a withholding tax on EU citizens' savings income. The tax would increase
gradually to 35% by 2011, with 75% of the funds being transferred to the EU.
Recent estimates value EU capital inflows to Switzerland to $8.3 billion.

## Institutional membership
