The **economy of Japan** is a highly developed mixed economy, often referred
to as an East Asian model. According to the IMF forecast for 2025, it will be
the fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP as well as by purchasing
power parity (PPP) by the end of the year. It constituted 3.7% of the world's
economy on a nominal basis in 2024. According to the same forecast, the
country's per capita GDP (PPP) will be $54,678 (2025). Due to a volatile
currency exchange rate, Japan's nominal GDP as measured in American dollars
fluctuates sharply.

A founding member of the G7 and an early member of the OECD, Japan was the
first country in Asia to achieve developed country status. In 2018, Japan was
the fourth-largest in the world both as an importer and as an exporter. The
country also has the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Japan used to run
a considerable trade surplus, but the decline of the manufacturing sector
since the 1980s and increased fossil fuel imports after the Fukushima nuclear
accident in 2011 have changed this trend in recent years. Being the world's
largest creditor nation, Japan has a considerable net international investment
surplus. The country has the world's second-largest foreign-exchange reserves,
worth $1.4 trillion. Japan has the third-largest financial assets in the
world, valued at $12 trillion, or 8.6% of the global GDP total as of 2020.
Japan has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which
comprises roughly 23.5% of GDP. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's third-
largest stock exchange by market capitalisation as of 2024.

Japan has a highly service-dominated economy, which contributes approximately
70% of GDP, with most of the remainder coming from the industrial sector. The
country's automobile industry, which is the second largest in the world,
dominates the industrial sector, with Toyota being the world’s largest
manufacturer of cars. Japan is often ranked among the world’s most innovative
countries, leading several measures of global patent filings. However, its
manufacturing industry has lost its world dominance since the 1990s. In 2022,
Japan spent around 3.7% of GDP on research and development. As of 2024, 40 of
the _Fortune Global 500_ companies are based in Japan.

Long having been an agricultural country, it has been estimated that Japan’s
economy was among the top ten in the world by size before the industrial
revolution started. Industrialisation in Japan began in the second half of the
19th century with the Meiji Restoration, initially focusing on the textile
industry and later on heavy industries. The country rapidly built its colonial
empire and the third most powerful navy in the world. After the defeat in the
Second World War, Japan’s economy recovered and developed further rapidly,
primarily propelled by its lucrative manufacturing exporting industries. It
became the second largest economy in the world in 1968 and remained so until
2010, and on a nominal per capita basis, the most high-income among the G7
countries in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, Japan’s share of the world’s
nominal GDP was 17.8%, reaching approximately 71% of that of the United
States.

Driven by speculative investments and excessive lending, the Japanese asset
price bubble of the early 1990s burst, triggering a prolonged period of
economic stagnation marked by deflation and persistently low or negative
growth, now known as the Lost Decades. From 1995 to 2023, the country’s GDP
fell from $5.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion in nominal terms. At the turn of the
21st century, the Bank of Japan set out to encourage growth through a policy
of quantitative easing, with the central bank purchasing government bonds at
an unprecedented scale to address the persisting deflationary pressure. In
2016, the Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest policy to stimulate
economic growth and combat persistent deflationary pressure. A combination of
domestic policies and global economic conditions helped the country achieve
its 2% inflation target, leading to the conclusion of the policy in 2024.

As of 2021, Japan has significantly higher public debt than other developed
nations, at approximately 260% of GDP. 45% of this debt is held by the Bank of
Japan, and most of the remainder is also held domestically. The Japanese
economy faces considerable challenges posed by an ageing and declining
population, which peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010 and has fallen to
122.6 million people in 2024. In 2022, the country's working age population
consisted of approximately 59.4% of the total population, which was the lowest
rate among all the OECD countries. According to 2023 government projections,
the country's population will fall to 87 million by 2070, with only 45 million
of working age.

## History

The economic history of Japan is one of the most studied. Major milestones in
modern Japan's economic progress include:

  * The foundation of the Tokugawa shogunate based in Edo (in 1603), initiating a period of internal economic development.
  * The Meiji Restoration (in 1868) leading to Japan becoming the first non-European modern world power.
  * Japan's defeat in World War II (in 1945), after which the island nation rose to become the world's second-largest economy.
  * The Lost Decades (the 1990s, 2000s and arguably 2010s), during which the country struggled to get out of deflation and extremely low or negative growth.

### Edo period (1603–1868)

The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban
trade period, marked by intense interaction with European powers. Japan built
its first Western-style warships, such as the _San Juan Bautista_, and
commissioned around 350 Red Seal Ships for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese
adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, were active throughout Asia.

To eradicate Christian influence, Japan entered a period of isolation called
_sakoku_ in the 1630s, which led to economic stability and mild progress. In
the 1650s, Japanese export porcelain production increased significantly due to
a civil war in China, mainly in Kyushu. This trade dwindled by the 1740s under
renewed Chinese competition but resumed after Japan’s mid-19th century
opening.

Economic development during the Edo period included urbanisation, increased
commodity shipping, and expanded domestic and foreign commerce. The
construction trades, banking facilities, and merchant associations flourished.
_Daimyō_-led authorities (_han_) oversaw rising agricultural production and
rural handicrafts. By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of over 1
million, while Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants,
becoming centres for trade and handicraft production. Rice, the economy’s
base, was taxed at about 40% of the harvest and sold at the fudasashi market
in Edo. _Daimyō_ used forward contracts similar to modern futures trading to
sell rice before harvest.

During the _sakoku_ period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques
(_rangaku_) through Dutch traders in Dejima, including geography, medicine,
natural sciences, astronomy, and mechanical sciences. Japan reopened its
economy to the West after being pressured by the United States twice in 1853
and 1854.

### Pre-war period (1868–1945)

Since the mid-19th century, after the Meiji Restoration, the country was
opened up to Western commerce and influence and went through a period of
economic development that extended through to the First World War. Economic
developments of the prewar period began with the "Rich State and Strong Army
Policy" by the Meiji government. During the Meiji period (1868–1912), leaders
inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent
thousands of students to Europe and the United States, and hired more than
3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign
languages in Japan (_Oyatoi gaikokujin_). The government also built an
extensive railway network, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform
program to prepare the country for further development.

To promote industrialisation, the government decided that, while it should
help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the private sector
was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of
government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In
short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early
Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to
entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew
rapidly into the larger conglomerates such as Mitsubishi. Government emerged
as chief promoter of private enterprise, enacting a series of pro-business
policies.

### Post-war period (1945–1989)

Japan underwent significant economic transformation and rapid recovery and
growth, emerging from the devastation of the Second World War to become a
global economic powerhouse. The immediate post-war period saw Japan slowly
recovering as a democratic nation under the Allied Occupation. The Korean War
(1950–1953), which happened in its now divided former colony, boosted the
economy, as Japan served as a major supply hub for U.S. forces. By the 1950s
and 1960s, Japan’s economy had entered a period of high growth, often referred
to as the 'Japanese Economic Miracle'. Key factors in this growth included
government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, advanced technology, and
a focus on export-oriented manufacturing. Japan’s economy diversified from
textiles to steel, shipbuilding, and eventually electronics and automobiles,
with companies such as Toyota, Sony, Hitachi and Honda becoming household
names worldwide.

In 1968, Japan became the world’s third-largest economy then the second
largest in the 1988, surpassing the economy of the Soviet Union. A position it
held until it was surpassed by China in 2010. The government played a crucial
role through policies that promoted industrial expansion and technological
advancement. Japan’s emphasis on quality control and continuous improvement
(_kaizen_) further boosted its international competitiveness. By the 1980s,
Japan was leading in a wide range of industries, including automotive and
consumer electronics, and was known for its formidable trade surplus and
wealth. However, the late 1980s also saw the infamous Plaza Accord and the
formation of an asset price bubble, with inflated real estate and stock market
prices, setting the stage for the economic stagnation of the 'Lost Decades'
that followed.

### Heisei period (1989–2019)

Japan's nominal GDP per capita stagnated around $40,000 for the entire period.

Growth slowed markedly in the late 1990s also termed the Lost Decade after the
collapse of Japanese asset price bubble. As a consequence Japan ran massive
budget deficits (added trillions in Yen to Japanese financial system) to
finance large public works programs.

By 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough
to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government
undertook "structural reform" policies intended to wring speculative excesses
from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led
Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of
Japan used quantitative easing to expand the country's money supply in order
to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the
policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect
inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems
to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an
annualised fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of
the US and European Union during the same period. Unlike previous recovery
trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor of growth.

Despite having interest rates down near zero for a long period of time, the
quantitative easing strategy did not succeed in stopping price deflation. This
led some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians, to
advocate the generation of higher inflation expectations. In July 2006, the
zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the
lowest interest rates in the developed world, but deflation had still not been
eliminated and the Nikkei 225 has fallen over approximately 50% (between June
2007 and December 2008). However, on 5 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced
that it would be purchasing 60–70 trillion yen in bonds and securities in an
attempt to eliminate deflation by doubling the money supply in Japan over the
course of two years. Markets around the world have responded positively to the
government's current proactive policies, with the Nikkei 225 adding more than
42% since November 2012. _The Economist_ has suggested that improvements to
bankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax laws will aid Japan's economy. In
recent years, Japan has been the top export market for almost 15 trading
nations worldwide.

In December 2018, a free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union
was cleared to commence in February 2019. It creates the world's largest free
trade zone valued at 1/3rd of global gross domestic product. This reduces
tariffs on Japanese cars by 10%, duties by 30% on cheese and 10% on wines and
opens service markets.

### Reiwa period (2020–present)

### 2020–21 recession

In early January 2020, Japanese economy began to suffer from the COVID-19
pandemic. In early April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state
of emergency. Less than a quarter of Japanese people expected living
conditions to improve in the coming decades. In October 2020 during the
pandemic, Japan and the United Kingdom formally signed the first free-trade
agreement post-Brexit, which will boost trade by approximately £15.2 billion.
It enables tariff-free trade on 99% of exports to Japan. On 15 February 2021,
the Nikkei average breached the 30k benchmark, the highest since November
1991. It was due to strong corporate earnings, GDP data and optimism over the
COVID-19 vaccination program in the country.

### Post-recession (2021–present)

At the end of March 2022, the Ministry of Finance announced that the national
debt reached precisely 1.017 million billion yen. The total public debt of the
country, which includes debts contracted by local governments, represents
1.210 million billion yen (9,200 billion dollars) which is nearly 250% of
Japan's GDP. Economist Kohei Iwahara said such an exceptional debt to GDP
level is only possible because Japanese hold most of the debt: "“Japanese
households hold most of their savings in bank accounts (48%) and these sums
are used by commercial banks to buy Japanese government bonds. Thus, 85.7% of
these bonds are held by Japanese investors.”

The Bank of Japan's main policy aim since the Lost Decades started had been to
end deflation and eventually achieve 2% inflation. The increased international
economic tension brought about by events such as the Russian Invasion of
Ukraine in 2022 finally helped the country achieve the much-anticipated
inflation target of 2%, and the negative interest policy since 2016 was ended
in March 2024. However, while other major economies focus on suppressing
inflation by raising interest rates, Japan aims to firmly establish inflation
by maintaining low rates. As a side effect, the Japanese yen has become
extremely weak, hitting a 37.5-year low of 161 yen/USD in July 2024.
Furthermore, the real effective exchange rate in May 2024, when the 2020
average is set at 100, is 68.65, the lowest level since the start of the Bank
of Japan statistics in January 1970, due to a combination of low inflation in
Japan and a relatively low trade share. This devaluation of the currency
caused Japan to lose its status as the world’s third largest economy to
Germany in nominal terms, which was approximately half the size of the
country's economy a decade earlier.

Factors such as an apparent end to the 30-year struggle against deflation,
improvements in corporate governance, and high corporate profits boosted the
stock market. Consequently, both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices surpassed
the record highs they reached more than 30 years ago in 2024. The market
capitalisation of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s prime section exceeded a
quadrillion yen for the first time in July 2024.

## Sectors of the economy

### Agriculture

Rice is a very important crop in Japan as shown here in a rice paddy in
Tawaramoto, Nara.

The Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.1% (2017) of the total
country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Due to
this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.
This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit
area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer
than 56,000 km2 (14 million acres) cultivated.

Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidised and
protected, with government regulations that favour small-scale cultivation
instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There has
been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a
difficult time finding successors.

Rice accounts for almost all of Japan's cereal production. Japan is the
second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. Rice, the most
protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.

Although Japan is usually self-sufficient in rice (except for its use in
making rice crackers and processed foods) and wheat, the country must import
about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops and relies on
imports for half of its supply of meat. Japan imports large quantities of
wheat and soybeans. Japan is the 5th largest market for the European Union's
agricultural exports.[_needs update_] Over 90% of mandarin oranges in Japan
are grown in Japan. Apples are also grown due to restrictions on apple
imports.

#### Fishery

Global fish catch in Japan

Japan ranked fourth in the world in 1996 in tonnage of fish caught. Japan
captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in
2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970,
5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total
aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's
total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted
for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s
although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.

Coastal fishing by small boats, set nets, or breeding techniques accounts for
about one third of the industry's total production, while offshore fishing by
medium-sized boats makes up for more than half the total production. Deep-sea
fishing from larger vessels makes up the rest. Among the many species of
seafood caught are sardines, skipjack tuna, crab, shrimp, salmon, pollock,
squid, clams, mackerel, sea bream, sauries, tuna and Japanese amberjack.
Freshwater fishing, including salmon, trout and eel hatcheries and fish farms,
takes up about 30% of Japan's fishing industry. Among the nearly 300 fish
species in the rivers of Japan are native varieties of catfish, chub, herring
and goby, as well as such freshwater crustaceans as crabs and crayfish. Marine
and freshwater aquaculture is conducted in all 47 prefectures in Japan.

Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for
nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is
leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked
controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.

### Industry

Japanese manufacturing and industry is very diversified, with a variety of
advanced industries that are highly successful. Industry accounts for 30.1%
(2017) of the nation's GDP. The country's manufacturing output is the third
highest in the world.

Industry is concentrated in several regions, with the Kantō region surrounding
Tokyo, (the Keihin industrial region) as well as the Kansai region surrounding
Osaka (the Hanshin industrial region) and the Tōkai region surrounding Nagoya
(the Chūkyō–Tōkai industrial region) the main industrial centers. Other
industrial centers include the southwestern part of Honshū and northern
Shikoku around the Seto Inland Sea (the Setouchi industrial region); and the
northern part of Kyūshū (Kitakyūshū). In addition, a long narrow belt of
industrial centers called the Taiheiyō Belt is found between Tokyo and
Fukuoka, established by particular industries, that have developed as mill
towns.

Japan enjoys high technological development in many fields, including consumer
electronics, automobile manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, optical
fibers, optoelectronics, optical media, facsimile and copy machines, and
fermentation processes in food and biochemistry. However, many Japanese
companies are facing emerging rivals from the United States, South Korea, and
Taiwan.

#### Automobile manufacturing

Lexus LS. The rapid growth and success of Toyota's Lexus and other Japanese
automakers reflects Japan's strength and global dominance in the automobile
industry.

Japan is the third biggest producer of automobiles in the world. Toyota is
currently the world's largest car maker, and the Japanese car makers Nissan,
Honda, Suzuki, and Mazda also count for some of the largest car makers in the
world. By number, Japan is the world's largest exporter of cars as of 2021.

### Mining and petroleum exploration

Japan's mining production has been minimal, and Japan has very little mining
deposits. However, massive deposits of rare earths have been found off the
coast of Japan. In the 2011 fiscal year, the domestic yield of crude oil was
820 thousand kiloliters, which was 0.4% of Japan's total crude processing
volume.

In 2019, Japan was the 2nd largest world producer of iodine, 4th largest
worldwide producer of bismuth, the world's 9th largest producer of sulfur and
the 10th largest producer of gypsum.

### Services

Japan Airlines, though faced with massive debts as of 2010, is considered one
of the largest airlines in the world.

Japan's service sector accounts for 68.7% (2017) of its total economic output.
Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and
telecommunications are all major industries such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho,
NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, Aeon, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR
East, Seven & i Holdings, KDDI and Japan Airlines counting as some of the
largest companies in the world. two of the five most circulated newspapers in
the world are Japanese newspapers. The Koizumi government set Japan Post, one
of the country's largest providers of savings and insurance services for
privatisation by 2015. The six major _keiretsus_ are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo,
Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa. Japan is home to 251 companies from
the Forbes Global 2000 or 12.55% (as of 2013).

#### Tourism

Himeji Castle, in Himeji, Hyōgo Prefecture, is one of the most visited sights
in Japan.

In 2012, Japan was the fifth most visited country in Asia and the Pacific,
with over 8.3 million tourists. In 2013, due to the weaker yen and easier visa
requirements for southwest Asian countries, Japan received a record 11.25
million visitors, which was higher than the government's projected goal of 10
million visitors. The government hopes to attract 40 million visitors a year
by the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Some of the most popular visited places
include the Shinjuku, Ginza, Shibuya and Asakusa areas in Tokyo, and the
cities of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto, as well as Himeji Castle. Hokkaido is also a
popular winter destination for visitors with several ski resorts and luxury
hotels being built there.

Japan's economy is less dependent on international tourism than those of other
G7 countries and OECD countries in general; from 1995 to 2014, it was by far
the least visited country in the G7 despite being the second largest country
in the group, and as of 2013 was one of the least visited countries in the
OECD on a per capita basis. In 2013, international tourist receipts was 0.3%
of Japan's GDP, while the corresponding figure was 1.3% for the United States
and 2.3% for France.

### Infrastructure

Shinkansen N700 Series

In 2018, Japan ranked 5th overall in the World Bank's Logistics Performance
Index, and 2nd in the infrastructure category.

In 2005, one half of Japan's energy was produced from petroleum, a fifth from
coal, and 14% from natural gas. Nuclear power in Japan made a quarter of
electricity production but due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster there
has been a large desire to end Japan's nuclear power program. In September
2013, Japan closed its last 50 nuclear power plants nationwide, causing the
nation to be nuclear free. The country has since then opted to restart a few
of its nuclear reactors.

Japan's spendings on roads has been considered large. The 1.2 million
kilometers of paved road are one of the major means of transportation. Japan
has left-hand traffic. A single network of speed, divided, limited-access toll
roads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises.
New and used cars are inexpensive, and the Japanese government has encouraged
people to buy hybrid vehicles. Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to
promote energy-efficiency.

Rail transport is a major means of transport in Japan. Dozens of Japanese
railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation
markets; for instance, 6 passenger JR enterprises, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu
Railway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain
real estate or department stores next to stations, and many major stations
have major department stores near them. The Japanese cities of Fukuoka, Kobe,
Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama all have subway
systems. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All
trains are known for punctuality, and a delay of 90 seconds can be considered
late for some train services.

There are 98 passenger and 175 total airports in Japan, and flying is a
popular way to travel. The largest domestic airport, Tokyo International
Airport, is Asia's second busiest airport. The largest international gateways
are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport
(Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Chūbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya
area). The largest ports in Japan include Nagoya Port, the Port of Yokohama,
the Port of Tokyo and the Port of Kobe.

About 84% of Japan's energy is imported from other countries. Japan is the
world's largest liquefied natural gas importer, second largest coal importer,
and third largest net oil importer. Given its heavy dependence on imported
energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources. Since the oil shocks of the
1970s, Japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from
77.4% in 1973 to about 43.7% in 2010 and increased dependence on natural gas
and nuclear power. In September 2019, Japan will invest 10 billion on
liquefied natural gas projects worldwide, in a strategy to boost the global
LNG market and reinforce the security of energy supply. Other important energy
source includes coal, and hydroelectricity is Japan's biggest renewable energy
source. Japan's solar market is also currently booming. Kerosene is also used
extensively for home heating in portable heaters, especially farther north.
Many taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied natural gas. A recent
success towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass-produced
hybrid vehicles. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, who was working on Japan's
economic revival, signed a treaty with Saudi Arabia and UAE about the rising
prices of oil, ensuring Japan's stable deliveries from that region.

## Finance

The main trading room of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock
exchanges in the world

The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the third largest stock exchange in the world by
market capitalisation, as well as the 2nd largest stock market in Asia, with
2,292 listed companies. The Nikkei 225 and the TOPIX are the two important
stock market indexes of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and
the Osaka Stock Exchange, another major stock exchange in Japan, merged on 1
January 2013, creating one of the world's largest stock exchanges. Other stock
exchanges in Japan include the Nagoya Stock Exchange, Fukuoka Stock Exchange
and Sapporo Securities Exchange.

## Labor force

Unemployment rate of Japan. Red line is G7 average.  
15-24 age (thin line) is youth unemployment.

The unemployment rate in December 2013 was 3.7%, down 1.5 percentage points
from the claimed unemployment rate of 5.2% in June 2009 due to the strong
economic recovery.

In 2008 Japan's labor force consisted of some 66 million workers—40% of whom
were women—and was rapidly shrinking. One major long-term concern for the
Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. In 2005, the number of deaths in
Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population
had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would
be to increase immigration, Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants
despite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled
workers) compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when
looking at Japan's work visa programme for "specified skilled worker", which
had less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000
overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting
migrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration
policies. A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to
Japan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country's low
migrant inflow.

In 1989, the predominantly public sector union confederation, SOHYO (General
Council of Trade Unions of Japan), merged with RENGO (Japanese Private Sector
Trade Union Confederation) to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation.
Labor union membership is about 12 million.

As of 2019 Japan's unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7. Its employment
rate for the working-age population (15–64) was the highest in the G7.

## Law and government

Japan ranks 27th of 185 countries in the ease of doing business index 2013\.

Japan has one of the smallest tax rates in the developed world. After
deductions, the majority of workers are free from personal income taxes.
Consumption tax rate is 10%, while corporate tax rates are high, second
highest corporate tax rate in the world, at 36.8%. However, the House of
Representatives has passed a bill which increased the consumption tax to 10%
in October 2015. The government has also decided to reduce corporate tax and
to phase out automobile tax.

In 2016, the IMF encouraged Japan to adopt an income policy that pushes firms
to raise employee wages in combination with reforms to tackle the labor market
dual tiered employment system to drive higher wages, on top of monetary and
fiscal stimulus. Shinzo Abe has encouraged firms to raise wages by at least
three per cent annually (the inflation target plus average productivity
growth).

Shareholder activism is rare despite the fact that the corporate law gives
shareholders strong powers over managers. Under Prime Minister Shinzō Abe,
corporate governance reform has been a key initiative to encourage economic
growth. In 2012, only around 40% of leading Japanese companies had any
independent directors; by 2016, the majority had begun to appoint independent
directors.

The government's liabilities include the second largest public debt of any
nation with debt of over one quadrillion yen, or 8,535,340,000,000 in USD.
Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called the situation 'urgent'.

Japan's central bank has the second largest foreign-exchange reserves after
the People's Republic of China, with over one trillion US Dollars in foreign
reserves.

### Overview

_Nemawashi_ (根回し), 'consensus building', in Japanese culture is an informal
process of quietly laying the foundation for some proposed change or project,
by talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so
forth. It is considered an important element in any major change, before any
formal steps are taken, and successful _nemawashi_ enables changes to be
carried out with the consent of all sides.

Japanese companies are known for management methods such as "The Toyota Way".
_Kaizen_ (改善, Japanese for 'improvement') is a Japanese philosophy that
focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied
to the workplace, _kaizen_ activities continually improve all functions of a
business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly
line workers. By improving standardised activities and processes, Kaizen aims
to eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). _Kaizen_ was first implemented in
several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II,
including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. The
corporate application of the _kaizen_ system has been criticised for
neglecting or harming the quality of life of workers, particularly via the
implementation of long working hours. However, according to the OECD, Japan's
average for annual hours worked per employee is lower than the OECD average
and middling among G7 countries.

Some companies have powerful enterprise unions and _shuntō_. The _nenko_
system or _nenko joretsu_ as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of
preferring to promote employees close to retirement. This is done to
prioritise experience in executive positions and to allow older employees to
achieve a higher salary level before retirement. The _nenko_ system has been
criticised for leaving younger employees at a disadvantage against older
employees who may be less capable.

Relationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close.
Amakudari (天下り, _amakudari_ , 'descent from heaven') is the institutionalised
practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in
the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt
and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the
state that prevent economic and political reforms. Lifetime employment
(_shūshin koyō_) and seniority-based career advancement have been common in
the Japanese work environment. These practices have become less common in
recent years.

Salaryman (サラリーマン, __Sararīman__ , salaried man) refers to someone whose
income is salary-based; particularly those working for corporations. Coined in
Japan, the word's frequent use by Japanese corporations and its prevalence in
Japanese manga and anime has led to its adoption into and common usage within
the English language to refer to Japanese white-collar workers, and it can be
found in many English-language books and articles pertaining to Japanese
culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed
as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term
carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate
hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, wage
slavery, and _karōshi_. The term _salaryman_ refers almost exclusively to
males.[_citation needed_]

An office lady, often abbreviated OL (Japanese: オーエル _Ōeru_), is a female
office worker in Japan who performs generally pink collar tasks such as
serving tea and doing secretarial or clerical work. Like many unmarried
Japanese, OLs often live with their parents well into early adulthood. Office
ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, with little opportunity for
promotion, and there is often a tacit expectation that they leave their jobs
if they get married.[_citation needed_]

Freeter (フリーター, _furītā_) is a Japanese expression for people between the age
of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding
homemakers and students. They may also be described as _underemployed_ or
freelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or
university but instead usually live as parasite singles with their parents and
earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. Low income makes it
difficult for freeters to start a family, and lacking qualifications in the
form of skilled labor experience makes it difficult for them to start a career
at a later point in life.[_citation needed_]

Karōshi (過労死, __karōshi__), which can be translated quite literally from
Japanese as "death from overwork", is occupational sudden death. The major
medical causes of karōshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.

Sōkaiya (総会屋, _sōkaiya_), (sometimes also translated as 'corporate bouncers',
'meeting-men', or 'corporate blackmailers') are a form of specialised
racketeer unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza, who extort
money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate
companies and their management, usually in their annual meeting (総会, _sōkai_).
Sarakin (サラ金) is a Japanese term for 'moneylender' or 'loan shark'. It is a
contraction of the Japanese words for 'salaryman' and 'cash'. Around 14
million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a
_sarakin_. In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade
ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of
outstanding loans totals 100 billion. The biggest _sarakin_ are publicly
traded and often allied with big banks.

The first "Western-style" department store in Japan (called デパート, _depāto_)
was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called
Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an
even longer history, dating back to 1611 and becoming a department store in
1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn
indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department
stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold luxurious
products which contributed to them having sophisticated atmospheres. From the
1920s, private railway operators started to build department stores directly
linked to their lines' terminuses. Seibu and Hankyu are examples of this
practice. From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores have faced fierce
competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, and they have gradually
declined in prominence. Still, _depāto_ are seen as bastions of cultural
conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for department stores are
frequently given as presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally
offer a wide range of services which can include foreign exchange, travel
reservations, and ticket sales for local concerts and other events.[_citation

## _Keiretsu_

A _keiretsu_ (系列, 'system' or 'series') is a set of companies with
interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. A _keiretsu_
unequivocally exists as an identical form of business structure to the
_affiliate_, or an associate.[_citation needed_] It is a type of business
group. The prototypical _keiretsu_ appeared in Japan during the "economic
miracle" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry
was controlled by large family-controlled vertical monopolies called
_zaibatsu_. The Allies dismantled the _zaibatsu_ in the late 1940s, but the
companies formed from the dismantling of the _zaibatsu_ were reintegrated. The
dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form
horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible,
_keiretsu_ companies would also supply one another, making the alliances
vertically integrated as well. In this period, official government policy
promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand
pressures from intensified world trade competition.

The major _keiretsu_ were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the
_keiretsu_ 's member companies and held equity positions in the companies.
Each central bank had great control over the companies in the _keiretsu_ and
acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect
of this structure was to minimise the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan,
because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.[_citation needed_]

There are two types of _keiretsu_ : vertical and horizontal. Vertical
_keiretsu_ illustrates the organisation and relationships within a company
(for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected),
while a horizontal _keiretsu_ shows relationships between entities and
industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are
complexly woven together and sustain each other.

The Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the _keiretsu_.
Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to
merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between
the _keiretsu_ : Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the
Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, now known as
MUFG Bank. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such
as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.[_citation
needed_]

Generally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community
that the old _keiretsu_ system was not an effective business model, and led to
an overall loosening of _keiretsu_ alliances. While the _keiretsu_ still
exist, they are not as centralised or integrated as they were before the
1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in
Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily "bailed out" by their
banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent
shareholders.[_citation needed_]

## Mergers and acquisitions

Japanese companies have been involved in 50,759 deals between 1985 and 2018.
This cumulates to a total value of US$2.636 billion which translates to
¥281.469 trillion. In 1999, there was an all-time high in terms of value of
deals with almost US$220 billion. The most active year so far was 2017 with
over 3,150 deals, but only a total value of US$114 billion (see graph "M&A in
Japan by number and value").[_citation needed_]

Here is a list of the most important deals (ranked by value in US$ [billion])
