The **economy of Romania** is a developing mixed economy, with a high degree
of complexity. It ranks 12th in the European Union by total nominal GDP and
7th largest when adjusted by purchasing power (PPP). The World Bank notes that
Romania's efforts are focused on accelerating structural reforms and
strengthening institutions in order to further converge with the European
Union. The country's economic growth has been one of the highest in the EU
since 2010, with 2022 seeing a better-than-expected 4.8% increase.

In recent years, it witnessed growth rates such as: 4.8% in 2016, 7.1% in
2017, 4.4% in 2018 and 4.1% in 2019. In 2020, its GDP per capita in purchasing
power standards reached 72% of the European Union average, up from 44% in
2007, the highest growth rate in the EU27. Romania's economy ranks 35th in the
world by its total GDP (PPP), with a Int$784 billion annual output (2023
est.).

The country is a leading destination in Central and Eastern Europe for foreign
direct investment: the cumulative FDI since 1989 totals more than $170
billion. Romania is the largest electronics producer in the region. In the
past 20 years Romania has also grown into a major center for mobile
technology, information security, and related hardware research. The country
is a regional leader in fields such as IT and motor vehicle production.
Bucharest, the capital city, is one of the leading financial and industrial
centres in Eastern Europe.

## History

### Before World War II

The economy of Romania entered modernity with the Treaty of Adrianople in
1829, ending centuries of Turkish control. Economic growth was stimulated by
several milestones: the discovery and industrial exploitation of oil in 1857,
the political union between Wallachia and Moldavia in 1859, land reforms,
adoption of a local currency, the leu (1867), the state independence (1877),
as well as the building of an extensive rail-road system under king Carol I.

After the dissolution of neighbouring Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires
following World War I, several Romanian-speaking provinces (Transylvania,
Bessarabia, Banat, Bukovina) united with the Kingdom of Romania, forming the
Romanian state in its modern form. The application of radical agricultural
reforms and the passing of a new constitution created a democratic framework
and allowed for quick economic growth (industrial production doubled between
1923 and 1938, despite the effects of the Great Depression in Romania).

Until World War II, Romania was Europe's second-largest oil and food producer.

### Communist period

After 1945, Soviet-occupied Romania became a member of the Eastern Bloc and
switched to a Soviet-style command economy. During this period the country
experienced rapid industrialisation in an attempt to create a "multilaterally
developed socialist society". Economic growth was further fuelled by foreign
credits in the 1970s, eventually leading to a growing foreign debt, which
peaked at $11–12 billion.

Romania's debt was completely paid off during the 1980s by implementing severe
austerity measures which deprived Romanians of basic consumer goods. In 1989,
before the Romanian Revolution, Romania had a GDP of about 800 billion lei, or
$53.6 billion. Around 58% of the country's gross national income came from
industry, and another 15% came from agriculture. The minimum wage was 2,000
lei, or approx. $57.

### Free market transition

The end of the communist period marked the beginning of a sharp economic
downturn. Romania's weight in the global economy dropped to 0.3% in 1993, down
from 0.8% in 1983.

Privatisation of industry started with the 1992 transfer of 30% of the shares
of some 6,000 state-owned enterprises to five private ownership funds, in
which each adult citizen received certificates of ownership. The remaining 70%
ownership of the enterprises was transferred to a state ownership fund, with a
mandate to sell off its shares at the rate of at least 10% per year. The
privatisation law also called for direct sale of some 30 specially selected
enterprises and the sale of "assets" (i.e., commercially viable component
units) of larger enterprises.

As of 2008, inflation stood at 7.8%, up from 4.8% in 2007 estimated by the BNR
at coming within 6% for the year 2006 (the year-on-year CPI, published in
March 2007, is 3.66%). Also, since 2001, the economy has grown steadily at
around 6–8%. Therefore, the PPP per capita GDP of Romania in 2008 was
estimated to be between $12,200 and $14,064.

Romania was the largest U.S. trading partner in Central-Eastern Europe until
Nicolae Ceaușescu's 1988 renunciation of Most Favored Nation (non-
discriminatory) trading status, which resulted in higher U.S. tariffs on
Romanian products. Congress approved restoration of the MFN status effective 8
November 1993, as part of a new bilateral trade agreement. Tariffs on most
Romanian products dropped to zero in February 1994 with the inclusion of
Romania in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Major Romanian exports
to the U.S. include shoes and clothing, steel, and chemicals.

Romania signed an Association Agreement with the EU in 1992 and a free trade
agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1993, codifying
Romania's access to European markets and creating the basic framework for
further economic integration. Romania formally joined the EU in 2007.

During the later part of the Ceaușescu period, Romania had earned significant
contracts from several developing countries, notably Iraq, for oil-related
projects. In August 2005 Romania agreed to forgive 43% of the US$1.7 billion
debt owed by an Iraq still largely occupied by the military forces of the
U.S.-led "Coalition of the Willing", making Romania the first country outside
of the Paris Club of wealthy creditor nations to forgive Iraqi debts.

Growth in 2000–07 was supported by exports to the EU, primarily to Italy and
Germany, and a strong recovery of foreign and domestic investment. Domestic
demand is playing an ever more important role in underpinning growth as
interest rates drop and the availability of credit cards and mortgages
increases. Current account deficits of around 2% of GDP are beginning to
decline[_citation needed_] as demand for Romanian products in the European
Union increases. Accession to the EU gives further impetus and direction to
structural reform.

In early 2004 the government passed increases in the value-added tax (VAT) and
tightened eligibility for social benefits with the intention to bring the
public finance gap down to 4% of GDP by 2006, but more difficult pension and
healthcare reforms will have to wait until after the next elections.
Privatisation of the state-owned bank Banca Comercială Română took place in
2005. Intensified restructuring among large enterprises, improvements in the
financial sector, and effective use of available EU funds is expected to
accelerate economic growth. However, the Romanian economy was affected by the
2008 financial crisis and contracted in 2009.

After communism, Romania needed capital infusion, entrepreneurial and
managerial skills, the fastest way to obtain that was through foreign direct
investment (FDI). As of 2018, total FDI in Romania was 81 billion EUR, 63% of
total (51 billion) are greenfield investments. Top ten FDI stock by country of
origin in 2018 were: Netherlands (23.9%), Germany (12.7%), Austria (12.2%),
Italy (9.5%), Cyprus (6.2%), France (6%), Switzerland (4.5%), Luxembourg
(4.2%), Belgium (2.2%) and United Kingdom (2.1%).

### Investments in Romania

The level of investment remains above EU average. Investment accounts for
almost 25% of GDP in Romania as opposed to 19% of GDP in the EU, in 2016.

Locally, UniCredit, one of the region's leading banking firms, announced in
October 2023 that it will merge its Romanian affiliate with the recently
purchased Alpha bank in Romania (for €300 million), creating Romania's third-
largest lender.

Romania's Recovery and Resilience Plan dedicates over €6 billion to
digitalisation efforts, encompassing public administration, connectivity,
cybersecurity, digital skills, and the development of an integrated e-health
and telemedicine system. The European Investment Bank Project Advisory Support
programme aids Romania in advancing digitalisation through collaborations with
the National Agency for Public Procurement and the Ministry of Research,
Innovation, and Digitalisation

This assistance includes evaluating ICT projects and supporting the rollout of
a €600 million government cloud initiative, aimed at enhancing
interoperability, reducing bureaucracy, and bolstering cybersecurity.

On 1 January 2007 Romania and Bulgaria entered the EU, giving the Union access
to the Black Sea. This led to some immediate international trade
liberalisation. Romania is part of the European single market which represents
more than 447 million consumers. Several domestic commercial policies are
determined by agreements among European Union members and by EU legislation.
This is to be contrasted with enormous current account deficits. Low interest
rates guarantee availability of funds for investment and consumption. For
example, a boom in the real estate market started around 2000 and has not
subsided yet. At the same time annual inflation in the economy is variable and
during the mid-2000s (2003–2008) has seen a low of 2.3% and high of 7.8%.

Romania adopted 1 January 2005 a flat tax of 16% to improve tax collection
rates. Romania subsequently enjoyed the lowest fiscal burden in the European
Union, until Bulgaria also switched to a flat tax of 10% in 2007. Since 2018
the flat rate was lowered to 10%.

Romania posted 6% economic growth in 2016, the highest among European Union
member states. According to Bloomberg, the country's economic growth advanced
at the fastest pace since 2008. It is now considered the next tech-startup hub
country in EU. Nowadays, that Romania's digital infrastructure ranks higher
than other eastern and central European countries makes it an attractive place
to start a tech business.

### GDP

IMF for 2022 (October) published the following data:

Year | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
$/per capita (PPP) | 38 | 40,673 | 43,100 | 45,445 | 47,940 | 50,573   
$/per capita (Nominal) | 15 | 16,228 | 17,566 | 18,935 | 20,263 | 21,665   
  
In the Romanian press the economy has been referred to as the "Tiger of the
East" during the 2000s. Romania is a country of considerable economic
potential: over 10 million hectares of agricultural land, diverse energy
sources (coal, oil, natural gas, hydro, nuclear, and wind), a substantial, if
aging, manufacturing base and opportunities for expanded development in
tourism on the Black Sea and in the mountains.

### Investments

Net investments in Romania's economy totaled RON 33.6 billion (EUR 7.2
billion) in the first half of 2018, up by 5.8% compared to the same period of
2017, according to the National Statistics Institute (INS).

In the same year (2018) foreign direct investment (FDI) was 81 billion, 63%
(51 billion) being "green field"

### National budget

The planned national budget for 2017 is 422 billion lei ($103 billion), with
an estimated budget deficit to GDP of 1.1%.

### Growing middle class

Romania has a growing middle and upper classes with relatively high per-capita
income. World Bank estimated that in 2002 99% of the urban and 94% of the
rural population had access to electricity. In 2004, 91% of the urban and only
16% of the rural population had access to improved water supply and 94% of the
urban population had access to improved sanitation. In 2017 there were about
22.5 million mobile phone users in Romania and about 18 million with internet
access.

In February 2024, the gross average monthly wage was RON 8,871 (€1910), and
the net average monthly wage was RON 5,556 (€1180).

### Neighbours

Countries tend to benefit from sharing borders with developed markets as this
facilitates trade and development. Below is a table of Romania's neighbouring
countries, their GDP per capita, and trade values between the pairs. In 2017,
11.58% of Romanian exports went to its neighbours; while 12.95% of imports
came from these five countries. For comparison, Germany alone accounted for
23% of Romania's exports and 20.1% of its imports.

## Labour

In 2022, the economically active population was of 8270.8 thousand persons, of
which 94.4% were employed persons and 5.6% unemployed.

The employment rate of working age population (15-64 years) was 63.1%, having
higher values for men (71.5%, as against 54.4% for women) and urban area
(68.6% in urban area, as against 56.3% in rural area). 19.7% of young people
(aged 15-24 years) and 46.7% of elderly people (aged 55-64 years) were
employed. The employment rate for persons aged 15-64 was higher for those with
superior level of education (89.5%) than for those with medium level (64.6%)
and those with low education (36.6%). The employment rate for the population
aged 20-64 years was 68.5%. Employment rate had higher values for men (77.7%
as against only 59.1% for women) and for persons in urban area (74.0% as
against 61.8% for persons in rural area).

The unemployment rate was 5.6%. By gender, the gap between the two rates was
1.0 percentage point (6.0% for men as against 5.0% for women), while by
residential area it was 5.7 percentage points (8.9% for rural area as compared
to 3.2% for urban area). The unemployment rate had the highest level (22.8%)
among young people (aged 15-24 years). The unemployment affects to a greater
extent the graduates of medium and low level of education, for which the
unemployment rate was 5.2%, respectively 14.2% higher as compared with the
rate registered for unemployed with superior level of education (1.7%).

### Minimum wage in Romania

The minimum gross wage in the Romanian economy amounts to RON 4050 (≈EUR 814)
from 1 January 2025. The same minimum wage applies to employees with a
seniority of over 15 years.

### Wealth per adult

In 2021, the median wealth per adult in Romania was estimated by Credit Suisse
at USD **20,389**. Average wealth per adult was USD 42,351.

35% of the 15.1 million Romanian adults had a wealth of less than USD 10,000.
This is an improvement from 40% in 2018.

## Tourism

Romania is a popular tourist destination, with more than 15.7 million domestic
and foreign tourists in 2018.

Romania's tourism took a great hit during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, with a
drop of as much as 68.7% of foreign visitors in 2020, but it's beginning to
recover in 2022.

Romania has cities of great cultural interest (Sibiu, Bucharest, Constanța,
Brașov, Iași, Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca or Alba Iulia), beaches and seaside
resorts, ski resorts, and well-preserved rural regions appreciated for their
beauty and tranquillity. Romania is the destination of many religious
pilgrimages,[_citation needed_] hosting several thousands visitors each year.

## Currency

One new leu bank-note

The **leu** (pronounced [ˈlew]), plural: **lei** ([ˈlej]); (ISO 4217 code RON;
numeric code 946), "leo" (lion) in English is the currency of Romania. It is
subdivided into 100 _bani_ (singular: _ban_). On 1 July 2005, Romania
underwent a currency reform, switching from the previous leu (ROL) to a new
leu (RON). 1 RON is equal to 10,000 ROL. Romania joined the European Union on
1 January 2007 and initially hoped to adopt the euro in 2014, but with the
deepening of the Euro crisis and with its own problems, such as a low
workforce productivity, postponed its adoption plans indefinitely.

As of April 2025, 1 RON is worth about 0.2006 EUR and US$0.2278. Romania is
expected to adopt the euro in 2026.

### Fulfillment of the Maastricht criteria

Romania, as a member state of the European Union, is required to adopt the
common European currency, the Euro. For this reason Romania must fulfil the
five Maastricht criteria, of which it met none as of June 2020.

  

Convergence criteria Assessment month  | Country  | HICP inflation rate | Excessive deficit procedure | Exchange rate  | Long-term interest rate | Compatibility of legislation

6.6%  | 48.8%   
  
**Criterion fulfilled**

**Criterion potentially fulfilled** : If the budget deficit exceeds the 3%
limit, but is "close" to this value (the European Commission has deemed 3.5%
to be close by in the past), then the criteria can still potentially be
fulfilled if either the deficits in the previous two years are significantly
declining towards the 3% limit, or if the excessive deficit is the result of
exceptional circumstances which are temporary in nature (i.e. one-off
expenditures triggered by a significant economic downturn, or by the
implementation of economic reforms that are expected to deliver a significant
positive impact on the government's future fiscal budgets). However, even if
such "special circumstances" are found to exist, additional criteria must also
be met to comply with the fiscal budget criterion. Additionally, if the debt-
to-GDP ratio exceeds 60% but is "sufficiently diminishing and approaching the
reference value at a satisfactory pace" it can be deemed to be in compliance.

**Criterion not fulfilled**

Notes

  1. **^** The rate of increase of the 12-month average HICP over the prior 12-month average must be no more than 1.5% larger than the unweighted arithmetic average of the similar HICP inflation rates in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation. If any of these 3 states have a HICP rate significantly below the similarly averaged HICP rate for the eurozone (which according to ECB practice means more than 2% below), and if this low HICP rate has been primarily caused by exceptional circumstances (i.e. severe wage cuts or a strong recession), then such a state is not included in the calculation of the reference value and is replaced by the EU state with the fourth lowest HICP rate.
  2. **^** The arithmetic average of the annual yield of 10-year government bonds as of the end of the past 12 months must be no more than 2.0% larger than the unweighted arithmetic average of the bond yields in the 3 EU member states with the lowest HICP inflation. If any of these states have bond yields which are significantly larger than the similarly averaged yield for the eurozone (which according to previous ECB reports means more than 2% above) and at the same time does not have complete funding access to financial markets (which is the case for as long as a government receives bailout funds), then such a state is not to be included in the calculation of the reference value.
  3. **^** The change in the annual average exchange rate against the euro.
  4. **^** Reference values from the Convergence Report of June 2024.
  5. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands were the reference states.
  6. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ The maximum allowed change in rate is ± 2.25% for Denmark.
  7. **^** Reference values from the Convergence Report of June 2025.

## Natural resources

Romania is an oil and gas producer. The pipeline network in Romania included
2,427 km for crude oil, 3,850 km for petroleum products, and 3,508 km for
natural gas in 2006. Several major new pipelines are planned, especially the
Nabucco Pipeline for Caspian oilfields, the longest one in the world. Romania
could cash in four billion dollars from the Constanta-Trieste pipeline.

Romania has considerable[_vague_] natural resources for a country of its size,
including coal, iron ore, copper, chromium, uranium, antimony, mercury, gold,
barite, borate, celestine (strontium), emery, feldspar, limestone, magnesite,
marble, perlite, pumice, pyrites (sulfur), clay, arable land and hydropower.

Energy needs are also met by importing bituminous and anthracite coal and
crude petroleum. In 2019 over 21 million metric tonnes of coal, an estimated
1300 tonnes of zinc, 460,000 tonnes of alumina and 3.4 million tonnes of crude
steel were mined. Lesser amounts of copper, lead, gold, silver and kaolin were
also mined.

### Energy

The Iron Gate I Hydro Power Plant, a joint venture between Romania and Serbia

The energy sector is dominated by state-owned companies such as
Termoelectrica, Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica. Fossil fuels are the
country's primary source of energy, followed by hydroelectric power.

#### Nuclear energy in Romania

Due to dependency on oil and gas imports from Russia, the country has placed
an increasingly heavy emphasis on nuclear energy since the 1980s. The
Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant is the only one of its kind in Romania, although
there are plans to build a second one in Transylvania, possibly after 2020.

For domestic heating and cooking 48% of rural and small-town households use
directly burned solid fuel (almost exclusively domestically produced wood) as
the main energy source.

Wind power had an installed capacity of 76 MW in 2008, and 3028 MW in 2016.
The country has the largest wind power potential in Southeast Europe, with
Dobruja listed as the second-best place in Europe to construct wind farms. As
a result, there are currently[_when?_] investor connection requests for over
12,000 MW. There are also plans to build a number of solar power stations,
such as the Covaci Solar Park, which will be one of the largest in the world.

## Physical infrastructure

A1 motorway near Orăștie

The volume of traffic in Romania, especially goods transportation, has
increased in recent years due to its strategic location in South-East Europe.
In the past few decades, much of the freight traffic shifted from rail to
road. A further strong increase of traffic is expected in the future.

As of December 2023, 1,065.9 km (662.3 mi) of motorways are in use with a
small portion of Lugoj-Deva (between Margina and Holdea) to be finished while
Sibiu-Pitești is still tendering. The railway network, which was significantly
expanded during the Communist years, is the fourth largest in Europe.

Bucharest is the only city in Romania which has an underground railway system,
comprising both the Bucharest Metro and the light rail system managed by Regia
Autonomă de Transport București. Although construction was planned to begin in
1941, due to geo-political factors, the Bucharest Metro was only opened in
1979. Now it is one of the most accessed systems of the Bucharest public
transport network with an average ridership of 800,000 passengers during the
workweek. In total, the network is 71 km long and has 53 stations.

## Sectors of the economy

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Romania
is Services with 351,621 companies followed by Retail Trade with 239,404
companies.

### Gas and natural resources

Romania has become a natural gas exporter. Romanian Scientist, Lazar Edeleanu,
had managed, for the first time in the world, to refine oil based products
with sulphur dioxide, in other words separation from the oil of some
hydrocarbon groups, without their chemical alteration.

### Agriculture

Agriculture employs about 26% of the population (one of the highest rates in
Europe) and contributes about 4.3% of GDP. The Bărăgan is characterized by
large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork, poultry, and apple production are
concentrated in the western region.

Beef production is located in central Romania, while the production of fruits,
vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern Romania. Romania is a
large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its
forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the reforms and the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have
resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.

#### Fishing

Fishing is an economic mainstay in parts of eastern Romania and along the
Black Sea coast, with important fish markets in places such as Constanta,
Galați and Tulcea. Fish such as European anchovy, sprat, pontic shad, mullet,
goby, whiting, garfish, Black-Sea Turbot or horse mackerel are landed at ports
such as Constanta.

There has been a large scale decrease in employment in the fishing industry
within Romania due to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, which places
restrictions on the total tonnage of catch that can be landed, caused by
overfishing in the Black Sea. Along with the decline of sea-fishing,
commercial fish farms – especially in salmon, have increased in prominence in
the rivers and lochs of the east of Romania. Inland waters are rich in fresh
water fish such as salmon, trout, and in particular, carp which traditionally
has been the most popular fish, including its eggs (_icre_), fresh or canned.

### Industry

#### Car industry

2018 Dacia Duster

#### IT and other Industry

Romania has been successful in developing its industrial sector in recent
years. Industry and construction accounted for 32% of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2003, a comparatively large share even without taking into account
related services. The sector employed 26.4% of the workforce. Romania excels
in the production of automobiles, machine tools, and chemicals. In 2013, some
410,997 automobiles were produced in Romania, up from 78,165 in 2000. As of
2018, the turnover generated by Romania's automobile industry was estimated at
28 billion Euros, with 230,000 Romanians employed in the sector.

In 2004 Romania enjoyed one of the largest world market share in machine tools
(5.3%). Romanian-based companies such as Dacia, Petrom, Rompetrol,
Bitdefender, Romstal and Mobexpert have expanded operations throughout the
region. However, small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms form the bulk of
Romania's industrial sector.

Industrial output growth was 6.9% year-on-year in December 2009, making it the
highest in the EU-27 zone which averaged −1.9%.

Romania has the third-highest percentage of women working in information and
communications technologies (ICT) in Europe. 29% of their workforce is made up
of women.

### Services

In 2003 the service sector constituted 55% of gross domestic product (GDP),
and employed 51.3% of the workforce. The subcomponents of services are
financial, renting, and business activities (20.5%); trade, hotels and
restaurants, and transport (18%); and other service activities (21.7%). The
service sector in Romania has expanded in recent years, employing some 47% of
Romanians and accounting for slightly more than half of GDP.

The largest employer is the retail sector, employing almost 12% of Romanians.
The retail industry is mainly concentrated in a relatively small number of
chain stores clustered together in shopping malls. In recent years the rise of
big-box stores, such as Cora (hypermarket) (of France) and Carrefour (a French
subsidiary), have led to fewer workers in this sector and a migration of
retail jobs to the suburbs.

## Biotechnology industry

Romania is aggressively promoting and developing its biotechnology industry.
Hundred of millions of dollars were invested into the sector to build up
infrastructure, fund research and development and to recruit top international
scientists to Romania. Romania features one of the world's newest competitive
bio-industries, in key areas as pharmacogenomics, protein engineering, glyco-
engineering, tissue engineering, bio-informatics, genome medicine and
preventive medicine. Romania is devoting substantial resources to developing
universities and R&D facilities, increasing bioventure startups, growing bio-
clusters (communities of biotechnology companies and institutions) and
developing human resources, all with the goal of making it one of the world's
most advanced biotechnology regions.[_citation needed_]

## Regional variation

The strength of the Romanian economy varies from region to region. PPP, and
GDP per capita is the highest in Bucharest. The following table shows the
highest GDP per capita of the other 4 counties, with data supplied by CNP.
[_citation needed_]

Rank  | County  | GDP per capita (2022)  
(EUR)  
---|---|---  
1  | Bucharest | 57,189   
2  | Timiș | 29,996   
3  | Constanța | 27,608   
4  | Cluj | 25,682   
5  | Brașov | 23,908   
6  | Arad | 21,000   
  
The highest GDP per capita is found in Bucharest and surrounding Ilfov County.
Values well above the national average are found in Timiș, Argeș, Brașov,
Cluj, Constanța, Arad, Sibiu and Prahova. Values well below the national
average are found in: Vaslui, Botoșani, Călărași, Neamț, Vrancea, Suceava,
Giurgiu, Mehedinți, Olt and Teleorman.

## Foreign trade

In 2017, Romania's largest trading partner was Germany, followed by Italy.
Romania's main imports and exports are electrical machinery, motor vehicles &
parts and industrial machinery. While Romania imports substantial quantities
of grain, it is largely self-sufficient in other agricultural products and
food stuffs, due to the fact that food must be regulated for sale in the
Romania retail market, and hence imports almost no food products from other
countries.

Romania imported in 2006 food products of 2.4 billion euros, up almost 20%
versus 2005, when the imports were worth slightly more than 2 billion euros.
The EU is Romania's main partner in the trade with agri-food products. The
exports to this destination represent 64%, and the imports from the EU
countries represent 54%. Other important partners are the CEFTA countries,
Turkey, Republic of Moldova and the USA. Despite a decline of the arms
industry in the post-communist era, Romania is a significant exporter of
military equipment, accounting for 3–4% of the world total in 2007. EU members
are represented by a single official at the World Trade Organization.

During the first trimester of 2010, Romanian exports increased by 21%, one of
the largest rates in the European Union. The trade deficit stood at roughly 2
billion EUR, the eighth largest in the EU. The annual trade deficit has
widened every year since 2014, standing at about EUR 18.77B in 2020.
