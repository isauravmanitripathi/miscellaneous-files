Real GPD per capita development in Costa Rica

The **economy ofCosta Rica** has been very stable for some years now, with
continuing growth in the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and moderate inflation,
though with a high unemployment rate: 11.49% in 2019. Costa Rica's economy
emerged from recession in 1997 and has shown strong aggregate growth since
then. The estimated GDP for 2023 is US$90 billion, up significantly from the
US$52.6 billion in 2015 while the estimated 2024 per capita (purchasing power
parity) is US$28,558.

Inflation remained around 4% to 5% per annum for several years up to 2015 but
then dropped to 0.7% in 2016; it was expected to rise to a still moderate 2.8%
by the end of 2017 In 2017, Costa Rica had the highest standards of living in
Central America in spite of the high poverty level. The poverty level dropped
by 1.2% in 2017 to 20.5%, thanks to reducing inflation and benefits offered by
the government. The estimated unemployment level in 2017 was 8.1%, roughly the
same as in 2016.

The country has evolved from an economy that once depended solely on
agriculture, to one that is more diverse, based on tourism, electronics and
medical components exports, medical manufacturing and IT services. Corporate
services for foreign companies employ some 3% of the workforce. Of the GDP,
5.5% is generated by agriculture, 18.6% by industry and 75.9% by services
(2016). Agriculture employs 12.9% of the labor force, industry 18.57%,
services 69.02% (2016) Many foreign companies operate in the various Free-
trade zones. In 2015, exports totalled US$12.6 billion while imports totalled
US$15 billion for a trade deficit of US$2.39 billion.

The growing debt and budget deficit are the country's primary concerns. By
August 2017, Costa Rica was having difficulty paying its obligations and the
President promised dramatic changes to handle the "liquidity crisis". Other
challenges face Costa Rica in its attempts to increase the economy by foreign
investment. They include a poor infrastructure and a need to improve public
sector efficiency.

## Public debt and deficit

One of the country's major concerns is the level of the public debt,
especially as a percentage of the GDP (Gross Domestic Product), increasing
from 29.8% in 2011 to 40.8% in 2015 and to 45% in 2016. The total debt in 2015
was $22.648 billion, up by nearly $3 billion from 2014. On a per capita basis,
the debt was $4,711 per person. Costa Rica had a formal line of credit with
the World Bank valued at US$947 million in April 2014, of which US$645 million
had been accessed and US$600 million remained outstanding.

In a June 2017 report, the International Monetary Fund stated that annual
growth was just over 4% with moderate inflation. The report added that
"financial system appears sound, and credit growth continues to be consistent
with healthy financial deepening and macroeconomic trends. The agency noted
that the fiscal deficit remains high and public debt continues to rise rapidly
despite the authorities’ deepened consolidation efforts in 2016. Recent
advances in fiscal consolidation have been partly reversed and political
consensus on a comprehensive fiscal package remains elusive".

The IMF also expressed concern about increasing deficits, public debt and the
heavy dollarization of bank assets and liabilities, warning that in tighter-
than-expected global financial conditions these aspects would "seriously
undermine investor confidence". The group also recommended taking steps to
reduce pension benefits and increase the amount of contribution by the public
and increasing the cost effectiveness of the education system.

The country's credit rating was reduced by Moody's Investors Service in early
2017 to Ba2 from Ba1, with a negative outlook on the rating. The agency
particularly cited the "rising government debt burden and persistently high
fiscal deficit, which was 5.2% of GDP in 2016". Moody's was also concerned
about the "lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the
fiscal deficit [which] will result in further pressure on the government's
debt ratios". In late July 2017, the Central Bank estimated the budget deficit
at 6.1 percent of the country's GDP. A 2017 study by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt
must be a very high priority for the government. Other fiscal reforms were
also recommended to moderate the budget deficit.

In 2014, President Solís presented a budget with an increase in spending of
19% for 2015, an increase of 0.5% for 2016 and an increase of 12% for 2017.
When the 2017 budget was finally proposed, it totaled US$15.9 billion. Debt
payments account for one-third of that amount. Of greater concern is the fact
that a full 46% of the budget will require financing, a step that will
increase the debt owed to foreign entities. In late July 2017, the Central
Bank estimated the budget deficit at 6.1 percent of the country's GDP.

### Liquidity crisis

In early August 2017, President Luis Guillermo Solís admitted that the country
was facing a "liquidity crisis", an inability to pay all of its obligations
and to guarantee the essential services. To address this issue, he promised
that a higher VAT and higher income tax rates were being considered by his
government. Such steps are essential, Solís told the nation. "Despite all the
public calls and efforts we have made since the start of my administration to
contain spending and increase revenues, there is still a gap that we must
close with fresh resources," he said. The crisis was occurring in spite of the
growth, low inflation and continued moderate interest rates, Solís concluded.

Solís explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt
first, then salaries, and then pensions. The subsequent priorities include
transfers to institutions "according to their social urgency." All other
payments will be made only if funds are available.

## Other challenges

A 2016 report by the U.S. government report identifies other challenges facing
Costa Rica as it works to expand its economy by working with potential foreign
investors:

  * The ports, roads, water systems would benefit from major upgrading. Attempts by China to invest in upgrading such aspects were "stalled by bureaucratic and legal concerns".
  * The bureaucracy is "often slow and cumbersome".
  * The country needs even more workers who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French. It would also benefit from more graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs.
  * Some sectors are controlled by a state monopoly which excludes competition but in other respects, "Costa Rican laws, regulations and practices are generally transparent and foster competition".
  * The country has been slow in completing environmental impact assessments which have caused delays in projects being completed.
  * Product registration is a slow process, although this may improve with digitization.
  * In spite of government attempts at improving the enforcement of intellectual property laws, this aspect remains a concern.

## Natural resources

Costa Rica's rainfall, and its location in the Central American isthmus, which
provides easy access to North and South American markets and direct ocean
access to the European and Asian Continents. Costa Rica has two seasons, both
of which have their own agricultural resources: the tropical wet and dry
seasons. One-fourth of Costa Rica's land is dedicated to national forests,
often adjoining beaches, which has made the country a popular destination for
affluent retirees and ecotourists.

A full 10.27% of the country is protected as national parks while an
additional 17% is set aside for reserves, wildlife refuges and protected
zones. Costa Rica has over 50 wildlife refuges, 32 major national parks, more
than 12 forest reserves and a few biological reserves.

Because of ocean access, 23.7% of Costa Rica's people fish and trade their
catches to fish companies; this is viewed as "small scale artisanal coastal"
fishing and is most common in the Gulf of Nicoya. Costa Rica also charges
licensing fees for commercial fishing fleets that are taking tuna, sardines,
banga mary, mahi-mahi, red tilapia, shrimp, red snapper, other snappers,
shark, marlin and sailfish. In mid 2017, the country was planning to ban
large-scale commercial fishing off the southern Pacific Coast in an area
nearly a million acres in size. The bill in congress was intended to "protect
the extraordinary marine and coastal resources" from "indiscriminate and
unsustainable commercial fishing."

Sport fishing in Costa Rica is an important part of the tourism industry;
species include marlin, sailfish, dorado, tarpon, snook, rooster fish, wahoo,
tuna, mackerel, snapper and rainbow bass.

In terms of the 2012 Environmental Performance Index ranking, Costa Rica is
5th in the world, and first among the Americas. The World Economic Forum's
2017 Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Costa Rica as third of 136
countries based on natural resources, the number of World Heritage natural
sites, protected areas and species as well as eco tourism.

## Tourism

Ecotourism is key in Costa Rica's tourism industry. Shown Savegre River,
Talamanca.

With a $1.92-billion-a-year tourism industry, Costa Rica was the most visited
nation in the Central American region, with 2.42 million foreign visitors in
2013. By 2016, 2.6 million tourists visited Costa Rica. The Tourism Board
estimates that this sector's spending in the country represented over US$3.4
billion, or about 5.8% of the GDP. The World Travel & Tourism Council's
estimates indicate a direct contribution to the 2016 GDP of 5.1% and 110,000
direct jobs in Costa Rica; the total number of jobs indirectly supported by
tourism was 271,000.

Ecotourism is extremely popular with the many tourists visiting the extensive
national parks and protected areas around the country. Costa Rica was a
pioneer in this type of tourism and the country is recognized as one of the
few with real ecotourism. Other important market segments are adventure, sun
and beaches. Most of the tourists come from the U.S. and Canada (46%), and the
EU (16%), the prime market travelers in the world, which translates into a
relatively high expenditure per tourist of $1000 per trip.

In the 2008 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), Costa Rica
reached the 44th place in the world ranking, being the first among Latin
American countries, and second if the Caribbean is included. Just considering
the subindex measuring human, cultural, and natural resources, Costa Rica
ranks in the 24th place at a worldwide level, and 7th when considering just
the natural resources criteria. The TTCI report also notes Costa Rica's main
weaknesses, ground transport infrastructure (ranked 113th), and safety and
security (ranked 128th).

The online travel magazine Travelzoo rated Costa Rica as one of five “Wow Deal
Destinations for 2012”. The magazine Travel Weekly named Costa Rica the best
destination in Central and South America in 2011. In 2017, the country was
nominated in the following categories in the World Travel Awards: Mexico &
Central America's Leading Beach Destination, Mexico & Central America's
Leading Destination and Mexico & Central America's Leading Tourist Board.

## Agriculture

Costa Rica's economy was historically based on agriculture, and this has had a
large cultural impact through the years. Costa Rica's main cash crop,
historically and up to modern times, was Bananas. The coffee crop had been a
major export, but decreased in value to the point where it added only 2.5% to
the 2013 exports of the country.

Agriculture also plays an important part in the country's gross domestic
product (GDP). It makes up about 6.5% of Costa Rica’s GDP, and employs 12.9%
of the labor force (2016). By comparison, industry employs 18.57% of the labor
force, and the service sector 69.02%.

Depending on location and altitude, many regions differ in agricultural crops
and techniques. The main agricultural exports from the country include:
bananas, pineapples (the second highest export, with over 50% share of the
world market), other tropical fruits, coffee (much of it grown in the Valle
Central or Meseta Central), sugar, rice, palm oil, vegetables, tropical
fruits, ornamental plants, maize, and potatoes.

Livestock activity consists of cattle, pigs and horses, as well as poultry.
Meat and dairy produce are leading exports according to one source, but both
were not in the top 10 categories of 2013.

The combined export value of forest products and textiles in 2013 did not
exceed that of either chemical products or plastics.

## Mining

Mining in Costa Rica contributes a small amount to the economy. In 2018 5.2
tons of gold were produced.

## Exports, jobs, and energy

Intel microprocessor facility in Costa Rica

Mere decades ago, Costa Rica was known principally as a producer of bananas
and coffee. Even though bananas, pineapple, sugar, coffee, lumber, wood
products and beef are still important exports, in recent times medical
instruments, electronics, pharmaceuticals, financial outsourcing, software
development, and ecotourism are now the prime exports. High levels of
education and fluency in English among its residents make the country an
attractive investing location.

In 2015 the following were the major export products (US$): medical
instruments ($2 billion), bananas ($1.24B), tropical fruits ($1.22B),
integrated circuits ($841 million) and orthopedic appliances ($555M). The
total exports in 2015 were US$12.6 billion, down from $18.9B in 2010; bananas
and medical instruments were the two largest sectors. Total imports in 2015
were $15B, up from $13.8B in 2010; this resulted in a trade deficit.

Over the years, Costa Rica successfully attracted important investments by
such companies as Intel Corporation, Procter & Gamble, Abbott Laboratories and
Baxter Healthcare. Manufacturing and industry's contribution to GDP overtook
agriculture over the course of the 1990s, led by foreign investment in Costa
Rica's Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where companies benefit from investment and tax
incentives. Companies in such zones must export at least 50% of their
services. Well over half of that type of investment has come from the U.S.
According to the government, the zones supported over 82 thousand direct jobs
and 43 thousand indirect jobs in 2015; direct employment grew 5% over 2014.
The average wages in the FTZ increased by 7% and were 1.8 times greater than
the average for private enterprise work in the rest of the country. Companies
with facilities in the America Free Zone in Heredia, for example, include
Dell, HP, Bayer, Bosch, DHL, IBM and Okay Industries.

In 2006 Intel's microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa
Rican exports and 4.9% of the country's GDP. In 2014, Intel announced it would
end manufacturing in Costa Rica and lay off 1,500 staff but agreed to maintain
at least 1,200 employees. The facility continued as a test and design center
with approximately 1,600 remaining staff. In 2017, Intel had 2000 employees in
the country, and was operating a facility which assembles, tests and
distributes processors and a Global Innovation Center, both in Heredia.

The fastest growing aspect of the economy is the provision of corporate
services for foreign companies which in 2016 employed approximately 54,000
people in a country with a workforce under 342,000; that was up from 52,400
the previous year. For example, Amazon.com employs some 5,000 people. Many
work in the free-trade areas such as Zona Franca America and earn roughly
double the national average for service work. This sector generated US$4.6
billion in 2016, nearly as much as tourism.

In 2013, the total FDI stock in Costa Rica amounted to about 40 percent of
GDP, of which investments from the United States accounted for 64 percent,
followed by the United Kingdom and Spain with 6 percent each. Costa Rica's
outward foreign direct investment stock is small, at about 3 percent of GDP as
of 2011, and mainly concentrated in Central America (about 57 percent of the
total outward direct investment stock).

Tourism is an important part of the economy, with the number of visitors
increasing from 780,000 in 1996, to 1 million in 1999, and to 2.089 million
foreign visitors in 2008, allowing the country to earn $2.144-billion in that
year. By 2016, 2.6 million tourists visited Costa Rica, spending roughly
US$3.4 billion. Tourism directly supported 110,000 jobs and indirectly
supported 271,000 in 2016.

Costa Rica has not discovered sources of fossil fuels—apart from minor coal
deposits—but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the
construction of a dozen hydroelectric power plants, making it self-sufficient
in all energy needs, except for refined petroleum. In 2017, Costa Rica was
considering the export of electricity to neighbouring countries. Mild climate
and trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in
the highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.
Renewable energy in Costa Rica is the norm. In 2016, 98.1 per cent of the
country's electricity came from green sources: hydro generating stations,
geothermal plants, wind turbines, solar panels and biomass plants.

## Infrastructure

Costa Rica's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new
investment. The country has an extensive road system of more than 30,000
kilometers, although much of it is in disrepair; this also applies to ports,
railways and water delivery systems. According to a 2016 U.S. government
report, investment from China which attempted to improve the infrastructure
found the "projects stalled by bureaucratic and legal concerns".

Most parts of the country are accessible by road. The main highland cities in
the country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and by the Pan American Highway with Nicaragua and
Panama, the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's
ports are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient
capacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't
function for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it
for city transportation. An August 2016 OECD report provided this summary:
"The road network is extensive but of poor quality, railways are in disrepair
and only slowly being reactivated after having been shut down in the 1990s,
seaports quality and capacity are deficient. Internal transportation overly
relies on private road vehicles as the public transport system, especially
railways, is inadequate."

In a June 2017 interview, President Luis Guillermo Solís said that private
sector investment would be required to solve the problems. "Of course Costa
Rica’s infrastructure deficit is a challenge that outlasts any one government
and I hope that we have created the foundations for future administrations to
continue building. I have just enacted a law to facilitate Public Private
Partnerships, which are the ideal way to develop projects that are too large
for the government to undertake. For example the new airport that we are
building to serve the capital city will cost $2 billion, so it will need
private-sector involvement. There is also the potential for a ‘dry canal’
linking sea ports on our Atlantic and Caribbean Coasts that could need up to
$16 billion of investment."

The government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management
into the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies
of the state. ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad) has the monopoly
on telecommunications, internet and electricity services. Some limited
competition is allowed. In 2011, two new private companies began offering
cellular phone service and others offer voice communication over internet
connections (VOIP) for overseas calls.

According to transparency.org, Costa Rica had a reputation as one of the most
stable, prosperous, and among the least corrupt in Latin America in 2007.
However, in fall 2004, three former Costa Rican presidents, José María
Figueres, Miguel Angel Rodríguez, and Rafael Angel Calderon, were investigated
on corruption charges related to the issuance of government contracts. After
extensive legal proceedings Calderon and Rodriguez were sentenced; however,
the inquiry on Figueres was dismissed and he was not charged.

More recently, Costa Rica reached 40th place in 2015, with a score of 55 on
the Perception of Corruption scale; this is better than the global average.
Countries with the lowest perceived corruption rated 90 on the scale. In late
May 2017, the country Costa Rica applied to become a member of the OECD Anti-
Bribery Convention, to be effective in July 2017.

## Foreign trade

FTA Costa Rica has approved / is negotiating

Costa Rica has sought to widen its economic and trade ties, both within and
outside the region. Costa Rica signed a bilateral trade agreement with Mexico
in 1994, which was later amended to cover a wider range of products. Costa
Rica joined other Central American countries, plus the Dominican Republic, in
establishing a Trade and Investment Council with the United States in March
1998, which later became the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade
Agreement. Costa Rica has bilateral free trade agreements with the following
countries and blocs which took effect on (see date):

  * Canada (November 1, 2002)
  * Caribbean Community (CARICOM)¨ (November 15, 2002)
  * Chile (February 15, 2002)
  * China (August 1, 2011).
  * Colombia (September 2016)
  * Dominican Republic (March 7, 2002)
  * El Salvador Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
  * European Free Trade Association (2013)
  * European Union (October 1, 2013)
  * Guatemala Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
  * Honduras Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
  * Mexico (January 1, 1995)
  * Nicaragua Customs union, (1963, re-launched on October 29, 1993)
  * Panama (July 31, 1973, renegotiated and expanded for January 1, 2009)
  * Peru (June 1, 2013)
  * United States (January 1, 2009, CAFTA-DR)
  * Singapore (April 6, 2010)
  * South Korea (March 18, 2019)

There are no significant trade barriers that would affect imports and the
country has been lowering its tariffs in accordance with other Central
American countries. Costa Rica also is a member of the Cairns Group, an
organization of agricultural exporting countries that are seeking access to
more markets to increase the exports of agricultural products. Opponents of
free agricultural trade have sometimes attempted to block imports of products
already grown in Costa Rica, including rice, potatoes, and onions. By 2015,
Costa Rica's agricultural exports totalled US$2.7 billion.

In 2015, the top export destinations for all types of products were the United
States (US$4.29 billion), Guatemala ($587 million), the Netherlands ($537
million), Panama ($535 million) and Nicaragua ($496 million). The top import
origins were the United States ($6.06 billion), China ($1.92 billion), Mexico
($1.14 billion), Japan ($410 million) and Guatemala ($409 million). The most
significant products imported were Refined Petroleum (8.41% of the total
imports) and Automobiles (4.68%). Total imports in 2015 were US$15 billion,
somewhat higher than the total exports of a US$12.6 billion, for a negative
trade balance of US$2.39 billion.

## Foreign Direct Investment

The Costa Rican government has and is “actively courting FDI” in order to help
develop its economy. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a form of investment
that promotes development in key industries such as manufacturing, medicine,
and tourism. FDI's influence provides a very lucrative opportunity for foreign
investors which is what continues to attract such large investments year over
year. Over time FDI inflows in Costa Rica have increased, Net FDI inflow
averaged forty four million dollars per year from 1970 to 1979 and just ten
years later this value rose to four hundred and sixteen million dollars. The
2022 data show that Costa Rica received $3 billion in FDI which accounted for
4.45% of their total GDP.

Growth in FDI is linked to rising tourist arrivals with the numbers rising
from 2.1 million in 2011 to 3.1 million in 2019. Facilitation of FDI growth is
seen as an essential role of the Costa Rican government. Throughout 2019 and
2022, the government of Costa Rica was able to court investment for a total of
16 new FDI projects with one of the more notable projects being a luxury hotel
named One and Only Papagayo.
