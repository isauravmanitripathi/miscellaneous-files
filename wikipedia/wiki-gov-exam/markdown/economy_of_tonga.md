Tonga's economy is characterized by a large nonmonetary sector and a heavy
dependence on remittances from the half of the country's population that lives
abroad, chiefly in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Much of the
monetary sector of the economy is dominated, if not owned, by the royal family
and nobles. This is particularly true of the telecommunications and satellite
services. Much of small business, particularly retailing on Tongatapu, is now
dominated by recent Chinese immigrants who arrived under a cash-for-passports
scheme that ended in 1998.

The manufacturing sector consists of handicrafts and a few other very
smallscale industries, all of which contribute only about 3% of GDP.
Commercial business activities also are inconspicuous and, to a large extent,
are dominated by the same large trading companies found throughout the South
Pacific. In September 1974, the country's first commercial trading bank, the
Bank of Tonga, opened.

Rural Tongans rely on plantation and subsistence agriculture. Coconuts,
vanilla beans, and bananas are the major cash crops. The processing of
coconuts into copra and desiccated coconut is the only significant industry.
Pigs and poultry are the major types of livestock. Horses are kept for draft
purposes, primarily by farmers working their api. More cattle are being
raised, and beef imports are declining.

Tonga's development plans emphasize a growing private sector, upgrading
agricultural productivity, revitalizing the squash and vanilla bean
industries, developing tourism, and improving the island's communications and
transportation systems. A small but growing construction sector is developing
in response to the inflow of aid monies and remittances from Tongans abroad.
The copra industry is plagued by world prices that have been depressed for
years.

Efforts are being made to discover ways to diversify. One hope is seen in
fisheries; tests have shown that sufficient skipjack tuna pass through Tongan
waters to support a fishing industry. Another potential development activity
is exploitation of forests, which cover 35% of the kingdom's land area but are
decreasing as land is cleared. Coconut trees past their prime bearing years
also provide a potential source of lumber.

The tourist industry is relatively undeveloped; however, the government
recognizes that tourism can play a major role in economic development, and
efforts are being made to increase this source of revenue. Cruise ships often
stop in Nukuʻalofa and Vava'u.

According to the CIA World Factbook,

In 2021 the Tongan government committed to a target of 70% renewable energy by
2030.

In July 2012 Tonga Power opened Tonga's first solar photovoltaic generator,
the 1.32 MW Maama Mai Solar Farm on Tongatapu. This was followed by a 6MW
solar farm spread across three sites on Tongatapu. A pair of 13 MW / 24 MWh
grid batteries began operating on the main island in 2022. An Outer Islands
Renewable Energy Project is installing solar / battery systems on nine smaller
islands, and upgrading the electrical grids on 'Eua and Vava'u.
