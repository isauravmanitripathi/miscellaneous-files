Australia is a highly developed country with a mixed economy. As of 2023,
Australia was the 14th-largest national economy by nominal GDP (gross domestic
product), the 19th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP, and was the 21st-largest goods
exporter and 24th-largest goods importer. Australia took the record for the
longest run of uninterrupted GDP growth in the developed world with the March
2017 financial quarter. It was the 103rd quarter and the 26th year since the
country had a technical recession. As of June 2021, the country's GDP was
estimated at $1.98 trillion.

The Australian economy is dominated by its service sector, which in 2017
comprised 62.7% of the GDP and employed 78.8% of the labour force. At the
height of the mining boom in 2009–10, the total value-added of the mining
industry was 8.4% of GDP. Despite the recent decline in the mining sector, the
Australian economy has remained resilient and stable and did not experience a
recession from 1991 until 2020. Among OECD members, Australia has a highly
efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 25% of
GDP.

The Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney is the 16th-largest stock
exchange in the world in terms of domestic market capitalisation and has one
of the largest interest rate derivatives markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some of Australia's largest companies include Commonwealth Bank, BHP, CSL,
Westpac, NAB, ANZ, Fortescue, Wesfarmers, Macquarie Group, Woolworths Group,
Rio Tinto, Telstra, Woodside Energy and Transurban. The currency of Australia
and its territories is the Australian dollar, which it shares with several
Pacific nation states.

Australia's economy is strongly intertwined with the countries of East and
Southeast Asia, also known as ASEAN Plus Three (APT), accounting for about 64%
of exports in 2016. China in particular is Australia's main export and import
partner by a wide margin. Australia is a member of the APEC, G20, OECD and
WTO. The country has also entered into free trade agreements with ASEAN,
Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Japan,
Singapore, Thailand and the United States. The ANZCERTA agreement with New
Zealand has greatly increased integration with the economy of New Zealand.

## History

### 20th century

Australia's average GDP growth rate for the period 1901–2000 was 3.4%
annually. As opposed to many neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, the
process towards independence was relatively peaceful and thus did not have
significant negative impact on the economy and standard of living. Growth
peaked during the 1920s, followed by the 1950s and the 1980s. By contrast, the
late 1910s/early 1920s, the 1930s, the 1970s and early 1990s were marked by
financial crises.

#### Economic liberalisation

Zealand

From the early 1980s onwards, the Australian economy has undergone
intermittent economic liberalisation. In 1983, under prime minister Bob Hawke,
but mainly driven by treasurer Paul Keating, the Australian dollar was floated
and financial deregulation was undertaken.

#### Early 1990s recession

The early 1990s recession came swiftly after the Black Monday of October 1987,
as a result of a stock collapse of unprecedented size which caused the Dow
Jones Industrial Average to fall by 22.6%. This collapse, larger than the
stock market crash of 1929, was handled effectively by the global economy and
the stock market began to quickly recover. But in North America, the lumbering
savings and loans industry was facing decline, which eventually led to a
savings and loan crisis which compromised the well-being of millions of US
people. The following recession thus impacted the many countries closely
linked to the US, including Australia. Paul Keating, who was treasurer at the
time, famously referred to it as "the recession that Australia had to have."
During the recession, GDP fell by 1.7%, employment by 3.4% and the
unemployment rate rose to 10.8%. However, the recession did assist in reducing
long-term inflation rate expectations and Australia has maintained a low
inflation environment since the 1990s to the present day.

### Mining

Mining has contributed to Australia's high level of economic growth, from the
gold rush in the 1840s to the present day. The opportunities for large profits
in pastoralism and mining attracted considerable amounts of British capital,
while expansion was supported by enormous government outlays for transport,
communication, and urban infrastructures, which also depended heavily on
British finance. As the economy expanded, large-scale immigration satisfied
the growing demand for workers, especially after the end of convict
transportation to the eastern mainland in 1840. Australia's mining operations
secured continued economic growth and Western Australia itself benefited
strongly from mining iron ore and gold from the 1960s and 1970s which fuelled
the rise of suburbanisation and consumerism in Perth, the capital and most
populous city of Western Australia, as well as other regional centres.

### 2008 financial crisis

Australia is one of the three Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries that did not experience two consecutive negative
quarters of growth and one of the two that avoided negative year-end GDP
growth during the global recession. It was not affected by the crisis from
2008 to 2009 due to a number of factors such as government stimulus spending
of $11.8 billion, its proximity to the booming Chinese economy and the related
mining boom kept growth ticking over throughout the worst of the global
conditions. In fact, sources such as the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia
had predicted Australia was well positioned to weather the crisis with minimal
disruption, sustaining more than 2% GDP growth in 2009 (as many Western
nations went into recession). In the same year, the World Economic Forum
ranked Australia's banking system the fourth best in the world, while the
Australian dollar's 30% drop was seen as a boon for trade, shielding the
country from the crisis and helping to slow growth and consumption.
Australia's recession affected New Zealand's economy as Australia was New
Zealand's biggest export market. It is said that the term Great Recession as a
description of the post-2008 slump is not recognized by Australians
particularly those under 30 due to its mild, intangible impact on the
country's economy.

Some analysts had predicted the continuing decline of trade in 2009 could put
the economy into recession for the first time in 17 years. However, these
initial fears were proved largely unfounded as the Australian economy avoided
recession and the unemployment rate peaked at a much lower rate than had been
predicted. To help address the anticipated slowdown, the Australian government
also announced a stimulus package worth $27 billion to spur economic growth
while the Reserve Bank of Australia introduced a series of interest rate cuts.

While Australia's overall national economy grew, some non-mining states and
Australia's non-mining economy experienced a recession.

### 2010s

The World Bank expected Australia's GDP growth rate to be 3.2% in 2011 and
3.8% in 2012. The economy expanded by 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and
expanded by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2012. The growth rate was reported to
be 4.3% year-on-year.

The International Monetary Fund in April 2012 predicted that Australia would
be the best-performing major advanced economy in the world over the next two
years; the Australian Government Department of the Treasury anticipated
"forecast growth of 3.0% in 2012 and 3.5% in 2013", the National Australia
Bank in April 2012 cut its growth forecast for Australia to 2.9% from 3.2%.,
and JP Morgan in May 2012 cut its growth forecast to 2.7% in calendar 2012
from a previous forecast of 3.0%, also its forecast for growth in 2013 to 3.0%
from 3.3%. Deutsche Bank in August 2012, and Société Générale in October 2012,
warned that there is risk of recession in Australia in 2013.

### COVID-19 pandemic and recession

In September 2020, it was confirmed that due to the effects of lockdowns and
other government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian economy
had gone into recession for the first time in nearly thirty years, as the
country's GDP fell 7 per cent in the June 2020 quarter, following a 0.3 per
cent drop in the March quarter. It officially ended at the beginning of
December 2020.

### 2020s recovery

Following the 2020 recession, triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia
faced ongoing economic challenges under the Albanese Labor government, elected
in May 2022. Inflation surged, migration exceeded planned targets, and housing
affordability worsened, intensifying cost-of-living pressures. Inflation
peaked at 6.1% in May 2022 due to global supply chain issues and energy price
shocks, falling to 3.6% by March 2024 and 2.4% by December 2024, within the
Reserve Bank of Australia’s 2–3% target. However, core inflation remained at
3.5% in September 2024, with services inflation at 4.6%, indicating persistent
domestic pressures. Food prices rose 11.7% and gas 33.9% since 2022, outpacing
wage growth of 3.5% annually, while energy rebates capped electricity rises at
2.0% instead of 14.9%.

Labor’s migration policy adopted flexible targets, setting 190,000 places for
2023–2024 and 185,000 for 2024–2025, unlike the Coalition’s stricter caps,
with a four-year planning cycle from 2025–2026 based on recommendations.
However, net overseas migration hit 446,000 in 2023–2024, exceeding the
395,000 forecast by 51,000, after peaking at 528,000 in 2022–2023, far above
historical averages of 200,000–250,000. This “big Australia by stealth” was
linked to six quarters of negative per capita GDP growth, with GDP per head
down 0.3% in 2023–2024. The Productivity Commission highlighted strains on
housing and infrastructure from this surge.

Housing affordability declined, with approvals at 89,734 in 2024, below the
21,000 monthly needed for Labor’s 1.2 million homes target by 2029, causing a
12,000-dwelling shortfall in January 2025. According to the Housing Industry
Association (HIA), Australia constructed approximately 180,000 homes in the
previous year, falling well short of the 240,000 needed annually to meet
demand. This suggests a yearly shortfall of about 60,000 homes, highlighting
the severity of the housing crisis. Alan Kohler attributed a 30–40% cost rise
to taxes like GST and stamp duty, pricing a two-bedroom apartment at $1
million, unaffordable for median earners at $65,000. He noted barriers like
unionisation costs (up 40% since 2020) and NIMBYism, despite 59% of Sydney and
52% of Melbourne residents favouring denser housing. Rents rose 16.4% and
housing costs 12.9% since 2022, driven by migration.

Since 2019, Australian households experienced the sharpest decline in real
disposable income of any country in the OECD. According to a comparative
analysis of OECD data, real per capita household disposable income in
Australia fell by 8.0% over the two years leading up to March 2024. This
stands in marked contrast to the OECD average, which recorded a 2.6% increase
over the same period.

This performance positions Australia as an outlier among developed economies
and has prompted growing concern over the government’s management of the cost-
of-living crisis. While most OECD nations saw household incomes either
stabilise or rise, supported by targeted fiscal interventions and effective
inflation control, Australian households endured a sustained erosion of
purchasing power.

The fall in real incomes coincided with heightened inflationary pressures,
elevated interest rates, and a housing market that remains inaccessible for
many. The result has been a tangible reduction in living standards,
particularly for middle- and low-income earners, with stagnant wages failing
to keep pace with rising costs. Critics[_who?_] argue that the government’s
fiscal strategy has lacked the responsiveness seen in peer nations, leading to
Australia’s unique position as the OECD’s worst performer on this key economic
indicator.

## Overview

Australia's annual inflation rate (percentage change in CPI) since 1949.

Australia's per-capita GDP is higher than that of the UK, Canada, Germany and
France in terms of purchasing power parity. Per Capita GDP (PPP) Australia is
ranked 18th in the world (CIA World Factbook 2016). The country was ranked
fifth in the United Nations 2022 Human Development Index and sixth in _The
Economist_ worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In 2014, using constant
exchange rates, Australia's wealth had grown by 4.4% annually on average after
the 2008 financial crisis, compared with a 9.2% rate over 2000–2007.
Australia's sovereign credit rating is "AAA" for all three major rating
agencies, higher than the United States of America.

The emphasis on exporting commodities rather than manufactures underpinned a
significant increase in Australia's terms of trade during the rise in
commodity prices since 2000. However, due to a colonial heritage a lot of
companies operating in Australia are foreign-owned and as a result, Australia
has had persistent current account deficits for over 60 years despite periods
of positive net merchandise exports; given the net income outlay between
Australia and the rest of the world is always negative. The current account
deficit totalled AUD$44.5 billion in 2016 or 2.6% of GDP.

Inflation has typically been between 2 and 3% and the pre-GFC cash rate
typically ranged between 5 and 7%, however, partly in response to the end of
the mining boom the cash rate has recently been steadily falling, dropping
from 4.75% in October 2011 to 1.5% in Aug 2016, then to 1.25% in June 2019 and
1.0% in July 2019. The service sector of the economy, including tourism,
education and financial services, constitutes 69% of GDP. Australian National
University in Canberra also provides a probabilistic interest-rate-setting
project for the Australian economy, which is compiled by shadow board members
from the ANU academic staff.

Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
products, particularly wheat and wool, minerals such as iron ore and gold, and
energy in the forms of liquified natural gas and coal. Although agriculture
and natural resources constitute only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, they
contribute substantially to Australia's export composition. Australia's
largest export markets are Japan, China, South Korea, India and the United
States.

At the turn of the current century, Australia experienced a significant mining
boom. The mining sector's contribution to overall GDP grew from around 4.5% in
1993–94, to almost 8% in 2006–07. The services sector also grew considerably,
with property and business services in particular growing from 10% to 14.5% of
GDP over the same period, making it the largest single component of GDP (in
sectoral terms). This growth has largely been at the expense of the
manufacturing sector, which in 2006–07 accounted for around 12% of GDP. A
decade earlier, it was the largest sector in the economy, accounting for just
over 15% of GDP.

In 2018 Australia became the country with the largest median wealth per adult,
but slipped back to second highest after Switzerland in 2019. Australia's
total wealth was estimated to be AUD$10.9 trillion as of September 2019.

### Regional differences

Between 2010 and 2013, much of the economic growth in Australia was attributed
to areas of the country where mining- and resource-based industries and
services are mostly located. Western Australia and the Northern Territory are
the only states that have economic growth. During 2012 and 2013 Australian
Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales and
Victoria experienced recessions at various times. The Australian economy is
characterised as a "two-speed economy".[_clarification needed_] From June 2012
to March 2013 Victoria experienced a recession. In 2012 the Government of
Victoria cut 10% of all jobs in the public service. The period since has seen
these trends reversed with Western Australia and Northern Territory, who are
heavily dependent on mining, experience significant downturns in GDP while the
eastern states returned to growth, led by strong upturns in NSW and Victoria.

### Taxation

Quarterly taxation revenue ($millions) since 1959.

Taxation in Australia is levied at the federal, state, and local government
levels. The federal government raises revenue from personal income taxes and
business taxes. Other taxes include the goods and services tax (General
Service Tax), excise and customs duties. The federal government is the main
source of income for state governments. As a result of state dependence on
federal taxation revenue to meet decentralised expenditure responsibilities,
Australia is said to have a vertical fiscal imbalance.

Besides receipts of funds from the federal government, states and territories
have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes
commonly include payroll tax levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on
businesses that offer gambling services, land tax on people and businesses
that own land and most significantly, stamp duty on sales of land (in every
state) and other items (chattels in some states, unlisted shares in others,
and even sales of contracts in some states).

The states effectively lost the ability to raise income tax during the Second
World War. In 1942, Canberra invoked its Constitutional taxation power (s. 51
(ii)) and enacted the _Income Tax Act_ and three other statutes to levy a
uniform income tax across the country. These acts sought to raise the funds
necessary to meet burgeoning wartime expenses and reduce the unequal tax
burden between the states by replacing state income taxes with a centralised
tax system. The legislation could not expressly prohibit state income taxes
(s. 51(ii) does not curtail the power of states to levy taxes) but the federal
government's proposal made localised income tax extremely difficult
politically. The federal government offered instead compensatory grants
authorised by s. 96 of the Constitution for the loss of state income (_State
Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942_).

The states rejected Canberra's regime and challenged the legislation's
validity in the First Uniform Tax Case (_South Australia v Commonwealth_) of
1942. The High Court of Australia held that each of the statutes establishing
Commonwealth income tax was a valid use of the s. 51(ii) power, in which
Latham CJ noted that the system did not undermine essential state functions
and imposed only economic and political pressure upon them.

The Second Uniform Tax Case (_Victoria v Commonwealth_ (1957)) reaffirmed the
court's earlier decision and confirmed the power of the federal government's
power to make s. 96 grants conditionally (in this case, a grant made on the
condition that the recipient state does not levy income tax).

Since the Second Uniform Tax Case, a number of other political and legal
decisions have centralised fiscal power with the Commonwealth. In _Ha vs. New
South Wales_ (1997), the High Court found that the _Business Franchise
Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987_ (NSW) was invalid because it levied a customs
duty, a power exercisable only by the Commonwealth (s.90). This decision
effectively invalidated state taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and petrol.
Similarly, the imposition of a Commonwealth goods and services tax (GST) in
2000 transferred another revenue base to the Commonwealth.

Consequently, Australia has one of the most pronounced vertical fiscal
imbalances in the world: the states and territories collect just 18% of all
governmental revenues but are responsible for almost 50% of the spending
areas. Furthermore, the centralisation of revenue collection has allowed
Canberra to force state policy in areas well beyond the scope of its
constitutional powers, by using the grants power (s.96) to mandate the terms
on which the states spend money in areas over which it has no power (such as
spending on education, health and policing).

Local governments (called _councils_ in Australia) have their own taxes
(called rates) to enable them to provide services such as local road repairs,
local planning and building management, garbage collection, street cleaning,
park maintenance services, libraries, and museums. Councils also rely on state
and federal funding to provide infrastructure and services such as roads,
bridges, sporting facilities and buildings, aged care, maternal and child
health, and childcare.

In 2000, a goods and services tax (GST) was introduced, similar to the
European-style VAT.

## Employment

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate since 1978 The number of job
vacancies (thousands) since 1979

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) seasonally adjusted
estimates, the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1% in April 2025 while
the labour force participation rate increased 0.3 points to 67.1%. The
participation rate for 15- to 24-year-olds remained steady at 70.0% while the
unemployment rate for this group decreased by 0.1 points to 8.8%. According to
the ABS, in April 2025, the underemployment rate increased by 0.1 points to
6.0%, while the underutilisation rate (the unemployed plus the under-employed)
decreased by 0.1 points to 14.4% seasonally adjusted.

In 2007, 228,621 Newstart unemployment allowance recipients were registered, a
total that increased to 646,414 or 5.3% of the total labour force by March
2013. As of December 2018, the number of Newstart recipients stands at 722,923
or 5.4% of the labour force.

The accuracy of official unemployment figures has been brought into question
in the Australian media due to discrepancies between the methods of different
research bodies (Roy Morgan versus the ABS), differing definitions of the term
'unemployed' and the ABS' practice of counting under-employed people as
"employed".

As of February 2024, the Australia labour force were employed in the following
industries (seasonally adjusted) :

Rank | Industry | No. of employees  
('000s) | % of total   
---|---|---|---  
1 | Health care and social assistance | 2228.1 | 15.6%   
2 | Retail trade | 1345.4 | 9.4%   
3 | Construction | 1320.0 | 9.2%

reflect recent events or newly available information. _( May 2025)_  
---|---  
  
According to the Australian Graduate Survey done by _Graduate Careers
Australia_ , full-time employment for newly qualified professionals from
various occupations (around four months after the completion of their
qualifications) experienced some declines between 2012 and 2015. Some examples
are:

Field of Education | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | Change 2012–2015   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Dentistry | 23.6% | 83.3% | 32.1% | 96.7% | +3.1%  
Computer Science | 24.7% | 70.3% | 67.2% | 67% | -7.7%  
Architecture | 63.9% | 11.0% | 57.8% | 70.2% | +6.3%  
Psychology | 61.1% | 56.1% | 42.0% | 55.2% | -7.9%

Education (post-initial) | 12.8% | 71.4% | 69.2% | 72.7% | +13.9%  
  
The Graduate Careers Survey 2014 explained, "However, GCA's Beyond Graduation
Survey (BGS) indicates that the middle- and longer-term outlook is very
positive, with the employment figures for 2010 graduates growing by 14
percentage points three years later." The Beyond Graduation Survey 2013
included 12,384 responses and the Graduate Careers Survey 2014 survey included
113,263 responses ("59.3 per cent of the almost 191,000 Australian resident
graduates who were surveyed responded to the AGS.")

The professional associations of some of these occupations expressed their
criticism of the immigration policy in 2014.

### Industry

#### Mining

Australian energy resources and major export ports map

In 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gold; 8th largest
world producer of silver; 6th largest world producer of copper; the world's
largest producer of iron ore; the world's largest producer of bauxite; the 2nd
largest world producer of manganese; 2nd largest world producer of lead; 3rd
largest world producer of zinc; 3rd largest world producer of cobalt; 3rd
largest producer of uranium; 6th largest producer of nickel; 8th largest world
producer of tin; 14th largest world producer of phosphate; 15th largest world
producer of sulfur; in addition to being the 5th largest world producer of
salt. The country is also a major producer of precious stones. Australia is
the world's largest producer of opal and is one of the largest producers of
diamond, ruby, sapphire and jade. In non-renewable energies, in 2020, the
country was the 30th largest producer of oil in the world, extracting 351.1
thousand barrels / day. In 2019, the country consumed 1 million barrels / day
(20th largest consumer in the world). The country was the 20th largest oil
importer in the world in 2018 (461.9 thousand barrels / day). In 2015,
Australia was the 12th largest world producer of natural gas, 67.2 billion m3
per year. In 2019, the country was the 22nd largest gas consumer (41.9 billion
m3 per year) and was the 10th largest gas exporter in the world in 2015: 34.0
billion m3 per year. In the production of coal, the country was the 4th
largest in the world in 2018: 481.3 million tons. Australia is the 2nd largest
coal exporter in the world (387 million tons in 2018).

In 2014–15 mineral extraction in Australia was valued at 212 billion
Australian dollars. Of this, coal represented 45,869 million, oil and natural
gas 40,369 million, iron ore 69,486 million, gold ore 13,685 million, and
other metals 7,903 million.

Coal is mined primarily in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Fifty-
four per cent of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to East Asia.
In 2000–01, 258.5 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6 million tonnes
exported. Coal provides about 85% of Australia's electricity production. In
fiscal year 2008–09, 487 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 261 million
tonnes exported. Australia is the world's leading coal exporter.

The Australian mining corporations Rio Tinto Group and BHP are among the
largest in the world.

Rio Tinto's Argyle mine in Western Australia was the second-largest diamond
mine in the world. The Argyle mine opened in 1983 and has produced more than
95 per cent of Australia's diamonds, including some of the world's most
valuable pink and red diamonds. Due to the depletion of ore, Argyle closed in
2020—the closure was expected to reduce Australia's yearly diamond output from
14.2 million carats to 134.7 thousand carats.

#### Manufacturing

The manufacturing industry in Australia has declined from 30% of GDP in the
1960s to 12% of GDP in 2007.

In 2008, four companies mass-produced cars in Australia. Mitsubishi ceased
production in March 2008, followed by Ford in 2016, and Holden and Toyota in
2017.

Until trade liberalisation in the mid-1980s, Australia had a large textile
industry. This decline continued through the first decade of the 21st century.
Since the 1980s, tariffs have steadily been reduced; in early 2010, the
tariffs were reduced from 17.5 per cent to 10 per cent on clothing, and
7.5–10% to 5% for footwear and other textiles. As of 2010, most textile
manufacturing, even by Australian companies, is performed in Asia.

Total employment in Australian textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing
(thousands of people) since 1984

#### Agriculture

In 2019, the value added from agriculture, fishing and forestry combined made
up approximately 2.1% of Australia's GDP. 60% of farm products are exported.
Irrigation is an important and widespread practice for a country where many
parts receive low rainfall. Agriculture, forestry and fishing was the second-
strongest [_clarification needed_] industry from 2013 to 2015, with the number
of employees growing from 295,495 in February 2013 to 325,321 in February
2015.

### Services

IT-related jobs (such as computer systems design and engineering) are defined
as Professional, Scientific and Technical Services by the Department of
Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of Australia. IT job creation
occurs mostly in the state capital cities of Australia.

#### Finance

Australia's "big four banks" (National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank,
Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and Westpac) are among the 'World's 50
Safest Banks' as of April 2012.

Between 1991 and 2013, 36,720 mergers and acquisitions with a total known
value of US$2,040 billion with the involvement of Australian firms have been
announced. In the year 2013, 1,515 transactions valued at US$78 billion had
been announced which was a decrease in terms of numbers (−18%) and value
(−11%) compared to 2012. The largest takeover or merger transaction involving
Australian companies was the 2007 takeover of the Coles Group by Wesfarmers,
totalling A$22 billion.

#### Tourism

Monthly short-term arrivals in Australia since 1991. The large drop in
arrivals in 2020 is due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the financial year 2017/18, tourism represented 3.1% of Australia's GDP
contributing A$57.2 billion to the national economy. Domestic tourism is a
significant part of the tourism industry, representing 73% of the total direct
tourism GDP.

In calendar year 2018, there were 9.3 million visitor arrivals. Tourism
employed 646,000 people in Australia in 2017–18, 5.2% of the workforce. About
43.7% of persons employed in tourism were part-time. Tourism also contributed
8.0% of Australia's total export earnings in 2010–11.

#### Creativity and culture

Growing importance is being given to the economic contribution of the creative
industries to the national economy. The United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) recompiles statistics about the export and import of
goods and services related to the creative industries. The World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) has assisted in the preparation of national
studies measuring the size of over 50 copyright industries around the world.
According to the WIPO compiled data, the national contribution of Creative
industries varies from 2% to 11% depending on the country.

The Australian Copyright Council (ACC) has been consistently compiling reports
using the WIPO-guided framework on the impact of the copyright-based
industries to Australia's economy in 2011, 2012, and 2014. In the most up-to-
date WIPO-supported study published in 2017, the copyright industries
contributed $122.8 billion to the Australian economy in 2016 amounting to 7.4%
of Australia's total economic output. The 2016 figure represented an increase
of $8.5 billion compared to 2011, with a growth in value added growing at 1.4%
per annum (since 2011). Further, it found that these industries generated more
economic output than the manufacturing, health care and mining sectors in
2016, and moved from being the 7th largest industry in 2011 to the 3rd in
2016.

#### Media

In 2018, Australia was ranked 19th out of 180 countries in accordance to press
freedom. The media industry is highly consolidated, with News Corp Australia
and Nine Entertainment publishing the majority of popular newspapers, owning
multiple television and radio stations, and providing the two major Australian
streaming services, Binge and Stan. Other major media companies include Ten
Network, Seven West Media and the national broadcasters ABC and SBS.

#### Education

School attendance is compulsory in Australia, from the age of 5 up until
approximately 16 (although it varies between each state and territory).
Australia also has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in
2003.

In the Programme for International Student Assessment, Australia regularly
scores among the top five of thirty major developed countries (member
countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). In
2018 there were 525,054 international students in Australia, comprising a
market of 32,2 billion A$.

#### Logistics

## Infrastructure

### Transportation

A map of major roads in Australia. Roads are the main method of transport in
Australia.

Australia's total transport activity contributed 7.9% to GDP in 2020–21, being
highly dependent on road transport. It is estimated that roads contribute to
more than A$245 billion, to the economic activity, significantly serving to
agriculture, forestry, fishing, manufacturing and construction industries.
There are more than 300 airports with paved runways. Passenger rail transport
includes widespread commuter networks in the major capital cities with more
limited intercity and interstate networks. The Australian mining sector is
reliant upon rail to transport its product to Australia's ports for export.

### Energy

Australian renewable power plants

The Australian economy is dependent on imported crude oil and petroleum
products, the economy's petroleum import dependency is around 80%—crude oil +
petroleum products.

## Trade and economic performance

Australia

Free trade agreements in force

In the second half of the 20th century, Australian trade shifted away from
Europe and North America to Japan and other East Asian markets. Regional
franchising businesses, now a $128 billion sector, have been operating co-
branded sites overseas for years with new investors coming from Western
Australia and Queensland.

In the late 19th century, Australia's economic strength relative to the rest
of the world was reflected in its GDP. In 1870, Australia had the highest GDP
per capita in the world due to economic growth fuelled by its natural
resources. However, as Australia's population grew rapidly over the 20th
century, its GDP per capita dropped relative to countries such as the US and
Norway. However, the Australian economy has been performing nominally better
than other economies of the OECD and has supported economic growth for over 20
consecutive years. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australian per
capita GDP growth is higher than that of New Zealand, US, Canada and The
Netherlands. The past performance of the Australian economy has been heavily
influenced by US, Japanese and Chinese economic growth.

### Australian national debt

Australia's net external debt exceeded $1 trillion in April 2017 as a result
of Australia's structural current account deficits. Although these deficits
have narrowed over the last decade due to an increase in net merchandise
trade, this effect has been partly offset by the return of Australian
government debt; net federal debt was estimated at $326.0 billion in the
2016–17 federal budget of which 60% is owed to foreigners. The entirety of the
debt has been accumulated through ten straight budget deficits as Australia
had negative net government debt (i.e. The Australian government had net
positive bond holdings) a decade earlier in the 2006–07 fiscal year.

### Chinese investment

There is substantial export to China of iron ore, wool and other raw
materials, and over 120,000 Chinese students study in Australian schools and
universities. China is the largest purchaser of Australian debt. In 2009,
offers were made by state-owned Chinese companies to invest $22 billion in
Australia's resource extraction industry.

The Signing of the China-Australia Free-Trade Agreement, signed November 2014,
has the potential to drastically increase Chinese Investments as agriculture
and services become more lenient.

Australia's special investor visa program introduced in 2012 encouraged
Chinese investment. The visa program fast-tracks visas and eases the residency
requirement for a permanent visa for those ready to invest over five million
Australian dollars into state government bonds, specific infrastructure and
property investments. Wealthy Chinese interested in direct investment began
looking to Australia after Canada started scaling back its investment visa
program in 2012 and eliminated its main investor visa program in 2014. In
early 2014 it was reported that the Australia's special investor visa was
granted to 65 mostly Chinese millionaires who brought over $440 million into
the country. By 2017, almost 90% of the more than 1,300 foreigners who used
Australia's special investor visa program were from China. Australia also has
an investor visa program with a required investment of one million Australian
dollars but with more restrictions and a lengthier period of time to get a
permanent visa.

In 2017, it was reported that Australia is the third-most popular destination
for Chinese to invest wealth offshore, with a 7% increase in Chinese private
wealth flowing into Australia while interest in the top two investment
destinations, Hong Kong and the United States, fell by 18% and 3%,
respectively. In 2017 there were 1.6 million high-net-worth Chinese (with at
least 10 million Chinese yuan to invest) and 24 per cent of the 3,000 wealthy
Chinese surveyed had private investments in Australia. Migration was one of
the top three reasons for Chinese investment offshore.

In 2018, in the Lowy Institute poll there had a sharp rise in the proportion
of the Australian population who say the Australian government is "allowing
too much investment from China".[_citation needed_]

This number rose from 56 per cent in 2014 to 72 per cent in 2018.

### Australia's balance of payments

Australia's current account (in $M) since 1959 Australia's current account as
a proportion of GDP since 1959

In trade terms, the Australian economy has had persistently large current
account deficits (CADs) for more than 50 years. One of the factors that
undermines balance of payments is Australia's export base, making it highly
vulnerable to the volatility in the prices of commodity goods. In addition,
due to a colonial heritage a lot of companies operating in Australia are
foreign-owned and, as a result, Australia's net income outlay between it and
the rest of the world is always negative; this results in persistent current
account deficits even when there is a positive export.

Dependent upon commodities, the Australian government endeavoured to redevelop
the Australian manufacturing sector. This initiative, also known as
microeconomic reform, helped Australian manufacturing to grow from 10.1% in
1983–1984 to 17.8% in 2003–2004.

There are other factors that have contributed to the extremely high current
account deficit in Australia such as lack of international competitiveness.

However, as Australia's CAD is almost entirely generated by the private
sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford's 'Consenting Adults Thesis'
in the early 1990s, there is an argument that the CAD is not a significant
issue. Historically, Australia has relied on overseas capital to fill the gap
between domestic savings and investment, and many of these investment
opportunities could not have been pursued if Australia did not have access to
foreign savings. This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level
and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment
that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns
to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign
liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.

### Personal wealth

GNI per capita in 2015

According to the 2011 Credit Suisse Global Wealth report, Australia's wealth
per adult had quadrupled over the past decade, and its total wealth was US$6.4
trillion. In the report Australia was the second-wealthiest country in the
world behind Switzerland based on average wealth per adult, and had the
highest median wealth in the world (US$222,000, nearly four times the amount
of each US adult) and a proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 that
was eight times the world average. This was attributed to a resilient
Australian dollar, property ownership levels and a strong labour market.
Compared to the rest of the world, very few Australians had a net worth of
less than US$1,000, which was attributed to relatively low credit card and
student loan debt. In 2013, Australia was identified by the Credit Suisse as
retaining its 2012 position as the nation with the second-highest average
wealth per adult (US$403,000); however, the nation's poverty rate was also
reported to have increased from 10.2% in 2000–01 to 11.8% at the time of the
2013 report on global wealth.

Despite the economic slowdown, in the 2014 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report,
Australia continued to have the second-highest average wealth per adult
(US$430,800) and the highest median wealth (US$225,400), with a total wealth
of $7.2 trillion. The average level of real assets (US$319,700) was the
second-highest in the world after Norway and 60% of gross household assets.
The report explained that this partly reflects a large endowment of land and
natural resources relative to population, and also high urban real estate
prices. Only 6% of Australians had a net worth below US$10,000, compared to
29% in the US and 70% for the world as a whole. The average debt was 20% of
gross assets. The proportion of people with wealth above US$100,000 was the
highest in the world (eight times the world average). Australia had 3.8%
(1,783,000 people) of the top 1% of global wealth holders while having 0.4% of
the world's adult population. The wealth share by Australia's top decile was
51.1% in 2000, 50.7% in 2007, and 51.1% in 2014. In 2016, Australia continued
to be the second-wealthiest nation in terms of wealth per adult.

In 2017, Australia was the world's top destination for millionaires, beating
the United States for the second consecutive year. An estimated 11,000
millionaires moved to Australia in 2016, compared with the 10,000 who moved to
the United States. Australia was especially attractive to Chinese millionaires
due to its relative proximity, cleaner environment, political and economic
stability, and investor visa programs. Also, the primary reason for
millionaires leaving China is top schools abroad that will give their children
a better education and career connections.

### Mergers and acquisitions

All in all over 43,150 deals have been completed national, inbound or outbound
Australia. This cumulates to an overall value of US$2,554 billion. There was a
strong upward trend between 1989 and 2007. In this peak year almost 3,100
deals took place, which is almost 60% more than in 2017, the current low.
Australian companies are particularly investing in the fields of metals and
minerals (15% of all deals from Australia into foreign countries). Runner-up
is the oil and gas industry with only 6.4%.

Here is a list of the top 10 deals with participation of Australian companies

## Poverty

In 2022 ACOSS released a report revealing that poverty is growing in
Australia, with an estimated 3.3 million people, or 13.5% of the population,
living below the internationally accepted poverty line of 50% of a country's
median income. It also estimated that there are 761,000 (17.7%) children under
the age of 15 that are in poverty. Indigenous Australians face significantly
higher poverty rates, with 30% of Indigenous households in income poverty,
emerging as the most socially and economically deprived group in Australia.

## Homelessness

There were 105,237 people experiencing homelessness in Australia on census
night in 2011. This equated to 1 in 200 Australians, and represented an
increase of 17% from the 2006 census, with the rate of homelessness increasing
from 45 per 10,000 to 49 per 10,000.

The number of homeless people in Australia jumped by more than 14,000—or 14
per cent—in the five years to 2016, according to census data. The Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said 116,000 people were homeless on census night
in 2016, representing 50 homeless people per 10,000.

## Climate change

According to the Climate Commission (now the Climate Council) report in 2013,
the extreme heatwaves, flooding and bushfires striking Australia have been
intensified by climate change and will get worse in future in terms of their
impacts on people, property, communities and the environment. The summer of
2012/2013 included the hottest summer, hottest month and hottest day on
record. The cost of the 2009 bushfires in Victoria was estimated at A$4.4bn
(£3bn) and the Queensland floods of 2010/2011 cost over A$5bn.

In 2008 the Treasurer and the Minister for Climate Change and Water released a
report that concluded the economy will grow with an emissions trading scheme
in place.

A report released in October 2009 by the Standing Committee on Climate Change,
Water, Environment and the Arts, studying the effects of a 1-metre sea level
rise, quite possible within the next 30–60 years, concluded that around
700,000 properties around Australia, including 80,000 buildings, would be
inundated, the collective value of these properties is estimated at $155
billion.

In 2019 the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and
Sciences published a report about the impact of climate change on the
profitability of the Australian agriculture, saying that the profit of the
Australian farms was cut by 22% due to climate change in the years 2000–2019.

According to the 2022 IPCC report Australia will lose billions of dollars due
to loss of life, and physical damages. These natural disasters are caused by
climate change and increasing global warming will worsen these events. The
report estimates that under 2 degrees of warming Australia will lose $115
billion in the next decade, and $350 billion in the next twenty years. If
warming goes up to under 3 degrees of warming Australia's economy will lose
$200 billion and $600 billion by 2042.

#### Agriculture forestry and livestock

Small changes caused by global warming, such as a longer growing season, a
more temperate climate and increased CO2 concentrations, may benefit
Australian crop agriculture and forestry in the short term.[_citation needed_]
However, such benefits are unlikely to be sustained with increasingly severe
effects of global warming. Changes in precipitation and consequent water
management problems will further exacerbate Australia's current water
availability and quality challenges, both for commercial and residential use.

The CSIRO predicts that the additional results in Australia of a temperature
rise of between 3 and 4 °C will be:

  * 32% possibility of diminished wheat production (without adaptation).
  * 45% probability of wheat crop value being beneath present levels (without adaptation).
  * 55% of primary habitat lost for Eucalyptus.
  * 25–50% rise in common timber yield in cool and wet parts of South Australia.
  * 25–50% reduction in common timber yield in North Queensland and the Top End.
  * 6% decrease in Australian net primary production (for 20% precipitation decrease)
  * 128% increase in tick-associated losses in net cattle production weight.

#### Electricity demand

Use of domestic air conditioners during severe heatwaves can double
electricity demand, placing great stress on electricity generation and
transmission networks, and lead to load shedding. In addition, bushfires can
damage electricity lines, while repairing power poles and power line damages
is often restricted during hot and dry weather because of high fire risks.
