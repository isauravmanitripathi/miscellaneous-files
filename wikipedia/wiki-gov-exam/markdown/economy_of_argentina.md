The **economy of Argentina** is the second-largest national economy in South
America, behind Brazil. Argentina has a human Development Index classified as
"very high" by the United Nations, with a highly literate population, an
export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.

Argentina benefits from rich natural resources. However, its economic
performance has historically been very uneven, with high economic growth
alternating with severe recessions, particularly since the late twentieth
century. Income maldistribution and poverty have increased since this period.
Early in the twentieth century, Argentina had one of the ten highest per
capita GDP levels globally. It was on par with Canada and Australia and had
surpassed both France and Italy.

Argentina's currency declined by about 50% in 2018 from 18 to 20 Argentine
pesos, to more than 38 Argentine pesos per U.S. Dollar. As of that year, it is
under a stand-by program from the International Monetary Fund. In 2019, the
currency fell further by 25%. In 2020, it fell by 90%, in 2021, 68%, and a
further 52% in 2022 (until July 20).

Argentina is considered an emerging market by the FTSE Global Equity Index
(2018), and one of the G-20 major economies. In 2021, MSCI re-classified
Argentina as a standalone market due to prolonged severe capital controls.

## History

Historical development of GDP per capita

Before the 1880s, Argentina was a relatively isolated backwater, dependent on
the salted meat, wool, leather, and hide industries for both the more
significant part of its foreign exchange and the generation of domestic income
and profits. The Argentine economy began to experience swift growth after 1880
through the export of livestock and grain raw materials, and British and
French investment, marking the beginning of a fifty-year era of significant
economic expansion and mass European immigration.[_citation needed_]

From 1880 to 1905, this expansion resulted in a 7.5-fold growth in GDP during
its most vigorous period, averaging about 8% annually.[_citation needed_] One
important measure of development, GDP per capita, rose from 35% of the United
States average to about 80% during that period. Growth then slowed
considerably, such that by 1941 Argentina's real per capita GDP was roughly
half that of the U.S. Even so, from 1890 to 1950, the country's per capita
income was similar to that of Western Europe; although income in Argentina
remained considerably less evenly distributed. According to a study by Baten
and Pelger and Twrdek (2009), where the authors compare anthropometric values,
i.e., height with real wages, Argentina's GDP increased for the decades after
1870.[_citation needed_] Before 1910 however, the heights have been left
unaffected. This, in turn, suggests that the increase in the population's
welfare did not occur during the income expansion of the given
period.[_citation needed_]

The Great Depression caused Argentine GDP to fall by a fourth between 1929 and
1932. Having recovered its lost ground by the late 1930s partly through import
substitution, the economy continued to grow modestly during World War II
(contrary to the recession caused by the previous world war).[_citation
needed_] The war led to reduced availability of imports and higher prices for
Argentine exports that combined to create a US$1.6 billion cumulative surplus,
a third of which was blocked as inconvertible deposits in the Bank of England
by the Roca–Runciman Treaty. Benefiting from innovative self-financing and
government loans alike, value-added in manufacturing nevertheless surpassed
that of agriculture for the first time in 1943, employed over 1 million by
1947, and allowed the need for imported consumer goods to decline from 40% of
the total to 10% by 1950.[_citation needed_]

The populist administration of Juan Perón nationalized the Central Bank,
railways, and other strategic industries and services from 1945 to 1955.
Inflation first became a chronic problem during this period, averaging 26%
annually from 1944 to 1974. The GDP per capita increased until the early
1950s, where commodity prices dropped and the effects of nationalization led
to stagnation.

The economy continued to decline during the National Reorganization Process
from 1976 to 1983 and for some time afterward. The dictatorship's chief
economist, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, advanced a controversial, neoliberal
policy of financial liberalization that increased the debt burden and failed
to curb inflation, which reached 344% in 1983. While black markets and
shortages disappeared as price and exchange controls were removed, the
currency devalued tenfold and the economy failed to grow.

Record foreign debt interest payments, tax evasion, and capital flight
resulted in a balance of payments crisis that plagued Argentina with severe
stagflation from 1975 to 1990, including a bout of hyperinflation in 1989 and
1990.[_citation needed_] Attempting to remedy this situation, economist
Domingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar in 1991 and limited the
money supply's growth. His team then embarked on a path of trade
liberalization, deregulation, and privatization. Inflation dropped to single
digits, and GDP grew by one third in four years.[_citation needed_]

External economic shocks and a dependency on volatile short-term capital and
debt to maintain the overvalued fixed exchange rate diluted benefits, causing
erratic economic growth from 1995 and the eventual collapse in 2001. That year
and the next, the economy suffered its sharpest decline since 1930; by 2002,
Argentina had defaulted on its debt. Its GDP had declined by nearly 20% in
four years, unemployment reached 25%, and the peso had depreciated 70% after
being devalued and floated.[_citation needed_]

Argentina's socio-economic situation has since been steadily improving.
Expansionary policies and raw materials exports triggered a rebound in GDP
from 2003 onward. This trend has been primarily maintained, creating over five
million jobs and encouraging domestic consumption and fixed investment. Social
programs were strengthened, and a number of important firms privatized during
the 1990s were renationalized beginning in 2003. These include the postal
service, ASA (the water utility serving Buenos Aires), Pension funds
(transferred to ANSES), Aerolíneas Argentinas, the energy firm YPF, and the
railways.[_citation needed_]

The economy nearly doubled from 2002 to 2011, growing an average of 7.1%
annually and around 9% for five consecutive years between 2003 and
2007.[_citation needed_] Real wages rose by around 72% from their low point in
2003 to 2013. The 2008 financial crisis did affect the economy, with growth
slowing to nearly zero in 2009; but high economic growth then resumed, and GDP
expanded by around 9% in both 2010 and 2011. Foreign exchange controls,
austerity measures, persistent inflation, and downturns in Brazil, Europe, and
other important trade partners, contributed to slower growth beginning in
2012, however. Growth averaged just 1.3% from 2012 to 2014, and rose to 2.4%
in 2015.[_citation needed_]

The Argentine government bond market is based on GDP-linked bonds, and
investors, both foreign and domestic, netted record yields amid renewed
growth. Argentine debt restructuring offers in 2005 and 2010 resumed payments
on the majority of its almost US$100 billion in defaulted bonds and other debt
from 2001.[_citation needed_]

Historical growth of Argentina from 1961 to 2016

Holdouts controlling 7% of the bonds, including some small investors, hedge
funds, and vulture funds led by Paul Singer's Cayman Islands-based NML Capital
Limited, rejected the 2005 and 2010 offer to exchange their defaulted bonds.
Singer, who demanded US$832 million for Argentine bonds purchased for US$49
million in the secondary market in 2008, attempted to seize Argentine
government assets abroad and sued to stop payments from Argentina to the 93%
who had accepted the earlier swaps despite the steep discount. According to
estimates by Morgan Stanley, bondholders who instead accepted the 2005 offer
of 30 cents on the dollar had by 2012 received returns of about 90%. Argentina
settled with virtually all holdouts in February 2016 at the cost of US$9.3
billion; NML received US$2.4 billion, a 392% return on the original value of
the bonds.

While the Argentine Government considers debt leftover from illegitimate
governments unconstitutional odious debt, it has continued servicing this debt
despite the annual cost of around US$14 billion and despite being nearly
locked out of international credit markets with annual bond issues since 2002
averaging less than US$2 billion (which precludes most debt
rollover).[_citation needed_]

Nevertheless, Argentina has continued to hold successful bond issues, as the
country's stock market, consumer confidence, and overall economy continue to
grow. The country's successful, US$16.5 billion bond sale in April 2016 was
the largest in emerging market history.[_citation needed_]

In May 2018, Argentina's government asked the International Monetary Fund for
its intervention, with an emergency loan for a $30 billion bailout, as
reported by Bloomberg.[_citation needed_]

In May 2018, the official estimated inflation had peaked up to 25 percent a
year, and on 4 May Argentina's central bank raised interest rates on pesos to
40 percent from 27.25 percent, which is the highest in the world, since the
national currency had lost 18% of its value since the beginning of the
year.[_citation needed_]

In 2019, the inflation was considered the highest in 28 years according to the
index, ascending to 53.8%.[_citation needed_]

To the cause of the quarantine in 2020, in April, 143,000 SMEs will not be
able to pay salaries and fixed expenses for the month, even with government
assistance, so they will have to borrow or increase their capital
contribution, and approximately 35,000 companies consider closing their
business. even so, the president remains firm in his decision to maintain the
state of total quarantine. Despite cuts in the payment chain, some project 180
total days and calculate 5% of companies that fell in May.[_citation needed_]

In February 2023, the rate of inflation in Argentina surpassed 100% for the
first time since the early 1990s.

In December 2023, Argentina was seeing a projected 200% annualized inflation
rate of the Argentine Peso. With this inflation in mind, Javier Milei
(Argentina's newly sworn in president as of 10 December 2023, with 55.69% of
the vote in the runoff election) weakened the Argentine Peso by 50% to 800 per
dollar in order to bring the official exchange rate (which was only used in
theory) down to the market exchange range, along with cuts to energy
subsidies, cancellations of public works, and more in order to save nearly 20
billion dollars in expenses. These policies achieved a budget surplus for the
first time since 2012. Although these were impactful policies, Argentinians
knew Milei would enact sweeping economic reforms, as he openly supported
extreme economic policies as a self-described anarcho-capitalist. As part of
Javier Milei's plans the Government of Argentina announced in April 2024 a cut
of 15,000 state jobs.

Argentina's 2023 annual inflation was the highest in the world at 211.4%. In
January 2024, Argentina's poverty rate reached 57.4%, the highest poverty rate
in the country since 2004. Because of Milei's policies, the monthly inflation
rate dropped to 2.4% in December 2024, marking an end to Argentina's period of
hyperinflation. The poverty rate has seen a significant decrease in the 3rd
quarter of 2024, steadily falling to 38.9% (lower than 2022), projected to
decrease further as Milei's reforms take effect. This figure has been
calculated by the Argentine government agency, the National Institute of
Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC). They have international oversight
from the IMF, lending credibility towards the calculation. In a Gallup poll on
the 10th of December, 2024, the approval ratings for Milei still held at over
50%, with trust in the government having doubled since 2023. The perception of
improvement in the standard of living has also seen a marked improvement, with
53% of Argentinians believing that their standard of living is improving,
reaching the same high as 2015. 41% believe the economy of their city is also
improving. However, challenges still remain, and 69% of Argentinians believe
it is a bad time to look for a job in this economy, while 35% don't have
enough money for food, although these figures are a modest decrease from their
2 decade high in 2019. 59% of the richest 20%, but 39% of the poorest 20%
approve of Milei's governance, though the ratings are still higher across the
board when compared to Milei's predecessor, Alberto Fernandez.

In the first and second quarter of 2024, Argentina's GDP contracted by 2.1%
and 1.8%. However, in the last quarter, it expanded 3.9% despite the
significant austerity implemented by the president. Conversely, agriculture
rebounded dramatically from a severe drought, achieving an impressive growth
rate of 80.2% as conditions improved. The economy of Argentina is projected to
grow by 5.5% in 2025 by the BBVA, and 3.5% by Goldman Sach's as inflation
stabilizes and investment starts pouring in due to the Milei's liberalisation
of the economy. The financial improvements seen in the 3rd quarter of 2024 are
complemented by society's renewed confidence in the government, creating a
positive outlook for 2025. Favourable results and normalization in Argentina's
economy are expected to continue in 2025. The annual inflation rate, which was
211% in 2023, is expected to be below 30% in 2025. Economic activity has also
begun to recover after the severe recession at the beginning of 2024. The
economy is expected to expand by more than 4% in 2025.

Soy field in Argentina's fertile Pampas. The versatile legume makes up about
half the nation's crop production. Vineyard in Mendoza Province. The country
is the fifth largest producer in the world.

Argentina is one of the world's major agricultural producers, ranking among
the top producers in most of the following, exporters of beef, citrus fruit,
grapes, honey, maize, sorghum, soybeans, squash, sunflower seeds, wheat, and
yerba mate. Agriculture accounted for 9% of GDP in 2010, and around one fifth
of all exports (not including processed food and feed, which are another
third). Commercial harvests reached 103 million tons in 2010, of which over 54
million were oilseeds (mainly soy and sunflower), and over 46 million were
cereals (mainly maize, wheat, and sorghum).

Argentina is the largest producer in the world of yerba mate, one of the 5
largest producers in the world of soy, maize, sunflower seed, lemon and pear,
one of the 10 largest producers in the world of barley, grape, artichoke,
tobacco and cotton, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of wheat,
sugarcane, sorghum and grapefruit.

In 2018, Argentina was the 3rd largest producer of soy in the world, with 37.7
million tons produced (behind only the US and Brazil); the 4th largest
producer of maize in the world, with 43.5 million tons produced (behind only
the US, China and Brazil); the 12th largest producer of wheat in the world,
with 18.5 million tons produced; the 11th largest producer in the world of
sorghum, with 1.5 million tons produced; the 10th largest producer of grape in
the world, with 1.9 million tons produced, besides having produced 19 million
tons of sugarcane, mainly in the province of Tucumán \- Argentina produces
near 2 million tons of sugar with the produced cane. In the same year
Argentina produced 4.1 million tons of barley, being one of the 20 largest
producers in the world of this cereal. The country is also one of the world's
largest producers of sunflower seed: in 2010, it was the 3rd largest producer
in the world with 2.2 million tons. In 2018, Argentina also produced 2.3
million tons of potato, almost 2 million tons of lemon, 1.3 million tons of
rice, 1 million tons of orange, 921 thousand tons of peanut, 813 thousand tons
of cotton, 707 thousand tons of onion, 656 thousand tons of tomato, 565
thousand tons of pear, 510 thousand tons of apple, 491 thousand tons of oats,
473 thousand tons of beans, 431 thousand tons of tangerine, 302 thousand tons
of yerba mate, 283 thousand tons of carrot, 226 thousand tons of peach, 194
thousand tons of cassava, 174 thousand tons of olives, 174 thousand tons of
banana, 148 thousand tons of garlic, 114 thousand tons of grapefruit, 110
thousand tons of artichoke, in addition to smaller productions of other
agricultural products.

In livestock, Argentina was, in 2019, the 4th world producer of beef, with a
production of 3 million tons (only behind USA, Brazil and China), the 4th
world producer of honey, the 10th world producer of wool, the world's 13th
largest producer of chicken meat, the world's 23rd largest producer of pork,
the 18th largest producer of cow's milk and the world's 14th largest producer
of chicken egg.

Soy and its byproducts, mainly animal feed and vegetable oils, are major
export raw materials with one fourth of the total; cereals added another 10%.
Cattle-raising is also a major industry, though mostly for domestic
consumption; beef, leather and dairy were 5% of total exports. Sheep-raising
and wool are important in Patagonia, though these activities have declined by
half since 1990. Biodiesel, however, has become one of the fastest growing
agro-industrial activities, with over US$2 billion in exports in 2011.

Fruits and vegetables made up 4% of exports: apples and pears in the Río Negro
valley; rice, oranges and other citrus in the northwest and Mesopotamia;
grapes and strawberries in Cuyo (the west), and berries in the far south.
Cotton and tobacco are major crops in the Gran Chaco, sugarcane and chile
peppers in the northwest, and olives and garlic in the west. Yerba mate tea
(Misiones), tomatoes (Salta) and peaches (Mendoza) are grown for domestic
consumption. Organic farming is growing in Argentina, and the nearly 3 million
hectares (7.5 million acres) of organic cultivation is second only to
Australia. Argentina is the world's fifth-largest wine producer, and fine wine
production has taken major leaps in quality. A growing export, total
viticulture potential is far from having been met. Mendoza is the largest wine
region, followed by San Juan.

Government policy towards the lucrative agrarian sector is a subject of, at
times, contentious debate in Argentina. A grain embargo by farmers protesting
an increase in export taxes for their products began in March 2008, and,
following a series of failed negotiations, strikes and lockouts largely
subsided only with the 16 July, defeat of the export tax-hike in the Senate.

Argentine fisheries bring in about a million tons of catch annually, and are
centered on Argentine hake, which makes up 50% of the catch; pollock, squid,
and centolla crab are also widely harvested. Forestry has long history in
every Argentine region, apart from the pampas, accounting for almost 14
million m3 of roundwood harvests. Eucalyptus, pine, and elm (for cellulose)
are also grown, mainly for domestic furniture, as well as paper products (1.5
million tons). Fisheries and logging each account for 2% of exports.

The Vaca Muerta tight oil (shale oil) field holds 2.58×109 m3 (16.2×10~~^~~ 9
bbl) of oil and 8.7×10~~^~~ 12 m3 (308×10~~^~~ 12 cu ft) of natural gas. It is
estimated to be the third largest in the world.

### Natural resources

Mining and other extractive activities, such as gas and petroleum, are growing
industries, increasing from 2% of GDP in 1980 to around 4% today. The
northwest and San Juan Province are the main regions of activity. Coal is
mined in Santa Cruz Province. Metals and minerals mined include borate,
copper, lead, magnesium, sulfur, tungsten, uranium, zinc, silver, titanium,
and gold, whose production was boosted after 1997 by the Bajo de la Alumbrera
mine in Catamarca Province and Barrick Gold investments a decade later in San
Juan. Metal ore exports soared from US$200 million in 1996 to US$1.2 billion
in 2004, and to over US$3 billion in 2010.

In 2019, Argentina was the 4th largest world producer of lithium, the 9th
largest world producer of silver, the 17th largest world producer of gold and
the 7th largest world producer of boron.

Around 35 million m3 each of petroleum and petroleum fuels are produced, as
well as 50 billion m3 of natural gas, making the nation self-sufficient in
these staples, and generating around 10% of exports. The most important oil
fields lie in Patagonia and Cuyo. A network of pipelines send raw product to
Bahía Blanca, center of the petrochemical industry, and to the La Plata-
Greater Buenos Aires-Rosario industrial belt.

### Industry

The World Bank lists the top producing countries each year, based on the total
value of production. According to the 2019 list, Argentina has the 31st most
valuable industry in the world (57.7 billion dollars), behind Mexico, Brazil
and Venezuela, but ahead of Colombia, Peru and Chile.

In 2019, Argentina was the 31st world producer of steel, the 28th producer of
vehicles, the 22nd world producer of beer, the 4th world producer of soybean
oil and the 3rd world producer of sunflower oil, among other industrial
products.

Manufacturing is the largest single sector in the nation's economy (15% of
GDP), and is well-integrated into Argentine agriculture, with half the
nation's industrial exports being agricultural in nature. Based on food
processing and textiles during its early development in the first half of the
20th century, industrial production has become highly diversified in
Argentina. Leading sectors by production value are: food processing and
beverages; motor vehicles and auto parts; refinery products, and biodiesel;
chemicals and pharmaceuticals; steel and aluminium; and industrial and farm
machinery; electronics and home appliances. These latter include over three
million big ticket items,[_vague_] as well as an array of electronics, kitchen
appliances and cellular phones, among others.

Argentina's auto industry produced 791,000 motor vehicles in 2013, and
exported 433,000 (mainly to Brazil, which in turn exported a somewhat larger
number to Argentina); Argentina's domestic new auto market reached a record
964,000 in 2013. This marked a peak in vehicle production, by 2021 production
had fallen to 434,753 vehicles. Vehicles remain Argentina's top export to
Brazil, accounting for $3.1bil in exports in 2021.

Beverages are another significant sector, and Argentina has long been among
the top five wine producing countries in the world; beer overtook wine
production in 2000, and today leads by nearly two billion liters a year to
one. Other manufactured goods include: glass and cement; plastics and tires;
lumber products; textiles; tobacco products; recording and print media;
furniture; apparel and leather.

Most manufacturing is organized in the 314 industrial parks operating
nationwide as of 2012, a fourfold increase over the past decade. Nearly half
the industries are based in the Greater Buenos Aires area, although Córdoba,
Rosario, and Ushuaia are also significant industrial centers; the latter city
became the nation's leading center of electronics production during the 1980s.
The production of computers, laptops, and servers grew by 160% in 2011, to
nearly 3.4 million units, and covered two-thirds of local demand. Argentina
has also become an important manufacturer of cell phones, providing about 80%
of all devices sold in the country. Farm machinery, another important rubric
historically dominated by imports, was similarly replaced by domestic
production, which covered 60% of demand by 2013. Production of cell phones,
computers, and similar products is actually an "assembly" industry, with the
majority of the higher technology components being imported, and the designs
of products originating from foreign countries. High labour costs for
Argentina assembly work tend to limit product sales penetration to Latin
America, where regional trade treaties exist.

Construction permits nationwide covered over 15 million m2 (160 million ft2)
in 2013. The construction sector accounts for over 5% of GDP, and two-thirds
of construction is for residential buildings.

Argentine electric output totaled over 133 billion kWh in 2013. This was
generated in large part through well developed natural gas and hydroelectric
resources. Nuclear energy is also of high importance, and the country is one
of the largest producers and exporters, alongside Canada and Russia of
cobalt-60, a radioactive isotope widely used in cancer therapy.

### Services

---|---  
  
The service sector is the largest contributor to total GDP, accounting for
over 60%.[_citation needed_] Argentina enjoys a diversified service sector,
which includes well-developed social, corporate, financial, insurance, real
estate, transport, communication services, and tourism.

The telecommunications sector has been growing at a fast pace, and the economy
benefits from widespread access to communications services. These include: 77%
of the population with access to mobile phones, 95% of whom use smartphones;
Internet (over 32 million users, or 75% of the population); and broadband
services (accounting for nearly all 14 million accounts). Regular telephone
services, with 9.5 million lines, and mail services are also robust. Total
telecom revenues reached more than $17.8 billion in 2013, and while only one
in three retail stores in Argentina accepted online purchases in 2013,
e-commerce reached US$4.5 billion in sales.

Trade in services remained in deficit, however, with US$15 billion in service
exports in 2013 and US$19 billion in imports. Business Process Outsourcing
became the leading Argentine service export, and reached US$3 billion.
Advertising revenues from contracts abroad were estimated at over US$1.2
billion.

Tourism is an increasingly important sector and provided 4% of direct economic
output (over US$17 billion) in 2012; around 70% of tourism sector activity by
value is domestic.

#### Banking

---|---

Ecological Reserve

Argentine banking, whose deposits exceeded US$120 billion in December 2012,
developed around public sector banks, but is now dominated by the private
sector. The private sector banks account for most of the 80 active
institutions (over 4,000 branches) and holds nearly 60% of deposits and loans,
and as many foreign-owned banks as local ones operate in the country. The
largest bank in Argentina by far, however, has long been the public Banco de
la Nación Argentina. Not to be confused with the Central Bank, this
institution now accounts for 30% of total deposits and a fifth of its loan
portfolio.

During the 1990s, Argentina's financial system was consolidated and
strengthened. Deposits grew from less than US$15 billion in 1991 to over US$80
billion in 2000, while outstanding credit (70% of it to the private sector)
tripled to nearly US$100 billion.

The banks largely lent US dollars and took deposits in Argentine pesos, and
when the peso lost most of its value in early 2002, many borrowers again found
themselves hard pressed to keep up. Delinquencies tripled to about 37%. Over a
fifth of deposits had been withdrawn by December 2001, when Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo imposed a near freeze on cash withdrawals. The lifting of the
restriction a year later was bittersweet, being greeted calmly, if with some
umbrage, at not having these funds freed at their full U.S. dollar value. Some
fared worse, as owners of the now-defunct Velox Bank defrauded their clients
of up to US$800 million.

Credit in Argentina is still relatively tight. Lending has been increasing 40%
a year since 2004, and delinquencies are down to less than 2%. Still, credit
outstanding to the private sector is, in real terms, slightly below its 1998
peak, and as a percent of GDP (around 18%) quite low by international
standards. The prime rate, which had hovered around 10% in the 1990s, hit 67%
in 2002. Although it returned to normal levels quickly, inflation, and more
recently, global instability, have been affecting it again. The prime rate was
over 20% for much of 2009, and around 17% since the first half of 2010.

Partly a function of this and past instability, Argentines have historically
held more deposits overseas than domestically. The estimated US$173 billion in
overseas accounts and investment exceeded the domestic monetary base (M3) by
nearly US$10 billion in 2012.

#### Tourism

According to World Economic Forum's 2017 Travel & Tourism Competitiveness
Report, tourism generated over US$22 billion, or 3.9% of GDP, and the industry
employed more than 671,000 people, or approximately 3.7% of the total
workforce. Tourism from abroad contributed US$5.3 billion, having become the
third largest source of foreign exchange in 2004. Around 5.7 million foreign
visitors arrived in 2017, reflecting a doubling in visitors since 2002 despite
a relative appreciation of the peso.

Argentines, who have long been active travelers within their own country,
accounted for over 80%, and international tourism has also seen healthy growth
(nearly doubling since 2001). Stagnant for over two decades, domestic travel
increased strongly in the last few years[_which?_], and visitors are flocking
to a country seen as affordable, exceptionally diverse, and safe.

Foreign tourism, both to and from Argentina, is increasing as well. INDEC
recorded 5.2 million foreign tourist arrivals and 6.7 million departures in
2013; of these, 32% arrived from Brazil, 19% from Europe, 10% from the United
States and Canada, 10% from Chile, 24% from the rest of the Western
Hemisphere, and 5% from the rest of the world. Around 48% of visitors arrived
by commercial flight, 40% by motor travel (mainly from neighboring Brazil),
and 12% by sea. Cruise liner arrivals are the fastest growing type of foreign
tourism to Argentina; a total of 160 liners carrying 510,000 passengers
arrived at the Port of Buenos Aires in 2013, an eightfold increase in a just a
decade.

### Energy

Electricity generation in Argentina totaled 133.3 billion kWh in 2013. The
electricity sector in Argentina constitutes the third largest power market in
Latin America. It mainly still relies on centralised generation by natural gas
power generation (51%), hydroelectricity (28%), and oil-fired generation
(12%). Resource estimates of unconventional shale gas and tight oil in the
Vaca Muerta oil field and elsewhere are estimated to be the world's third-
largest. In 2017, Argentina was the 18th largest producer in the world (and
the largest producer in Latin America) of natural gas. In 2020, the country
was the 28th largest producer of oil in the world, extracting 70,000 m3
(440,300 bbl) per day.

Despite the country's large untapped wind and solar potential new renewable
energy technologies and distributed energy generation are barely exploited.
Wind energy is the fastest growing among new renewable sources. Fifteen wind
farms have been developed since 1994 in Argentina, the only country in the
region to produce wind turbines. The 55 MW of installed capacity in these in
2010 will increase by 895 MW upon the completion of new wind farms begun that
year. Solar power is being promoted with the goal of expanding installed solar
capacity from 6 MW to 300, and total renewable energy capacity from 625 MW to
3,000 MW. At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in
terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the
world in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the
world in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW).

Argentina is in the process of commissioning large centralised energy
generation and transmission projects. An important number of these projects
are being financed by the government through trust funds, while independent
private initiative is limited as it has not fully recovered yet from the
effects of the Argentine economic crisis.[_citation needed_]

The first of the three nuclear reactors was inaugurated in 1974, and in 2015
nuclear power generated 5% of the country's energy output.

The electricity sector was unbundled in generation, transmission and
distribution by the reforms carried out in the early 1990s. Generation occurs
in a competitive and mostly liberalized market, in which 75% of the generation
capacity is owned by private utilities. In contrast, the transmission and
distribution sectors are highly regulated and much less competitive than
generation.

## Infrastructure

Argentina's transport infrastructure is relatively advanced, and at a higher
standard than the rest of Latin America. There are over 230,000 km (144,000
mi) of roads (not including private rural roads) of which 72,000 km (45,000
mi) are paved, and 2,800 kilometres (1,700 mi) are expressways, many of which
are privatized tollways. Having tripled in length in the last decade,
multilane expressways now connect several major cities with more under
construction. Expressways are, however, currently inadequate to deal with
local traffic, as over 12 million motor vehicles were registered nationally as
of 2012 (the highest, proportionately, in the region).

The railway network has a total length of 37,856 kilometres (23,523 mi),
though at the network's peak this figure was 47,000 km (29,204 mi). After
decades of declining service and inadequate maintenance, most intercity
passenger services shut down in 1992 following the privatization of the
country's railways and the breaking up of the state rail company, while
thousands of kilometers fell into disuse. Outside Greater Buenos Aires most
rail lines still in operation are freight related, carrying around 23 million
tons a year. The metropolitan rail lines in and around Buenos Aires remained
in great demand owing in part to their easy access to the Buenos Aires
Underground, and the commuter rail network with its 833 kilometres (518 mi)
length carries around 1.4 million passengers daily.

In April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law
which re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos as Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos,
effectively re-nationalising the country's railways. In the years leading up
to this move, the country's railways had seen significant investment from the
state, purchasing new rolling stock, re-opening lines closed under
privatization and re-nationalising companies such as the Belgrano Cargas
freight operator. Some of these re-opened services include the General Roca
Railway service to Mar del Plata, the Tren a las Nubes tourist train and the
General Mitre Railway service from Buenos Aires to Córdoba. while brand new
services include the Posadas-Encarnación International Train.

Inaugurated in 1913, the Buenos Aires Underground was the first underground
rail system built in Latin America, the Spanish speaking world and the
Southern Hemisphere. No longer the most extensive in South America, its 60
kilometres (37 mi) of track carry a million passengers daily.

Argentina has around 11,000 km (6,835 mi) of navigable waterways, and these
carry more cargo than do the country's freight railways. This includes an
extensive network of canals, though Argentina is blessed with ample natural
waterways as well, the most significant among these being the Río de la Plata,
Paraná, Uruguay, Río Negro, and Paraguay rivers. The Port of Buenos Aires,
inaugurated in 1925, is the nation's largest; it handled 11 million tons of
freight and transported 1.8 million passengers in 2013.

Aerolíneas Argentinas is the country's main airline, providing both extensive
domestic and international service. LADE is a military-run commercial airline
that flies extensive domestic services. The nation's 33 airports handled air
travel totalling 25.8 million passengers in 2013, of which domestic flights
carried over 14.5 million; the nation's two busiest airports, Jorge Newbery
and Ministro Pistarini International Airports, boarded around 9 million
flights each.

## Foreign trade

In 2022, Argentina was the 44th largest exporter (by merchandise exports) in
the world (US$88 billion), 0.4% of the global total.

Argentine exports are fairly well diversified. However, although agricultural
raw materials are over 20% of the total exports, agricultural goods still
account for over 50% of exports when processed foods are included. Soy
products alone (soybeans, vegetable oil) account for almost one fourth of the
total. Cereals, mostly maize and wheat, which were Argentina's leading export
during much of the twentieth century, make up less than one tenth now.

Industrial goods today account for over a third of Argentine exports. Motor
vehicles and auto parts are the leading industrial export, and over 12% of the
total merchandise exports. Chemicals, steel, aluminum, machinery, and plastics
account for most of the remaining industrial exports. Trade in manufactures
has historically been in deficit for Argentina, however, and despite the
nation's overall trade surplus, its manufacturing trade deficit exceeded US$30
billion in 2011. Accordingly, the system of non-automatic import licensing was
extended in 2011, and regulations were enacted for the auto sector
establishing a model by which a company's future imports would be determined
by their exports (though not necessarily in the same rubric).

A net energy importer until 1987, Argentina's fuel exports began increasing
rapidly in the early 1990s and today account for about an eighth of the total;
refined fuels make up about half of that. Exports of crude petroleum and
natural gas have recently been around US$3 billion a year. Rapidly growing
domestic energy demand and a gradual decline in oil production, resulted in a
US$3 billion energy trade deficit in 2011 (the first in 17 years) and a US$6
billion energy deficit in 2013.

Argentine imports have historically been dominated by the need for industrial
and technological supplies, machinery, and parts, which have averaged US$50
billion since 2011 (two-thirds of total imports). Consumer goods including
motor vehicles make up most of the rest. Trade in services has historically in
deficit for Argentina, and in 2013 this deficit widened to over US$4 billion
with a record US$19 billion in service imports. The nation's chronic current
account deficit was reversed during the 2002 crisis, and an average current
account surplus of US$7 billion was logged between 2002 and 2009; this surplus
later narrowed considerably, and has been slightly negative since 2011.

## Foreign investment

Foreign direct investment in Argentina is divided nearly evenly between
manufacturing (36%), natural resources (34%), and services (30%). The chemical
and plastics sector (10%) and the automotive sector (6%) lead foreign
investment in local manufacturing; oil and gas (22%) and mining (5%), in
natural resources; telecommunications (6%), finance (5%), and retail trade
(4%), in services. Spain was the leading source of foreign direct investment
in Argentina, accounting for US$22 billion (28%) in 2009; the U.S. was the
second leading source, with $13 billion (17%); and China grew to become the
third-largest source of FDI by 2011. Investments from the Netherlands, Brazil,
Chile, and Canada have also been significant; in 2012, foreign nationals held
a total of around US$112 billion in direct investment.

Several bilateral agreements play an important role in promoting U.S. private
investment. Argentina has an Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)
agreement and an active program with the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Under the
1994 U.S.–Argentina Bilateral Investment Treaty, U.S. investors enjoy national
treatment in all sectors except shipbuilding, fishing, nuclear-power
generation, and uranium production. The treaty allows for international
arbitration of investment disputes.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Argentina, which averaged US$5.7 billion
from 1992 to 1998 and reached in US$24 billion in 1999 (reflecting the
purchase of 98% of YPF stock by Repsol), fell during the crisis to US$1.6
billion in 2003. FDI then accelerated, reaching US$8 billion in 2008. The
global crisis cut this figure to US$4 billion in 2009; but inflows recovered
to US$6.2 billion in 2010. and US$8.7 billion in 2011, with FDI in the first
half of 2012 up by a further 42%.

FDI volume remained below the regional average as a percent of GDP even as it
recovered, however; Kirchner Administration policies and difficulty in
enforcing contractual obligations had been blamed for this modest performance.
The nature of foreign investment in Argentina nevertheless shifted
significantly after 2000, and whereas over half of FDI during the 1990s
consisted in privatizations and mergers and acquisitions, foreign investment
in Argentina became the most technologically oriented in the region – with 51%
of FDI in the form of medium and high-tech investment (compared to 36% in
Brazil and 3% in Chile).

## Issues

The economy recovered strongly from the 2001–02 crisis, and was the 21st
largest in purchasing power parity terms in 2011; its per capita income on a
purchasing power basis was the highest in Latin America. A lobby representing
US creditors who refused to accept Argentina's debt-swap programmes has
campaigned to have the country expelled from the G20. These holdouts include
numerous vulture funds which had rejected the 2005 offer, and had instead
resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds.
These disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in
New York and, indirectly, to reduced Argentine access to international credit
markets.

The government under President Mauricio Macri announced to be seeking a new
loan from the International Monetary Fund in order to avoid another economic
crash similar to the one in 2001. The May 2018 announcement comes at a time of
high inflation and falling interest rates. The loan would reportedly be worth
$30 billion.

Following 25 years of boom and bust stagnation, Argentina's economy doubled in
size from 2002 to 2013, and officially, income poverty declined from 54% in
2002 to 5% by 2013; an alternative measurement conducted by CONICET found that
income poverty declined instead to 15.4%. Poverty measured by living
conditions improved more slowly, however, decreasing from 17.7% in the 2001
Census to 12.5% in the 2010 Census. Argentina's unemployment rate similarly
declined from 25% in 2002 to an average of around 7% since 2011 largely
because of both growing global demand for Argentine raw materials and strong
growth in domestic activity.

Given its ongoing dispute with holdout bondholders, the government has become
wary of sending assets to foreign countries (such as the presidential plane,
or artworks sent to foreign exhibitions) in case they might be impounded by
courts at the behest of holdouts.

The government has been accused of manipulating economic statistics.

### Reliability of official CPI estimates

Official CPI inflation figures released monthly by INDEC have been a subject
of political controversy since 2007 through 2015. Official inflation data are
disregarded by leading union leaders, even in the people sector, when
negotiating pay rises. Some private-sector estimates put inflation for 2010 at
around 25%, much higher than the official 10.9% rate for 2010. Inflation
estimates from Argentina's provinces are also higher than the government's
figures. The government backed up the validity of its data, but has called in
the International Monetary Fund to help it design a new nationwide index to
replace the current one.

The official government CPI is calculated based on 520 products, however the
controversy arises from these products not being specified, and thus how many
of those products are subject to price caps and subsidies. Economic analysts
have been prosecuted for publishing estimates that disagree with official
statistics. The government enforces a fine of up to 500,000 pesos for
providing what it calls "fraudulent inflation figures". Beginning in 2015, the
government again began to call for competitive bids from the private sector to
provide a weekly independent inflation index.

### Inflation

Argentina money supply increases year over year. Daily data points.

High inflation has been a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades.
Inflation has been unofficially estimated to be running at around 25% annually
since 2008, despite official statistics indicating less than half that figure;
these would be the highest levels since the 2002 devaluation. A committee was
established in 2010 in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies by opposition
Deputies Patricia Bullrich, Ricardo Gil Lavedra, and others to publish an
alternative index based on private estimates. Food price increases,
particularly that of beef, began to outstrip wage increases in 2010, leading
Argentines to decrease beef consumption per capita from 69 kg (152 lb) to 57
kg (125 lb) annually and to increase consumption of other meats.

Consumer inflation expectations of 28 to 30% led the national mint to buy
banknotes of its highest denomination (100 pesos) from Brazil at the end of
2010 to keep up with demand. The central bank pumped at least 1 billion pesos
into the economy in this way during 2011.

As of June 2015[update], the government said that inflation was at 15.3%;
approximately half that of some independent estimates. Inflation remained at
around 18.6% in 2015 according to an International Monetary Fund estimate; but
following a sharp devaluation enacted by the Mauricio Macri administration on
17 December, inflation reignited during the first half of 2016 – reaching 42%
according to the Finance Ministry.

Supermarkets in Argentina have adopted electronic price tags, allowing prices
to be updated more quickly.

In the second quarter of 2019, reports suggested that the economy of the
country is sinking, inflation is rising and the currency is depreciating.
Despite the country receiving one of the largest IMF financial support
programmes ever given to any nation, Argentina's poverty rose to 32% from 26%
the previous year. In August 2019, as an attempt to stabilise the economy, the
government decided to impose restrictions on foreign currency purchases.

The inflation rate in Argentina rose to 52.3 percent in February 2022 from
50.7 percent in the prior month, the steepest increase since September. In
August the interest rate was hiked to 69.5% as inflation further deteriorated
hitting a 20-year high at 70% driven by many factors among them the 2021–2022
inflation surge and forecasted to top 90% by the end of the year. Inflation
hit past 100% in February 2023 for the first time since 1991. On October 12,
2023, Argentina's central bank again increased the benchmark interest rate
from 118% to 133% since September's inflation report (12.7% monthly and 138%
annually) was worse than forecasted.

Argentine workers have protested the inflation holding funerals to mourn the
"death of (their) wages". Photographer Irina Werning wrote the following

investment." taking about the protest

After Milei's landslide victory in the presidential elections held on October
2023, large efforts were made to curb the inflation rate, with major
successes. in January of 2022, the monthly inflation rate kept increasing from
2.4% to a peak of 25% just before Milei's inauguration. Soon after coming to
power, he devalued the peso by 50% in order to cut the wide gap between the
official exchange rate (which was the theoretical evaluation of the peso) and
the market exchange rate (the rate which is used in practice). In a year he
brought it back down to a monthly 2.4%. However, because there was still a
significant gap between the official and market exchange rates, Milei had
enacted a decision to have a 2% monthly devaluation of the peso. This is an
active and intentional contributant to the inflation rate, meaning that the
real, monetary inflation rate is only 0.4%.

In 2024, the Argentinian Peso appreciated by 44.2% against the dollar,
outperforming all other currencies. In contrast, the second best performing
currency against the dollar is the Lira, which gained 21.2%, less than half of
the Peso's increase. These actions aimed to stabilize an economy teetering on
the brink of hyperinflation. The peso's strengthening doubled average wages in
dollar terms to $990.

### Income distribution

In relation to other Latin American countries, Argentina has a moderate to low
level of income inequality. Its Gini coefficient is of about 0.407 (2022). The
social gap is worst in the suburbs of the capital, where beneficiaries of the
economic rebound live in gated communities, and many of the poor live in slums
known as villas miserias.

In the mid-1970s, the most affluent 10% of Argentina's population had an
income 12 times that of the poorest 10%. That figure had grown to 18 times by
the mid-1990s, and by 2002, the peak of the crisis, the income of the richest
segment of the population was 43 times that of the poorest. These heightened
levels of inequality had improved to 26 times by 2006, and to 16 times at the
end of 2010. Economic recovery after 2002 was thus accompanied by significant
improvement in income distribution: in 2002, the richest 10% absorbed 40% of
all income, compared to 1.1% for the poorest 10%; by 2010, the former received
29% of income, and the latter, 1.8%.

Argentina has an inequality-adjusted human development index of 0.729,
compared to 0.578 and 0.709 for neighboring Brazil and Chile, respectively.
The 2010 Census found that poverty by living conditions still affect 1 in 8
inhabitants, however; and while the official, household survey income poverty
rate (based on U$S 100 per person per month, net) was 4.7% in 2013, the
National Research Council estimated income poverty in 2010 at 22.6%, with
private consulting firms estimating that in 2011 around 21% fell below the
income poverty line. The World Bank estimated that, in 2013, 3.6% subsisted on
less than US$3.10 per person per day.
