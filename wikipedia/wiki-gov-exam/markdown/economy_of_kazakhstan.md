The **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute
and per capita terms. As of 2023, Kazakhstan attracted more than US$370
billion of foreign investments since becoming an independent republic after
the dissolution of the former Soviet Union.

It possesses oil reserves as well as minerals and metals. Almost every known
element on the periodic table can be found in Kazakhstan. It also has
considerable agricultural potential, with its vast steppe lands accommodating
both livestock and grain production. The mountains in the south are important
for apples and walnuts; both species grow wild there. Kazakhstan's industrial
sector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of demand for
Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp
decline of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring
in 1994. In 1995–97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and
privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into
the private sector. Kazakhstan was granted "market economy country" status by
the European Union and the United States, in 2000 and 2002 respectively.

The December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to
build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field through Russia to
the Black Sea increased prospects for substantially larger oil exports until
Putin took issue with the lukewarm support he experienced in the wake of the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth
due to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A bright
spot in 1999 was the recovery of international petroleum prices, which,
combined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest,
pulled the economy out of recession.

GDP per capita shrank by 26% in the 1990s. In the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy
grew sharply, aided by increased prices on world markets for Kazakhstan's
leading exports: oil, metals and grain. GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in
1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by
10.6%. Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as
neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to
propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in
government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP
in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in
economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of
the Russo-Ukrainian War. The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014
and by 22% in 2015.

In 2023, the International Institute for Management Development compiled its
World Competitiveness Ranking, ranking Kazakhstan 37th out of 64 countries.
The ranking analyzes and ranks countries according to how they manage their
competencies to achieve long-term value creation.

Cyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia,
visited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during
the 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about
Kazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report
2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide. After 2000,
the government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New
Public Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and
increasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.

Kazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional
ranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World
Intellectual Property Organization.

The main producer of cotton pulp in Kazakhstan is Khlopkoprom. Judging by a
number of transactions, its products have been supplied to gunpowder
manufacturers in the Russian Federation since 2022. Most of the factories that
imported pulp from Kazakhstan for the manufacture of explosives are under US
and Ukrainian sanctions. According to OCCRP, Vlast, and iStories, a
significant increase in Kazakhstan's exports of cotton pulp and derivatives to
the Russian Federation after February 24, 2022, was identified. Exported
components are key in the manufacture of explosives and gunpowder. There are
contracts for the supply of raw materials to the Kazan Gunpowder Plant from
Kazakhstan until 2026, and to the Aleksinsky Chemical Plant (which also
produces gunpowder) until 2024.

## Macro-economic trend

GDP per capita development, since 1973

In the 2014 Economic Freedom Index published by The Heritage Foundation in
Washington, D.C., Kazakhstan has gained 22 points over the past 17 years,
which is noted by the authors as among the 20 best improvements recorded by
any country. Kazakhstan's economic freedom score is 69.1, equalling
"moderately free". Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, with
significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity
offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom. Kazakhstan is
ranked 11th among 43 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall
score is above the regional and world averages.

According to the World Bank’s latest Kazakhstan economic update – Economic
Recovery During Challenging Times (spring, 2023), the economy is set to
experience a moderate growth acceleration, with real GDP forecast to rise by
3.5 percent in 2023 and 4 percent in 2024 supported largely by the
hydrocarbons sector as oil production increases. In the 2023 Economic Freedom
Index published by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., Kazakhstan
ranks 71st out of 176 countries, falling in the group of "moderately free"
countries. Kazakhstan's economic freedom score is 62.1. Kazakhstan ranks 13th
out of 39 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above
the world and regional averages.

## Economic growth and GDP

According to the World Bank, Kazakhstan's economy grew by 5.1% in H1 2023,
driven by exports and fiscal stimulus. GDP is projected to grow by 4.5% in
2023 and subsequent years, aided by new oil production coming on-stream.

Kazakhstan's economy recorded an average real GDP growth rate of 3.0% in the
decade to 2022, above the 2.5% average for Eastern Europe. In 2022, real GDP
growth was 3.3%. The official estimate for Kazakhstan's GDP was $512 billion
at the end of 2022 in purchasing power parity terms.

The country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014. The country
experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil
prices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.

The Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with
IBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will
allocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy
and reaching the sustainable development.

The World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of
an upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170 billion.

Another 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.

Foreign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's
agricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products
sector.

In 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low
oil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National
Economy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%.
Sectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction
(6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).

The GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between
2013 and 2017.

Kazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing
Business 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28
to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed
Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th
place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.

Kazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy,
which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.

The biggest growth in 2020 occurred in the automotive industry (+53.6%),
pharmaceuticals (+39.7%), processed metal products (+19.5%), mechanical
engineering (+16.5%), as well as in light industry (+16.4%). The industries in
the service sector that demonstrated growth included construction (+10.7%) and
information and communications (+8.2%).

The World Bank reported that Kazakhstan's economy recorded a gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 3.2% in 2022. This was a part of the trend where the
economy was projected to grow by 3.9% in 2023, driven mainly by the
hydrocarbons sector and increased oil production.

## Sectors of economy

### Primary

#### Energy

Kazakhstan is the leading country in the world for uranium production volumes
with 35% of global production, and it has the world's second biggest uranium
reserves after Australia.

#### Oil and gas

Oil and gas is the leading economic sector. In 2000, Kazakhstan produced
35,252,000 metric tons of oil (700,000 barrels per day), a 17.4% increase over
1999's 30,025,000 tons. It exported 28,883,000 tons of oil in 2000, up 38.8%
from 20,813,000 tons in 1999. Production in 2001 has been growing at roughly
20%, on target to meet the government's forecast of 40,100,000 tons of oil
(800,000 barrels per day). In 2000, production reached 11.5 km3 of natural
gas, up from 8.2 km3 in 1999.

Kazakhstan has the potential to be a world-class oil exporter in the medium
term. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakhstan is the TengizChevroil
joint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by
KazMunaiGas of Kazakhstan, and 5% by LukArco of Russia. The Karachaganak
natural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip,
ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. The Agip-led Offshore Kazakhstan Consortium has
discovered potentially huge Kashagan oil field in the northern Caspian.
Kazakhstan's economic future is linked to oil and gas development. GDP growth
will depend on the price of oil, as well as the ability to develop new
deposits.

January 2022 began with thousands of people returning to the streets of
Kazakhstan to protest against the surging gas prices, recording four straight
days of demonstrations, which is claimed to be the biggest protests to have
taken place in the oil-rich country in decades. Protesters invaded into
government buildings and took over police vehicles despite a strict emergency
led by the state being in place.

#### Mining

Kazakhstan is a leading producer of many mineral commodities, including salt,
uranium, ferrochrome, titanium sponge, cadmium, potash, magnesium, rhenium,
copper, bauxite, gallium and zinc.

The country was the world's largest producer of uranium in 2022. In 2019, the
country was the world's 10th largest producer of gold; 11th largest world
producer of copper; 3rd largest worldwide producer of chromium; 9th largest
world producer of bauxite; 9th largest world producer of zinc; 10th largest
worldwide producer of antimony; 12th largest world producer of iron ore; 12th
largest world producer of lead; 14th largest world producer of manganese; 17th
largest world producer of phosphate; 6th largest world producer of bismuth,
and the 7th largest world producer of sulfur.

### Industry

#### Motor cars

In June 2014 the CKD (Complete Knock-Down) assembly of Toyota Fortuner was
launched in Kostanay, Kazakhstan. The expected annual output makes around
3,000 cars.

The Kazakhstan's car industry was developing rapidly in 2014 producing US$2
billion worth of products annually. Unfortunately, the industry experienced a
decline despite high hopes, with sales dwindling to only 47,000 in 2016.

In 2020, the Kazakh economy observed the biggest growth in its automotive
industry, which saw a 53.6% growth, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ongoing state support for the domestic auto industry, primarily through
recycling fees, is a contentious issue. For 20 years, the industry has largely
operated as a mere assembly hub, importing spare parts from abroad and
performing basic assembly tasks, such as fitting wheels—hardly advancing
towards establishing a truly Kazakh brand in the automotive sector. This
situation has fostered public dissent, notably from groups like #Нетутильсбору
[no recycling fee], who argue that such policies unfairly prioritize industry
support over the needs of regular citizens. This has contributed to an
increase in the average age of vehicles across Kazakhstan, as newer,
affordable options remain inaccessible for many. The group's primary demands
include the abolition of these recycling fees and a redirection of support
towards more pressing public needs, challenging the continued governmental
support that, they argue, effectively "mummifies" an unproductive industry.

#### Rail

GE Transportation acquired 50% stake in Lokomotiv Kurastyru Zauyty in a joint
venture with Kazakhstan's national railway company Temir Zholy.

### Services

#### Technology

On 22 December 2014 the World Bank approved a US$88 million loan that would
support Kazakhstan's efforts to facilitate commercially and socially viable
innovation in technology. The Fostering Productive Innovation Project aims to
improve the country in areas that are able to foster and support technological
innovation.

#### Retail

According to A.T. Kearney's 2015 Global Retail Development Index, Kazakhstan
ranked 13 out of 30. In the 2016th Index, Kazakhstan ranked as the 4th best
developing country for retail investments, scoring 56.5 out of 100.
Kazakhstan's market attracted large international retailers, such as French
retail chains Carrefour and Leroy Merlin, as well as food giants McDonald's
and KFC.

#### Tourism

arrivals in Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked
country in the world. Tourism is not a major component of the economy. As of
2014, tourism has accounted for 0.3% of Kazakhstan GDP, but the government had
plans to increase it to 3% by 2020.

According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness
Report 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan is $3.08 billion or
1.6 percent of total GDP. The WEF ranks Kazakhstan 81st in its 2017 report,
which is four positions higher compared to the previous period. Kazakhstan
received 6.5 million tourists in 2016.

#### Gambling

Gambling in Kazakhstan was developing already during the day of Czarist
Russia, then lotteries were organized. In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree
which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries
were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, which included Kazakhstan.

The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses
for gambling activity in 1999.

In 2007 the government of Kazakhstan has introduced a new law which ordered
banning gambling on the territory of Kazakhstan besides 2 places which were to
become the examples of Russia's special gambling zones. Casinos existing
outside these areas had to be closed or moved to places where they could
operate legally. The first legal casino opened after the introduction of new
law was Casino Flamingo in Kapchagay, which was opened on 1 October 2008.

In 2018, the income of gambling companies in Kazakhstan amounted to ₸19.5
billion. This is 16.1% more than in 2017. Then this amount was at the level of
₸16.8 billion.

#### Housing market

As of 2016, the total housing area in Kazakhstan was 342.6 million square
metres (3,688 million square feet), an average of 21.4 m2 (230 sq ft) per
person. The housing area per person increased by 20% in the period from 2005
to 2016, but remained below the UN's recommended standard of 30 square metres
(320 square feet) per person.

## External trade and investment

### Trade

Kazakh export destinations, 2013

Kazakhstan has 11 transcontinental routes, including rail and road routes, and
many oil and gas pipelines. The country's geographic position allows for the
transporting of goods from China to Europe three to four times faster than
other routes.

Sherin Suzhikova, Counselor of Kazakhstan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry
and Chao Yon-chuan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA), signed an agreement on 13 October 2006 in Taipei to improve
economic relations through "exchanges of market information and visits by
trade professionals." TAITRA has an office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

In 2006, North Dakota's then Lieutenant Governor Jack Dalrymple led an
18-member delegation of the North Dakota Trade Office representing seven North
Dakota companies and Dickinson State University on a trip to Kazakhstan,
Ukraine and Russia. North Dakota exports mostly machinery to Kazakhstan, the
eighth largest destination for North Dakotan exports; machinery exports
increased from US$22,000 to US$25 million between 2000 and 2005.

The percentage of high-tech exports (as a share of manufactured exports) from
Kazakhstan has grown from just 4.46% in 1995 to 37.17% in 2014. One of the
main factors that triggered this growth was the Technology Commercialization
Project developed and implemented by the World Bank Group and the Kazakh
Government. Through this project, 65 Kazakh tech startups received funding and
training helping them get their innovations into markets.

China is Kazakhstan's important trade partner. In late March 2015 the two
countries signed 33 deals worth US$23.6 billion. The deals cover different
industries, such as oil refining, cars, steel.

Kazakhstan's foreign trade turnover in 2018 comprised $93.5bn that is 19.7%
more compared to 2017. The volume of export in the reporting period made $67bn
(+25.7%) and import was $32.5bn (+9.9%).

The Government of Kazakhstan has been supporting Kazakhstani exporters
operating in foreign markets through their QazTrade incubator. Since September
2019, the program selects businesses and assists them with navigating
bureaucracy and connecting to foreign markets the government deems a priority,
including Germany, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and China.

### New economic reforms

In his state-of-the-nation address on September 1, 2023, President Kassym-
Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan unveiled a comprehensive plan focused on economic
reforms and the new economic course for the country. Among the key points were
industrialization, diversification, a move toward green energy, simplification
of tax codes, and a focus on transparency and fairness in governance.

Particular focus will be given to sectors like heavy engineering, uranium
enrichment, and automotive components, he noted. Tokayev proposed that in
order to support the manufacturing industry, foreign and domestic investors
should be exempted from paying taxes and other mandatory payments for the
first three years.

On fiscal matters, the President called for a coordination of financial and
monetary policies, with the aim of achieving stable economic growth of 6-7
percent. He also emphasized the need to attract foreign banks to boost
competition and solve the problem of insufficient corporate lending.

Tokayev further accentuated the need to support small and medium enterprises
and accelerate privatization. Changes in legislation will be initiated to
encourage consolidation among small businesses, and efforts will be
intensified to demonopolize key markets.

In his address, the President also focused on Kazakhstan’s commitment to
sustainability and environmental protection. Tokayev highlighted plans to
increase renewable energy capacity and develop hydrogen generation. The
President proposed to hold a national referendum on the construction of a
nuclear power plant.

The Kazakh leader also indicated a vision for Kazakhstan to become an IT-
focused country. He directed the government to increase the export of IT
services to one billion dollars by 2026. This will be facilitated by
partnerships with major foreign IT companies.

In the realm of transportation, President Tokayev outlined plans to establish
Kazakhstan as a major transit hub in Eurasia, focusing on key routes like the
Trans-Caspian and the international North-South Corridor. He noted that
Kazakhstan should eventually become a full-fledged transport and logistics
power. The President also pointed out that the realization of the transport
potential depends on Kazakhstan’s constructive and good-neighbourly relations
with all neighbouring countries, including Russia, China, and our neighbours
in Central and South Asia.

Kazakhstan is developing a national plan to provide projects with high-quality
infrastructure by 2029 and is introducing new financial incentive mechanisms
to facilitate investment flows into complex oil and gas projects.

### Bond market

In October 2014, Kazakhstan introduced its first overseas dollar bonds in 14
years. Kazakhstan issued $2.5 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds on 5 October
2014, in what was the nation's first dollar-denominated overseas sale since
2000. Kazakhstan sold $1.5 billion of 10-year dollar bonds to yield 1.5
percentage points above midswaps and $1 billion of 30-year debt at two
percentage points over midswaps. The country drew bids for $11 billion.

### Foreign direct investment

Kazakhstan is the largest recipient of total and annual foreign direct
investment of all CIS countries. The OECD has recognized the strides the
government has made in opening the country to international investment and in
improving the policy framework for investment as part of their efforts to
diversify the economy. In 2017 Kazakhstan was invited by OECD to become
Adherent to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational
Enterprises.

As of 30 September 2014, total foreign investment in Kazakhstan reached
US$211.5 billion. Of that total, net foreign Direct Investment constituted
US$129.3 billion, with portfolio and other investments comprising the
remaining US$82.2 billion.

The FDI growth in Kazakhstan was largely driven by increased investment in
mining, transport, financial services, telecommunication, and energy that
compensated for decreasing investment inflows in construction, metallurgy, and
trade. The Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov, has stated that
Kazakhstan aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDIs) worth around US$25
billion in 2023, adding that 46 projects involving international financial
investments were implemented in the country during 2022 in renewable energy,
metallurgy, agriculture, mining industry, and engineering. Kazakhstan's top-10
FDI donors in 2022 included the Netherlands, the Unitesd States, Switzerland,
Belgium, Russia, South Korea, China, France, the United Kingdom, and Turkey.

Kazakhstan established the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC),
modelled on the Dubai International Financial Center, in 2018. The AIFC offers
foreign investors an alternative jurisdiction for operations, with tax
holidays, flexible labor rules, a Common Law-based legal system, and
flexibility to carry out transactions in any currency. The Kazakh government
recommends that foreign investors use the AIFC for contracts with Kazakh
businesses.

Over the past five years, the major foreign investors in Kazakhstan have been
the Netherlands ($33.8 billion of investment), the United States ($19.4
billion), Switzerland ($12.5 billion), China ($ 6.2 billion) and France ($ 4.7
billion). Notably, almost 60% of the investment projects are related to non-
extractive sectors, including manufacturing, transportation, trade, as well as
financial and insurance services. Agriculture is one of Kazakhstan's most
important sectors where the country seeks to attract foreign investments to
boost the competitiveness of this sector of economy. To that end, in 2017
KazAgro negotiated with the European Investment Bank (EIB) a €200 million loan
for a period of 15 years.

13 Kazakhstan's regions out of 14 saw investment growth in 2020, despite the
COVID-19 pandemic. High growth of investment was in the construction sector,
specifically in Turkestan region and Zhambyl region as well as Shymkent city.
The gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in Kazakhstan reached $28
billion in 2022, a record-high in the past ten years. FDI inflow went up by
17.7 percent since 2021 when it reached $23.8 billion. In 2012, this figure
stood at $28.9 billion. The Atyrau Region received most of the investment –
$8.3 billion (a 48.3 percent increase), followed by Almaty city with $7.6
billion (10.9 percent), Astana – $2.2 billion (107.2 percent), the East
Kazakhstan Region – $2.2 billion (3.1 percent), and the Aktobe Region – $1.2
billion (11.2 percent down).

One of the main areas for investment is renewable energy, as Kazakhstan has
one of the largest solar and wind potentials in the region. Moreover, it has
abundant reserves, amounting to 90% of Central Asia's total, of critical raw
materials, which are essential for the deployment of technologies like wind
turbines (with rare earth magnets), batteries (lithium and cobalt) and
semiconductors (polysilicon). In November 2022, the EU had already recognised
Kazakhstan's value for the green transition by signing a strategic partnership
for the supply of critical raw materials, as well as green hydrogen.

### Investor support

Kazakhstan's investment environment is defined by the government's support for
foreign investors. To increase the FDI inflow, the country established the
Kazakh Invest National Company, or Kazakh Invest for short. It is a one-stop
shop for investors that facilitates investment projects' implementation
process from an idea to implementation, as well as ensures aftercare services.
In 2018, Kazakh Invest helped develop more than 70 investment proposals in a
variety of industries: metallurgy, petrochemistry, food industry, tourism and
other. It included creating a business plan, financial model and teaser
development.

Currently, Kazakh Invest is involved in 216 investment projects and
initiatives worth $42.5 billion that will create around 47,000 jobs. This
year, 4 investment projects worth $217 million have been launched with the
support of the organization, while 85 projects worth $12.3 billion are being
implemented.

In order to facilitate foreign investment, Kazakhstan launched in 2020 an
online portal elicense.kz, which allows to conclude investment contracts
online reducing red tape. The first agreement that was concluded via the
portal was between Kaz Solar 50 and the German company Solarnet Investment
GmbH for a renewable energy project worth ₸5 billion.

To make Kazakhstan more attractive to foreign investors, Kazakhstan
established 14 special economic zones. Companies located in these zones
receive preferential treatment, including exemptions from corporate income
tax, land tax, property tax, VAT and customs duties for up to 25 years,

### Intellectual property

In 2015 Kazakhstan passed a law to regulate Intellectual Property, patent law,
and copyright protections and bring its legislation into line with the
European Patent Convention (1994 revision) and the 2006 Singapore Treaty.

### United Arab Emirates

In April 2025, Al Khaleej Sugar, a leading sugar company from the United Arab
Emirates, announced plans to establish a sugar plant in Kazakhstan’s Almaty
Region. The decision was made following a meeting on 27 April between the
company’s managing director, Sheikh Jamal Al Ghurair, and the region’s
governor, Marat Sultangaziyev. The plant’s location was to be near the city of
Konayev, chosen for its logistical advantages. Key considerations for the
project included securing a reliable water supply, with alternative irrigation
sources being explored, as well as the potential development of wind power
plants to ensure the plant’s energy self-sufficiency. Al Khaleej Sugar aimed
to minimize environmental impact by relying on renewable energy. The company,
which controlled 3% of the global refined sugar market, conducted a detailed
hydrological analysis to ensure the success of the project.

## Public policy

### 2015 "Nurly Zhol" economic policy

On 11 November 2014 in his address to the nation for 2015, Nazarbayev
proclaimed Kazakhstan's New Economic Policy – The Path to the Future (Nurly
Zhol). The new economic policy implies large-scale state investment in
infrastructure over the next several years. In the short term, the program
"Nurly Zhol" will apply the anti-crisis measures to overcome the turbulence in
the global economy. The long-term measures of the state program of
infrastructure development will help to create a strong platform for new
growth.

Kazakhstan has identified five priorities for modernization of the state and
the economy to maintain competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Kazakhstan was ranked 36th in the Ease of Doing Business report released by
the World Bank Group in 2018. The report's rankings rate ease of regulations
for businesses and strength of property rights.

The Heritage Foundation, a Washington, D.C.–based research center, ranked
Kazakhstan 41st in its Index of Economic Freedom 2018\. Its overall score has
increased by 0.1 point, still being only "moderately free" with significant
improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep
declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom.

Kazakhstan aimed in 2017 to boost its economy by attracting private investors
interested in developing national companies. This is the main goal of
privatization that is expected to decrease the share of public property to 15%
of GDP. Such companies as Kazakhstan Railways, Samruk-Energo, Kazatomprom,
Kaspost, KazMunayGas and Air Astana are expected to be sold through IPO.

Kazakhstan fell from 32nd to the 38th place in the 2018 IMD World
Competitiveness ranking. The report evaluates business efficiency, public
finance and domestic economy.

### Privatisation 2016–2020

In December 2015, Kazakhstan Government approved new privatization plan for
2016 – 2020. It is a large-scale privatization program that continues the
privatization of 2014 and includes 60 major state-owned companies. According
to Kazakh Finance ministry, the state budget got ₸6.99 billion (US$20.6
million) from the deals reached within the 2014–2016 privatization program as
of 20 Sept. 2016. Kazakhstan's privatization program aims to reduce the state
participation in the economy to 15 percent, which is the level set for
countries of the OECD.

According to the Kazakh Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov, the implementation of
a large-scale privatization plan will reduce the share of state participation
in the economy down to 14 percent by 2025.

The privatization list includes 675 facilities in the public and quasi-public
sectors, including the shares of 262 national companies that are part of
holdings such as the Samruk Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund, KazMunayGas, and
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy.

According to Minister of National Economy Alibek Kuantyrov, the plan excludes
200 critical social life support systems such as water, power, and heat
facilities. These objects will remain under state ownership.

### Special Economic Zones

A Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a part of Kazakhstan's territory, which has a
special legal regime, with all the necessary infrastructure, to carry out
priority activities.

Kazakhstan has 14 SEZs with different industry orientations in 12 regions
nationwide, particularly in the Khorgos-Eastern Gate logistics hub, Turkistan,
a center of international tourism and pilgrimage, and the Aktau Seaport, which
has incorporated the ports of Aktau and Kuryk in the summer of 2023.

In March 2023, Kazakhstan created the G4 City special economic zone in the
Almaty Region, seeking to attract nearly 3.7 trillion tenge ($8.1 billion) of
investments through 2048. The new economic zone with an area of 30,000
hectares is expected to provide favorable conditions for attracting domestic
and foreign investment to create an integrated G4 City, which will facilitate
the development of the entire region.

Currently, the following SEZs have been established in Kazakhstan:

  1. 'Astana, the New City' in Nur-Sultan (the expiry date is in 2027).
  2. 'Aktau Sea Port' in Aktau (the expiry date is on 1 January 2028).
  3. 'Ontustik' in Sairam district of South-Kazakhstan region (the expiry date is on 1 July 2030).
  4. 'National Industrial Petrochemical Park' in Atyrau region (the expiry date is on 31 December 2032)
  5. 'Park of Innovative Technologies' (the expiry date is 1 January 2028).
  6. ‘Saryarka’ in Karaganda region (the expiry date is 1 December 2036).
  7. ‘Horgos - the eastern gates’ in Almaty region (the expiry date is 2035).
  8. ‘Pavlodar’ in Pavlodar (the expiry date is 1 December 2036).
  9. ’Chemical Park Taraz’ in Taraz (the expiry date is 1 January 2037).
  10. ‘International Center for Cross-Border Cooperation Horgos' in Almaty region (the expiry date is 1 January 2041).
  11. 'Turkestan' in Turkestan region (the expiry date is 1 January 2043).

### Small and medium-sized enterprises

A new program to support small businesses was launched in Kazakhstan in
February 2015. 2015 is expected to be a pilot period of the program. During
that period the initiative will be focused on three major areas, notably
agribusiness, machinery building and production of construction materials, and
is to be further extended to other industries.

In May 2015 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed
to provide €41 million for technical cooperation projects, advisory support to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to introduce a Women in
Business program.

In 2016 the number of Kazakhstan's telecom start-ups increased by 10% compared
to 2015. Around 9,400 small telecom companies are currently registered in the
country.

The Kazakh Government provides extensive support to businesses, especially
SMEs. The share of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in the country's
gross domestic product grew by 7.9 percent between 2015 and 2021 and reached
34.7 percent. Kazakhstan plans to raise this indicator to 50% by 2050.

In 2023, it was reported that the number of small and medium-sized businesses
(SMEs) in Kazakhstan has increased by 23.4% to nearly two million. The number
of people working in SMEs increased by more than 18% to 4.1 million,
accounting for around 40% of everyone employed in the economy.

The share of SMEs in the economy grew from 33.3% to 36.5%, while the volume of
output by SMEs increased by 28% to over 59 trillion tenge ($132.4 billion).

To expand SMEs’ access to finance, a number of programmes are in place in the
country to provide concessional lending and microfinance, subsidised interest
rates, loan guarantees and grants to start a business. The main operator of
financial support programmes for SMEs is the Damu Entrepreneurship Development
Fund.

**Government programme for business support and business development “Business
Roadmap 2025”**

“BRM 2025” programme has been in operation since 2010 and is administered by
the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Initially, the
focus of the programme was on supporting enterprises in non-extracting and
import-substituting sectors. Over time, this was expanded to rural areas,
small and single-industry towns’ entrepreneurs, who are not subject to
sectoral restrictions. The programme implementation involves both central and
local authorities, Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund, Atameken National
Chamber of Entrepreneurs and commercial banks. The types of support that the
programme offers include interest rate subsidies, loan guarantees, grants,
training and consulting assistance; and meets the basic needs of
entrepreneurs, making “BRM 2025” the most popular government programme.

**The programmes of Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund**

Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund implements a number of its own
programmes, which are financed from the company’s own capital or by raising
funds from local authorities and international financial organisations. Within
the framework of regional programmes, loans are granted at a rate of up to
8.0% in priority sectors, which are determined depending on the specifics of
the economy of each region. Within the framework of international programmes,
loans are issued on market terms and without sector restrictions.

In terms of its own programmes, Damu Fund and its partner organisations
(banks, leasing companies, microfinance organisations) have financed more than
55 112 projects for KZT 837 756 million as of the end of 2020.

In May 2023, Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov said medium-sized businesses
should become the engine of progress that drives Kazakhstan’s manufacturing
growth with the launch of competitive products and a wide range of services.
To enhance the protection of the rights of entrepreneurs, the government is
introducing a regulation-from-scratch mechanism to drop 10,000 unwarranted
requirements for businesses and automate processes in all areas of state
control.

## Recent miscellany

Kazakhstan was ranked 54th 2017 Economic Freedom of the World report published
by Fraser Institute, but ranks 12 places below on place 66 when adjusted by
the Gender Disparity Index, which captures the degree to which women around
the world have the same legal rights as men and adjusts the economic freedom
score accordingly. This shows a large disadvantage of women in business.

In recent years a trade route has been established between Kazakhstan and the
United States. It now makes up 54% of the World's salt imports and exports by
volume (350,000 tonnes per year).[_clarification needed_]

In 2021, 14 products developed by Kazakh scientists began being exported to
China, Russia, Turkey, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and the Czech Republic. These
products include, but are not limited to, food & drinks based on milk whey;
probiotics; an anti-fungal drug; biological sanitation products.

In 2021, it was reported that the number of young female entrepreneurs in
Kazakhstan has increased by 15 percent.

### Global tariff war

On 11 April 2025, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stated that Kazakhstan was
prepared to face the ongoing global economic crisis, which he described as one
of the most severe in recent decades. He cited disruptions in global trade and
production chains, price volatility, and intensified competition for
investment as key challenges. Despite these pressures, Tokayev affirmed that
Kazakhstan would maintain its development agenda and continue funding priority
infrastructure projects. The statement followed a government meeting
addressing falling global prices for energy and commodities. At the time, the
economy had seen a temporary boost from rising export demand and the
suspension of certain U.S. tariffs.
