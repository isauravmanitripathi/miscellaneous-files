The **economy of Poland** is an emerging and developing, high-income,
industrialized mixed economy that serves as the sixth-largest in the European
Union by nominal GDP and fifth-largest by GDP (PPP). Poland boasts the
extensive public services characteristic of most developed economies and is
one of few countries in Europe to provide no tuition fees for undergraduate
and postgraduate education and with universal public healthcare that is free
at a point of use. Since 1988, Poland has pursued a policy of economic
liberalisation but retained an advanced public welfare system. It ranks 19th
worldwide in terms of GDP (PPP), 20th in terms of GDP (nominal), and 21st in
the 2023 Economic Complexity Index. Among OECD nations, Poland has a highly
efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at
roughly 22.7% of GDP.

The largest component of Poland's economy is the service sector (62.3%),
followed by industry (34.2%) and agriculture (3.5%). Following the economic
reform of 1989, Poland's external debt has increased from $42.2 billion in
1989 to $365.2 billion in 2014. Poland shipped US$224.6 billion worth of goods
around the globe in 2017, while exports increased to US$221.4 billion. The
country's top export goods include machinery, electronic equipment, vehicles,
furniture, and plastics. Poland was the only economy in the EU to avoid a
recession during the 2008 financial crisis.

As of 2019, the Polish economy had been growing steadily for 28 years, a
record high in the EU. This record was only surpassed by Australia in the
world economy. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity has grown on average
by 6% p.a. over the last 20 years, the highest in Central Europe. Poland's GDP
has increased seven-fold since 1990. Poland's nominal GDP has increased by
500% since 2000.

## History

Poland has seen the largest increase in GDP per capita (more than 100%) both
among the former Eastern Bloc countries, and compared to the EU-15 (around
45%). It has had uninterrupted economic growth since 1992, even after the 2008
financial crisis.

### Before 1989

This article discusses the economy of post-1989 Poland. For a historical
overview see:

  * Economy of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)
  * Economy of the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939)
  * Economy of the People's Republic of Poland (1945–1989)

### 1990–2009

The Polish state steadfastly pursued a policy of economic liberalization
throughout the 1990s, with positive results for economic growth but negative
results for some sectors of the population. The privatization of small and
medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms has
encouraged the development of the private business sector, which has been the
main drive for Poland's economic growth. The agricultural sector remained
constrained by structural problems, surplus labour, inefficient small farms,
and a lack of investment. Restructuring and privatization of "sensitive
sectors" (e.g. coal), has also been slow, but foreign investments in energy
and steel have begun to turn the tide. Also, reforms in healthcare, education,
the pension system, and state administration have resulted in larger than
expected fiscal pressures. Improving this account deficit and tightening
monetary policy, with a focus on inflation, are priorities for the Polish
government. Further progress in public finance depends mainly on the reduction
of public sector employment, and an overhaul of the tax code to incorporate
farmers, who currently pay significantly lower taxes than other people with
similar income levels.

### 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession

Since the Great Recession, Poland's GDP has continued to grow. In 2009, the
GDP for the European Union as a whole dropped by 4.5% while Polish GDP
increased by 1.6%. As of November 2013, the size of the EU's economy remains
below the pre-crisis level, while Poland's economy increased by a cumulative
16%. The major reasons for its success appear to be a large internal market
(in terms of population it is sixth in the EU) and a business-friendly
political climate. The economic reforms implemented after the fall of
communism in the 1990s have also played a role; between 1989 and 2007 Poland's
economy grew by 177%, faster than other countries in Eastern and Central
Europe, while at the same time millions were left without work.

However, the economic fluctuations of the business cycle did affect Poland's
unemployment rate, which by early 2013 reached almost 11%. This level was
still below European average and has begun falling subsequently. As of October
2017, Poland's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% according to Eurostat.

## Economic growth

In the period from 1989 to 2018, Poland's GDP increased by 826.96% and it was
the best result in Europe. In the same period, Ireland's GDP grew by 789.43%,
Slovakia's by 783.83% and the Czech Republic by 549.47%. In 1990, the Polish
national income amounted to USD 65.978 billion, and by 2017 it had increased
to USD 524.5 billion. Achieving these results was possible thanks to the
privatisation of state-owned enterprises, the development of private
entrepreneurship, but also the rapid increase in work efficiency and openness
to foreign direct investments. In 2018, the Polish economy grew by 5.1%
compared to 4.8% in 2017. Economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 in
Poland amounted to 4.9% on an annual basis and compared to the third quarter,
where GDP increased by 5.1%, it was slightly lower. During this period,
investments increased by 6.7%, private consumption also increased by 4.3%, and
domestic demand increased by 4.8%. The PMI index in January 2019 was 48.2
points and was higher than in December 2018 when it amounted to 47.6 points.

## Labour market and wages

Unemployment in Poland became a major problem after the Revolutions of 1989,
which collapsed communism in Poland, although the economy previously had high
levels of hidden unemployment.[_citation needed_] The unemployment rate then
fell to 10% by the late 1990s and then increased again in the first few years
of the 21st century, reaching a peak of 20% in 2002. It has since decreased,
although unevenly. Since 2008 the unemployment rate in Poland has consistently
been below European average.

The rate fell below 8% in 2015 and 3.2% in 2019 leading to a labour deficit.

## Foreign trade and FDI

With the collapse of the ruble-based COMECON trade bloc in 1991, Poland
reoriented its trade. As early as 1996, 70% of its trade was with EU members.
Neighbouring Germany is Poland's main trading partner today. Poland joined the
European Union in May 2004. Before that, it fostered regional integration and
trade through the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which
included Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Poland is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. As a member of
the European Union, it applies the common external tariff to goods from other
countries including the United States. Poland's major imports are capital
goods needed for industrial retooling and for manufacturing inputs. The
country's exports also include machinery but are highly diversified. The most
successful exports are furniture, foods, motor boats, light planes, hardwood
products, casual clothing, shoes, and cosmetics. Germany is by far the biggest
importer of Poland's exports as of 2013. In the agricultural sector, the
biggest money-makers abroad include smoked and fresh fish, fine chocolate,
dairy products, meats, and specialty breads, with the exchange rate conducive
to export growth. Food exports amounted to 62 billion złoty in 2011,
increasing by 17% from 2010. Most Polish exports to the U.S. receive tariff
benefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) program. Poland
ranks in the top 20 in the world both in terms of exports and imports,
recording a clear trade surplus.

Poland is less dependent on external trade than most other Central and Eastern
European countries, but its volume of trade with Europe is still substantial.
In 2011 the volume of trade (exports plus imports) with the Eurozone as share
of GDP was 40%, a doubling from the mid 1990s. 30% of Poland's exports are to
Germany and another 30% to the rest of Europe. There has been substantial
increase in Poland's exports to Russia. However, in August 2014, exports of
fruits and vegetables to Russia fell dramatically following its politically
motivated ban by Moscow.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) was at 40% of GDP in 2010, a doubling over the
level in 2000. Most FDI into Poland comes from France, Germany, and the
Netherlands. Polish firms in turn have foreign investments primarily in Italy
and Luxembourg. Most of the internal FDI is in manufacturing, which makes it
susceptible to economic fluctuations in the source countries.

The UAE is Poland's largest trading partner in the Arab world.

The government offers investors various forms of state aid, such as CIT tax at
the level of 19% and investment incentives in 14 Special Economic Zones (among
others: income tax exemption, real estate tax exemption, competitive land
prices), several industrial and technology parks, the possibility to benefit
from the EU structural funds, brownfield and greenfield locations. According
to the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the level of FDI inflow into Poland in
2006 amounted to €13.9 billion.

According to an Ernst & Young report, Poland ranks 7th in the world in terms
of investment attractiveness. However, Ernst & Young's 2010 European
attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job
creation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008. According to
an OECD report, in 2004 Poland was one of the hardest-working nations in
Europe. In 2010, the World Economic Forum ranked Poland near the bottom of
OECD countries in terms of the clarity, efficiency, and neutrality of the
legal framework used by firms to settle disputes.

## Sectors

As of 2024[update], the Polish economy is dominated by the services sector,
with 615,647 registered companies, followed by 329,255 companies in finance,
insurance, and real estate and 176,149 companies in retail trade.

Before World War II, Poland's industrial base was concentrated in the coal,
textile, chemical, machinery, iron, and steel sectors. Today it extends to
fertilizers, petrochemicals, machine tools, electrical machinery, electronics,
car manufacturing, and shipbuilding.

Poland's industrial base suffered greatly during World War II, and many
resources were directed toward reconstruction. The socialist economic system
imposed in the late 1940s created large and unwieldy economic structures
operated under a tight central command. In part because of this systemic
rigidity, the economy performed poorly even in comparison with other economies
in Central Europe.

In 1990, the Tadeusz Mazowiecki government began a comprehensive reform
programme to replace the centralised command economy with a market-oriented
system. While the results overall have been impressive, many large state-owned
industrial enterprises, particularly the rail, mining, steel, and defence
sectors, have remained resistant to change and the downsizing required to
survive in a market-based economy.

#### Energy

#### Pharmaceuticals

The pharmaceutical market is worth 50 billion PLN as of 2023[update], an
increase of 9.5% over the previous year.

The non-prescription medicine market, which accounts for about one-third of
the total market value, was worth PLN 7.5bn in 2008. This value includes drugs
and non-drugs such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, dressings, dental
materials, diagnostic tests, and medical devices. The prescription medicines
market was worth PLN 15.8bn.

### Mining

As of 2023[update], the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of
rhenium, 5th largest producer of silver, the 13th largest producer of copper,
the 14th largest producer of sulfur,and the 14th largest producer of salt.

### Agriculture

Agriculture employs 8.2% of the workforce but contributes 3.8% to GDP,
reflecting relatively low productivity. Unlike the industrial sector, Poland's
agricultural sector remained largely in private hands during the Polish
People's Republic. Most of the former state farms are now leased to farmer
tenants. Lack of credit is hampering efforts to sell former state farmland.
Currently, Poland's 2 million private farms occupy 90% of all farmland and
account for roughly the same percentage of total agricultural production.
Farms are small—8 hectares on average—and often fragmented. Farms with an area
exceeding 15 ha accounted for 9% of the total number of farms but cover 45% of
total agricultural area. Over half of all farm households in Poland produce
only for their own needs with little, if any, commercial sales.

Poland is a net exporter of processed fruit and vegetables, meat, and dairy
products. Processors often rely on imports to supplement domestic supplies of
wheat, feed grains, vegetable oil, and protein meals, which are generally
insufficient to meet domestic demand. However, Poland is the leading EU
producer of potatoes and rye and is one of the world's largest producers of
sugar beets and triticale. Poland is also a significant producer of rapeseed,
grains, hogs, and cattle. Poland is the sixth-largest producer and exporter of
apples in the entire world.

### Tourism

After acceding to the EU in 2004, tourism grew in Poland. Most tourist
attractions in Poland are connected with natural environment, historic sites,
and cultural events. They draw millions of tourists every year from all around
the world. According to Tourist Institute's data, Poland was visited by 15.7
million tourists in 2006, and by 15 million tourists in 2007, out of the total
number of 66.2 million foreign visitors. In 2016 the number of arrivals to
Poland amounted to 80.5 million. 17.5 million of this number are arrivals
considered for tourism purposes (with at least one night's stay), making it
the 16th most visited country in the world. The most popular cities are
Kraków, Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Łódź, Poznań, Szczecin, Lublin, Toruń, Sopot,
Zakopane, and the Wieliczka Salt Mine. The best recreational destinations
include Poland's Masurian Lake District, Baltic Sea coast, Tatra Mountains
(the highest mountain range of the Carpathians), Sudetes, and Białowieża
Forest. Poland's main tourist offers consist of sightseeing within cities and
out-of-town historical monuments, business trips, qualified tourism,
agrotourism, mountain hiking (trekking), and climbing among others.

### Financial sector

The Polish banking sector is regulated by the Polish Financial Supervision
Authority (PFSA).

While transforming the country to a market-oriented economy during 1992–97,
the government privatized some banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced
legal reforms that made the sector competitive. These reforms, and the health
and relative stability of the sector, attracted a number of strategic foreign
investors. At the beginning of 2009, Poland's banking sector had 51 domestic
banks, a network of 578 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned
banks. In addition, foreign investors had controlling stakes in nearly 40
commercial banks, which made up 68% of the banking capital. Banks in Poland
reacted to the 2008 financial crisis by restraining lending, raising interest
rates, and strengthening balance sheets. Subsequently, the sector started
lending again, with an increase of more than 4% expected in 2011.

### Venture capital

The segment of the private equity market that finances early-stage high-risk
companies, with the potential for fast growth, had 130 active firms in Poland
(as of March 2019). Between 2009 and 2019, these entities have invested
locally in over 750 companies, an average of 9 companies per portfolio. Since
2016, new legal institutions have been established for entities investing in
enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds
invested €178 million in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). As of March 2019,
total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at €2.6
billion. The total value of investments of the Polish VC market is €209.2
million.

### Transportation

Poland is served by an extensive network of railways. In most cities, the main
railway station is located near a city centre and is well connected to the
local transportation system. The infrastructure is operated by Polish State
Railways, part of state-run PKP Group. The rail network is very dense in
western and northern Poland, while the eastern part of the country is less
developed. The capital city, Warsaw, has the country's only rapid transit
system: the Warsaw Metro.

Poland's busiest airport is Warsaw Chopin Airport. Warsaw Chopin serves as the
main international hub for Poland's flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines. In
addition to Warsaw Chopin, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, and Poznań all
have international airports. In preparation for the Euro 2012 football
championships jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, a number of airports
around the country were renovated and redeveloped. This included the building
of new terminals with an increased number of jetways and stands at both
Wrocław Airport in Wrocław and Lech Wałęsa Airport in Gdańsk.

Poland has 412,264 km (256,170 mi) of public roads. Polish public roads are
categorised by administrative division, which include national roads,
voivodeship roads, Powiat roads, and Gmina roads. Motorways and expressways
are part of the national road network. As of May 2025, there are 5,205.5 km of
motorways and expressways in use.

## Location

Poland has an excellent location for transporting locally made components or
products to the rest of Europe. For example, when moving production from
China, the new factory in Poland can move their goods in 24 hours to the most
populated parts of Europe, and in 48 hours to all of Europe.

## Potential of the Polish economy in the EU

Poland, measured by the purchasing power parity index, is the sixth-largest
economy in the European Union and the eighth-largest economy in Europe,
slightly ahead of the Netherlands.

Poland recorded GDP growth even during the 2008 financial crisis. The
unemployment rate in the country remains very low and amounted to 5% in
September 2023.

Although the Polish economy is catching up with Western European countries,
this has been a slow process. So far, taking into account the level of social
development[_clarification needed_], Poland has managed to overtake Portugal.
There is a great deal of variation between regions. Masovian Voivodeship is on
a similar level to the richest regions of Spain and most regions of France
(82% of the EU average). However, it should be remembered that the GDP of this
voivodeship is mainly generated by Warsaw. Lower Silesian Voivodeship with a
GDP of $16,000 is on par with Portugal and the regions of Spain and Greece.
Subsequent voivodeships reached about 50% of the EU average, and the poorest
voivodships of the eastern wall have GDP per capita comparable to Romania and
Bulgaria.

Polish capital has several large concerns in this region of Europe, i.e. PKN
Orlen, which has its stations in Germany and Lithuania, Polsat, which also
invests in Lithuania, the ITI Group. Poland has a highly developed road
network, most of the A1, A2, A4 highways and expressways, including S6 and S7,
are fully completed. The next ones are to be ready by 2023. Their construction
by private companies is financed in part by the EU. In the coming years,
Poland is to receive approximately EUR 4.5 billion for the modernisation of
railways.

Poland is one of the key immigration destinations in the EU, having attracted
more non-EU immigrants, already in 2021 mostly from Ukraine, than any other EU
country for a few consecutive years.
