The economy of Pakistan is categorized as a developing economy. It ranks as
the 26th-largest based on GDP using purchasing power parity (PPP) and the 44th
largest in terms of nominal GDP. With a population of 254.4 million people as
of 2024, Pakistan's position at per capita income ranks 160th by GDP (nominal)
and 141st by GDP (PPP) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In its early years, Pakistan's economy relied heavily on private industries.
The nationalization of a significant portion of the sector, including
financial services, manufacturing, and transportation, began in the early
1970s under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. During Zia-ul Haq's regime in the 1980s, an
"Islamic" economy was adopted, outlawing economic practices forbidden in
Sharīʿah and mandating traditional religious practices. The economy started
privatizing again in the 1990s.

The economic growth centers in Pakistan are located along the Indus River;
these include the diversified economies of Karachi and major urban centers in
Punjab (such as Faisalabad, Lahore, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, and Gujranwala),
alongside less developed areas in other parts of the country. In recent
decades, regional connectivity initiatives such as the China-Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) have emerged as pivotal contributors to infrastructure and
energy development, with long-term implications for economic stability.
Pakistan was classified as a semi-industrial economy for the first time in the
late 1990s, albeit an underdeveloped country with a heavy dependence on
agriculture, particularly the textile industry relying on cotton production.
Primary export commodities include textiles, leather goods, sports equipment,
chemicals, and carpets/rugs.

Pakistan is presently undergoing economic liberalization, including the
privatization of all government corporations, aimed at attracting foreign
investment and reducing budget deficits. However, the country continues to
grapple with challenges such as rapid population growth, widespread
illiteracy, political instability, hostile neighbors and heavy foreign debt.

## Economic history

### Inception

In the late 1940s, upon its establishment, Pakistan had an agrarian-based
economy. Agriculture constituted 53% of the country's GDP in 1947 and slightly
increased to 53.2% in 1949–50. With a population of approximately 30 million,
including around 6 million residing in urban areas, about 65% of the labor
force was engaged in agriculture. The agricultural sector played a crucial
role, contributing to 99.2% of exports and making up nearly 90% of foreign
exchange earnings.

Despite possessing significant land and mineral resources in both East and
West Pakistan, including natural gas, crude oil, coal, limestone, and marble,
Pakistan faced numerous challenges. In 1950, its per capita income was around
$360 (in 1985 international dollars), and the literacy rate was only 10%. The
nation encountered a lack of economic infrastructure, financial resources, and
an industrial foundation, particularly with poverty rates ranging from 55% to
60% in the West Pakistan region.

Due to limited capital in the small private sector, the government opted to
focus on the public sector to foster economic and industrial development. In
the fiscal year 1949–50, Pakistan recorded a national savings rate of 2%, a
foreign savings rate of 2%, and an investment rate of 4%. Manufacturing
contributed 7.8% to the GDP, while services, trade, and other sectors
accounted for a significant 39%, reflecting a policy centered around import-
substituting industrialization. The trade balance of payments indicated a
deficit of 66 million rupees (Rs) during the period spanning 1949/50 to
1950/51.

### 1950s

The 1950s marked the initiation of planned development in Pakistan, with the
introduction of the Colombo Plan in 1951 leading to a series of Five-Year
Plans from 1955 to 1998. Concurrently, a Ten-Year Perspective Plan was
implemented, complemented by a rolling Three-Year Development Plan.

During the 1950s, Pakistan pursued a policy of import-substituting
industrialization. Notably, the Korean War (1950–1953) brought substantial
merchant profits to Pakistan's public and emerging private sectors, fueling
industrialization.

In 1952, Pakistan imposed bans on the imports of cotton textiles and luxury
goods, followed by comprehensive import regulations in 1953, propelling the
country into the ranks of the fastest-growing nations. However, biased
policies against agriculture and unfavorable trade terms between agriculture
and industry led to a decline in the annual growth rate of agriculture.

By the late 1950s, Pakistan achieved self-sufficiency in cotton textiles,
emphasizing export development. The influx of US military and economic aid
amounting to US$500 million during 1955–58 contributed to Pakistan's growth
reliant on foreign aid.

In 1959, after a military coup d'état in 1958, the martial law regime
introduced export bonus vouchers as import licenses and exempted certain goods
from licensing. During this period, Pakistan faced a worsening trade balance,
with deficits increasing from −831 million Rupees in 1950/51 to −1043 million
rupees in 1959/60.

Economically, agriculture grew at an annual rate of 1.6%, while manufacturing
expanded impressively at 7.7% per annum during the 1950s. In the fiscal year
1959–60, the Per Capita Gross National Product (GNP) stood at Rs. 355 in West
Pakistan and Rs. 269 in East Pakistan, indicating a growing economic disparity
between the two regions.

### 1960s

In the 1960s, amid a substantial influx of American aid, Pakistan enjoyed
political stability, fostering robust economic growth. Poverty, measured by
the poverty headcount ratio, fluctuated from nearly 50% in the early 1960s to
54% in 1963–64.

During the 1960s, Pakistan achieved an impressive annual agricultural growth
rate of 5%, driven by substantial investments in water resources, increased
farmer incentives, mechanization, greater use of fertilizers and pesticides,
and expanded cultivation of high-yielding rice and wheat varieties in the
Green Revolution.

Large-scale manufacturing experienced significant growth, expanding at a
remarkable rate of 16% per annum from 1960/61 to 1964/65, fueled by protective
measures for domestic industries, including export subsidies.

However, the Pakistan-India War of 1965 led to reduced foreign economic
assistance, impacting the growth rate of large-scale manufacturing. From
1965–70, this sector grew at a comparatively lower rate of 10% per annum.

Despite challenges, Pakistan achieved an impressive average annual GDP growth
rate of 6.7% throughout the 1960s. In the fiscal year 1969–70, the poverty
incidence rate decreased to 46%. Per Capita GNP was Rs. 504 in West Pakistan
and Rs. 314 in East Pakistan, indicating a widening regional economic
disparity.

### 1970s

The economic landscape in the early 1970s witnessed growing disparities
between East and West Pakistan, leading to East Pakistan's declaration of
independence and the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Subsequently, Pakistan
underwent notable transformations in both its political and economic spheres.

Under martial law authorities, amidst challenging macroeconomic conditions,
the socialist Pakistan People's Party gained empowerment. This period grappled
with numerous economic challenges, including a surge in poverty incidence to
55% during 1971–72. Pakistan also confronted heightened import costs due to
the global oil price shock in October 1973, a severe global recession from
1974 to 1977, cotton sector failures in 1974–75, pest infestations affecting
crops, and massive floods in 1973, 1974, and 1976–77.

One significant economic issue during this time was high inflation, with
prices increasing by an average of 15% per annum between 1972 and 1977. The
fiscal deficit/GDP ratio averaged 8.1% during 1973–77, indicating substantial
fiscal challenges. Trade imbalances were apparent, with trade deficits rising
from US$337 million in 1970–71 to US$1,184 million in 1976–77.

The military coup d'état of 1977, leading to the establishment of a martial
law regime that initiated denationalization, deregulation, and privatization
policies. Agriculture experienced modest growth at a rate of 2.4% per annum,
while large-scale manufacturing expanded at a rate of 5.5% per annum during
the 1970s.

Large and medium-scale private manufacturing played a significant role,
contributing 75% of the total value-added and investment in manufacturing
during the 1970s. The remaining 25% of value-added came from small-scale
manufacturing.

Overall, this period was marked by significant political and economic changes,
driven by challenges posed by economic disparities, political shifts, and
efforts to address issues such as inflation, fiscal deficits, and trade
imbalances.

### 1980s

The 1980s brought substantial changes to Pakistan's economic landscape, moving
away from the nationalization policies of the 1970s and fostering private
sector industrial investment, which greatly contributed to robust economic
growth. Notable developments in this era included a drop in the poverty
headcount ratio to 29.1% in 1986–87, showcasing a decline in poverty
incidence. The unemployment rate exhibited a positive trend, decreasing from
3.7% in 1980 to 2.6% in 1990.

Between 1985 and 1988, the government endeavored to implement an Islamic
interest-free banking system, introducing business partnerships based on
profit and loss sharing. The national savings/GDP ratio reached a notable 16%
in 1986–87, largely due to significant worker remittances from the Middle
East. Despite this growth, challenges emerged, including negative public
savings and a declining public investment/GDP ratio throughout the 1980s.

To address increasing budget deficits in the early 1980s, the government
heavily relied on non-bank domestic borrowing, resulting in substantial
domestic debt growth. Consequently, the public debt/GDP ratio surged to 77.1%
in 1988, 81.9% in 1989, and 82.6% in 1990, leading to significant interest
payments and persistent fiscal deficits.

In 1985, democracy was restored in Pakistan, marking a pivotal political
development. The country experienced a commendable average annual GDP growth
rate of 6.3% between 1980 and 1990. The 1980s saw a surge in manufacturing
exports, with an annual large-scale manufacturing growth rate of 8.8%, and
solid growth in agriculture, with an annual agricultural growth rate of 5.4%.

These highlights underscore a transformative and recovering economic period in
the 1980s, characterized by a shift in economic policies, improved fiscal
performance, and substantial progress in poverty reduction and employment. The
era also witnessed efforts to align financial practices with Islamic
principles and significant economic growth in the manufacturing and
agricultural sectors.

### 1990s

The 1990s posed a formidable economic landscape for Pakistan, marked by a
series of challenges and developments. Declining worker remittances and
escalating external deficits set the tone for economic strains.
Simultaneously, the decade witnessed the second-worst inflation in Pakistan's
history, driven by diminishing GDP growth rates. Unemployment surged, reaching
5.9% in 1991 and escalating further to 7.2% in 2000.

Pakistan's external debt tripled, soaring to US$30 billion by 1995. The
external debt/GDP ratio rose from 42% to 50%, accompanied by increases in the
external debt/exports ratio (from 209% to 258%) and the debt service ratio
(from 18% to 27%). A deteriorating external debt profile led to a rise in
domestic debt, reaching Rs. 909 billion, and a domestic debt/GDP ratio of 42%.

The late 1990s witnessed a severe debt crisis, with the public debt/GDP ratio
skyrocketing from 57.5% in 1975–77 to 102% in 1998–99. The public
debt/revenues ratio surged to 624%, and the interest payments/revenues ratio
reached 42.6%, rendering Pakistan's public debt unsustainable. Concerns over
external debt default emerged in 1996 and 1998, triggered by Western economic
sanctions in response to Pakistan's nuclear tests in May 1998, causing massive
capital flight.

Despite these challenges, Pakistan managed to sustain an agricultural growth
rate of 4.4% per annum and a large-scale manufacturing growth rate of 4.8% per
annum throughout the 1990s. However, the era witnessed a significant increase
in poverty incidence, reaching 30.6% in 1998–99. The decade encapsulated a
complex economic narrative, as Pakistan navigated external debt burdens,
fiscal imbalances, inflation, and rising unemployment. Amid these
difficulties, there were positive aspects, including growth in key sectors
like agriculture and manufacturing. Nonetheless, the 1990s also brought forth
a looming threat of debt default, magnified by economic sanctions in response
to nuclear tests.

### 2000s

The 2000s witnessed a period of substantial economic challenges and
transformations for Pakistan. The impact of high public debt gained
prominence, identified by the official Debt Reduction and Management Committee
in 2001, contributing to a decline in the growth rate to less than 4% per
annum. Despite an initial upturn in the growth rate, the decade unfolded with
persistent macroeconomic crises. Although achieving a noteworthy growth rate
of 8.6% in 2004–05, subsequent years were marred by a series of setbacks,
including a growth slowdown, low growth, high inflation, an energy crisis, and
worsening fiscal and balance of payments positions.

The economic landscape reflected the complexities faced by the population,
illustrated by a rise in poverty incidence to 34.5% in 2000–01. However, a
subsequent decrease to 22.3% in 2005–06 offered a nuanced perspective on the
decade's economic trajectory. The unemployment rate saw fluctuations, rising
to 7.8% in 2002 but later declining to 5% by 2008.

Efforts to enhance education and literacy rates were evident as adult literacy
stood at 55% in 2007–08. Nevertheless, challenges persisted, and economic
crises hit Pakistan in 2008, primarily influenced by the 2008 financial
crisis. Despite these adversities, economic growth in 2009–2010 reached a
respectable 4.1%, with positive contributions from various sectors, including
a 2% growth in agriculture, 4.9% growth in industrial output, 4.4% growth in
large-scale manufacturing, and a 4.6% expansion in the services sector.

By March 2010, public debt had accumulated to Rs. 8,160 billion, with a total
public debt/GDP ratio of 56% and a foreign-currency denominated debt/GDP ratio
of 25%. Amid these economic dynamics, Pakistan underwent a structural
transition. The GDP share of agriculture declined from 53% in 1947 to 21.2% in
2010, while the GDP share of industry rose from 9.6% in 1949–50 to 25.4% in
2010. Additionally, the GDP share of the services sector increased from 37.2%
in 1950 to 53.4% in 2010. The 2000s encapsulated a multifaceted economic
narrative for Pakistan, marked by challenges, crises, and significant
structural shifts, reflecting the nation's resilience and adaptability.

### Stock market

Statue of a bull outside the Islamabad Stock Exchange

In the first four years of the twenty-first century, Pakistan's KSE 100 Index
was declared the best-performing stock market index in the world by the
international magazine "Business Week".[_citation needed_] The stock market
capitalization of listed companies in Pakistan was valued at $5,937 million in
2005 by the World Bank. On 11 January 2016, with the aim of reducing market
fragmentation and creating a strong case for attracting strategic partnerships
necessary for providing technological expertise, all three stock exchanges,
including Karachi Stock Exchange, Lahore Stock Exchange, and Islamabad Stock
Exchange, were inducted into a unified Pakistan Stock Exchange.

In May 2017, the American provider of stock market indexes and analysis tools,
MSCI, confirmed that the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) had been reclassified
from Frontier Markets to Emerging Markets in its semi-annual index review. The
Pakistan Stock Exchange also successfully navigated through the initial
COVID-19 induced economic downturn and earned the title of being the 'best
Asian stock market and fourth best-performing market across the world in
2020.' The PSE-100 index continued to climb throughout the year. Nearly 40
percent growth in the PSE-100 Index in FY 2021 was driven by the government's
large stimulus package, the central bank's stable policy rate, an uptick in
large scale manufacturing, improvement in external accounts, and reforms
introduced by the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and PSX
in the wake of the COVID-19.

The sales of all non-financial companies surged to Rs 16,815 billion in the
fiscal year 2023, marking a substantial increase of Rs 1,864 billion compared
to the preceding year. However, the net profit margin of all companies
declined to 5.98% in FY23 from 6.34% in FY22. Return on assets (ROA) and
return on equity (ROE) of all companies also dropped to 6.05 percent and 17.76
percent respectively in FY23. The key statistics for the last six years of all
public and private non-financial companies listed at the Pakistan Stock
Exchange are provided in the following table:

### Middle class

The Dawood Centre in Karachi, M.T. Khan Road

As of 2017[update], according to the _Wall Street Journal_ , citing estimates
largely based on income and the purchase of consumption goods, had suggested
that as many as 42% of Pakistan's population may now belong to the upper and
middle classes. If these numbers are correct, or even indicative in any broad
sense, then 87 million Pakistanis belong to the middle and upper classes, a
population size which is larger than that of Germany. Official figures also
show that the proportion of households that own a motorcycle and washing
machines has grown impressively over the past 15 years. Furthermore, the IBA-
SBP Consumer Confidence Index recorded its highest-ever level of 174.9 points
in January 2017, showing an increase of 17 points from July 2016.

Separately, consumer financing recorded at Rs. 179 billion during FY 2022.
Auto finance continued to be the dominant segment, followed by house building,
which showed remarkable growth after the _Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar_ scheme
initiated by the State Bank of Pakistan in December 2020.

### Poverty alleviation expenditures

The Pakistan government spent over 1 trillion rupees (about $16.7 billion) on
poverty alleviation programs during the past four years, reducing poverty from
35% in 2000–01 to 29.3% in 2013 and further to 17% in 2015. Rural poverty
remains a pressing issue, as development in those areas has been significantly
slower than in major urban areas.

### Employment

The high population growth in the past few decades has led to a significant
number of young people entering the labor market. Although Pakistan is among
the six most populous Asian nations, excessive red tape in the past made
firing from jobs, and consequently hiring, difficult. Significant progress in
taxation and business reforms has ensured that many firms are no longer
compelled to operate in the underground economy.

### Government revenues and expenditures

Clifton in Karachi

Although the country is a Federation with constitutional division of taxation
powers between the Federal Government and the four provinces, the revenue
department of the Federal Government, the Federal Board of Revenue, collects
more than 80% of the entire national tax collection. The government's revenue
streams primarily stem from two sources: taxation and non-tax revenue.
Taxation, which includes income tax, sales tax, and customs duties,
constitutes a substantial portion of revenues, bolstering both federal and
provincial government finances. Non-tax revenue sources, such as mark-up from
state enterprises, surplus profits from the State Bank of Pakistan, and
royalties on oil and gas, further contribute significantly to the fiscal
framework.

Conversely, government expenditures are strategically allocated across
multiple sectors, including defense, social services, infrastructure
development, and debt servicing. Current expenditures, covering operational
costs, interest payments, pensions, and other obligations, are carefully
balanced against development expenditures aimed at fostering long-term growth
and progress. The challenge of achieving equilibrium between revenue
generation and expenditure allocation leads to budgetary deficits that can
necessitate borrowing to bridge the gap.

The data has been sourced from the Ministry of Finance.

## Currency system

### Rupee

The basic unit of currency is the rupee, ISO code PKR, and abbreviated Rs,
which is divided into 100 paisas. Currently, the 5,000 rupee note is the
largest denomination in circulation. From 13 August 2005, the SBP started
introducing its fifth generation design of banknotes with additional security
features, with the Rs. 20 note being the first issuance. New designs of Rs. 5
(July 2008, later replaced by a coin), 10 (May 2006), Rs. 20 (March 2008, new
color scheme), Rs. 50 (July 2008), Rs. 100 (November 2006), Rs. 500 (January
2010), Rs. 1000 (February 2007), and Rs. 5000 (May 2006) were gradually
introduced.

The Pakistani rupee was pegged to the pound sterling until 1982, when the
government of General Zia-ul-Haq, changed it to a managed float regime. As a
result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83, and many of the
industries built by his predecessor suffered a huge surge in import costs.
After years of appreciation under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and despite huge
increases in foreign aid, the rupee depreciated.

### Foreign exchange rate

The Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start
of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the
value of the rupee up versus the dollar. Pakistan's central bank then
stabilized by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, in order to preserve
the country's export competitiveness.

### Foreign exchange reserves

Pakistan maintains foreign reserves with the State Bank of Pakistan. The
currency of the reserves was solely the US dollar, incurring speculated losses
after the dollar prices fell during 2005, forcing the then Governor SBP Ishrat
Hussain to step down. In the same year, the SBP issued an official statement
proclaiming diversification of reserves in currencies including Euro and Yen,
withholding the ratio of diversification.

Karachi, the economic capital of Pakistan

Following the international credit crisis and spikes in crude oil prices,
Pakistan's economy could not withstand the pressure, and on 11 October 2008,
the State Bank of Pakistan reported that the country's foreign exchange
reserves had gone down by $571.9 million to $7,749.7 million. The foreign
exchange reserves had declined by more than $10 billion to a level of $6.59
billion. In June 2013, Pakistan was on the brink of default on its financial
commitments. The country's forex reserves were at a historic low, covering
only two weeks' worth of imports. In January 2020, Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves stood at US$11.503 billion.

## Structure of economy

Agriculture accounted for about 53% of the GDP in 1947. While per-capita
agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth
of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to
roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen
rapid growth in industries, such as apparel, textiles, and cement, and
services, such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and
finance.

## Major sectors

### Agriculture

Yellow and green fields in Punjab

The majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this
sector, contributing about 23.0% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and
accounting for 37.4% of the employed labor force in 2021. It is the largest
source of foreign exchange earnings. The most important crops are wheat,
sugarcane, cotton, and rice, accounting for more than 75% of the value of
total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan
produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1
million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes),
according to the FAOSTAT. In the market year of 2018/19, Pakistan exported a
record 4.5 million tonnes of rice.

Pakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest
is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits
(especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil,
wheat, pulses, and consumer foods. The economic importance of agriculture has
declined since independence when its share of GDP was around 53%.

Pakistan's principal natural resources are arable land and water. About 25% of
Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the
largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more
acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year-round warmth.
Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited is the largest financial institution geared
towards the development of the agriculture sector through the provision of
financial services and technical expertise.

### Industry

Factory in Pakistan

Pakistan's industrial sector accounts for approximately 19.12% of GDP. In
2021, it recorded a growth of 7.81%, compared to the negative 5.75% in 2020.
The government is privatizing large-scale industrial units, and the public
sector accounts for a shrinking proportion of industrial output, while growth
in overall industrial output (including the private sector) has accelerated.
Government policies aim to diversify the country's industrial base and bolster
export industries. Large Scale Manufacturing is the fastest-growing sector in
the Pakistani economy. Major industries include textiles, fertiliser, cement,
oil refineries, dairy products, food processing, beverages, construction
materials, clothing, paper products, and shrimp.

In Pakistan, SMEs have a significant contribution to the total GDP of
Pakistan. According to SMEDA and Economic survey reports, the share in the
annual GDP is 40%, with SMEs generating significant employment opportunities
for skilled workers and entrepreneurs. Small and medium-scale firms represent
nearly 90% of all enterprises in Pakistan and employ 80% of the non-
agricultural labor force. These figures indicate the potential and further
growth in this sector.

#### Manufacturing

Manufacturing is the largest of Pakistan's industrial sectors, accounting for
approximately 12.13% of GDP. The manufacturing sub-sector is further divided
into three components: large-scale manufacturing (LSM) with a share of 79.6%
in the manufacturing sector, small-scale manufacturing with a share of 13.8%
in the manufacturing sector, while slaughtering contributes 6.5% to
manufacturing. Major sectors in industries include cement, fertiliser, edible
oil, sugar, steel, tobacco, chemicals, machinery, food processing, and medical
instruments, primarily surgical. Pakistan is one of the largest manufacturers
and exporters of surgical instruments.

##### Cement industry

In 1947, Pakistan inherited four cement plants with a total capacity of 0.5
million tons. Some expansion occurred in 1956–66 but couldn't keep pace with
economic development. The country resorted to cement imports in 1976–77,
continuing until 1994–95. The cement sector, comprising 27 plants, contributes
over Rs 30 billion to the national exchequer in taxes. By 2013, Pakistan's
cement industry grew rapidly, driven by demand from Afghanistan and countries
boosting the real estate sector. In April 2020, the government introduced an
incentive package for the construction industry, including an amnesty scheme,
tax exemptions, and a Rs 36 billion subsidy for Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme.
Additionally, banks were directed to increase construction sector loans to 5
percent of their total loan book, and FED reduction on cement from Rs 2/kg to
Rs 1.5/kg provided further impetus to the industry.

##### Fertilizer industry

There are nine urea manufacturing plants, one DAP, three NP, four SSP, two
CAN, one SOP, and two plants of blended NPKs with a total production capacity
of 9,172 thousand tonnes per annum in 2021. Urea is the main fertilizer,
holding a 70 percent share in total production. The installed production
capacity of 6,307 thousand tonnes per annum is sufficient to meet local
demand, subject to the availability of uninterrupted gas and RLNG supply.

##### Defence industry

HIT-built Al-Khalid tank on display.

The defence industry of Pakistan, under the Ministry of Defence Production,
was established in September 1951 to promote and coordinate the array of
military production facilities that have emerged since independence. It is
actively engaged in numerous joint production projects, such as the Al Khalid
2 tank, advanced trainer aircraft, combat aircraft, artillery systems like
MRLS, combat and surveillance drones like GIDS Shahpar-1 and Shahpar-2, battle
management and surveillance radars, electronic warfare systems, navy ships,
and submarines.

Pakistan manufactures and sells weapons to over 40 countries, including
European customers, generating $620 million annually. The country's
sophisticated arms imports increased by 119 percent between 2004–2008 and
2009–13, with China providing 54 percent and the USA 27 percent of Pakistan's
imports.

##### Textiles industry

Most of the textile industry is concentrated in Punjab. However, before 1990,
the industry was predominantly located in Karachi.

Presently, the textile industry comprises two main segments: a highly
organized large-scale sector and a considerably fragmented cottage/small-scale
sector. The organized sector mainly includes integrated Textile Mills, housing
numerous spinning units and a limited number of shuttle-less loom units.
Conversely, the unorganized sector encompasses downstream industries like
Weaving, Finishing, Garment, Towels, and Hosiery, all of which possess
significant export potential. Within this sector, certain enterprises have
expanded to an international scale and exhibit progressive business
philosophies.

As of June 2021, the Pakistani textile industry comprised 517 textile units,
including 40 composite units and 477 spinning units. This landscape also
included 28,500 shuttle-less looms and 375,000 conventional looms. The growth
of the spinning sector has been fueled by export demands and cotton
production, with subsequent growth observed in the weaving and processing
sector. Notably, independent air-jet weaving units have emerged, both as
standalone entities and in conjunction with spinning or processing units.

A notable trend is the ongoing backward integration of some clothing units,
while spinning units are actively developing weaving, finishing, and assembly
capabilities to create a comprehensive supply chain. This symbiotic
relationship between the textile and clothing sectors is leading to horizontal
and vertical integration, often managed by the same entities or through
business collaborations.

This sector contributes nearly one-fourth of industrial value-added and
provides employment to about 40 percent of the industrial labor force.
Excluding seasonal and cyclical fluctuations, textile products have maintained
an average share of about 60 percent in national exports.[_citation needed_]

##### Automobile industry

Cars on Shahrah-e-Faisal in Karachi

The auto sector constituted about 7 percent of LSM in 2021, contributing
significantly to the country's industrial output. Given government support and
the removal of obstacles, the industrial expansion is expected to yield
positive results soon. Many new investors have joined with commercial
production, while existing players have already made substantial investments,
with more in the pipeline. Among the automakers yet to start production,
Proton, MG, and Volkswagen are poised to make a significant impact in the
local passenger vehicle market. Meanwhile, KIA, Hyundai, Changan, and Prince
DFSK have already commenced productions in Pakistan.

After the entry of new models and brands by new entrants and due to the
significantly low benchmark interest rate of 7%, consumer financing hit an
all-time high in 2021. This trend started when a new Automotive Development
Policy (2016–2021) was first approved by the ECC in its meeting held on 18
March 2016.

Such growth in demand for car financing was last seen during President Pervez
Musharraf's regime (2001–2008) when banks, having ample liquidity, lent a
significant amount for cars without checking borrowers' capabilities to repay
the debt. Later, the car financing bubble burst when a large number of people
defaulted on paying off the car financing.

#### Mining

Khewra Salt Mine in the Jhelum District

Pakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a
very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. In the
wake of the 18th amendment to the constitution, all the provinces are free to
exploit and explore the mineral resources within their jurisdiction.

Mining and quarrying contribute 13.19% to the industrial sector, with its
share in GDP being 2.4%.

In the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as
multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of
sizeable mineral deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone
underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered
by thick alluvial cover, have opened new vistas for metallic minerals
exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery
of coal deposits with over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh
province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of
energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.

Extraction of principal minerals in the last 10 fiscal years is given in the

#### Energy

Wind power plant between Karachi and Hyderabad

The main sources of Pakistan's primary energy supplies are gas, oil, coal,
liquefied natural gas (LNG), and hydroelectricity, with shares of 29%, 24%,
15%, 10%, and 11% respectively in 2022. Since coal mining began in the Thar
desert and LNG imports from Qatar, coal and imported LNG increased their
shares manyfold in just five years in the primary energy supplies of the
country. The share of gas has decreased from 50% in 2005 to 24% in 2022, and
oil, since 2015, from 35% to 27% in 2022, being largely replaced by coal and
LNG. As Pakistan intends to generate around 8,800 megawatts of nuclear power
by 2030, its share is also increasing gradually.

(CPPA-G) procures electricity from power producers, and the National
Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) transmits this electricity via its
transmission lines to Distribution Companies (DISCOs), which then distribute
this electricity via their distribution lines to end consumers. Balancing
Pakistan's supply of electricity against the demand has been a longstanding
unresolved issue. Since 2018, there has been an improvement in the
availability of electricity due to the substantial increase in generation
capacity. However, the cost of electricity has risen due to various factors
such as circular debt, capacity payments, fuel costs, currency devaluation,
low recovery rates, and transmission and distribution losses. Pakistan faces a
significant challenge in overhauling its electricity supply network.

The total production of refineries in Pakistan for fiscal year 2020–21 reached
10.66 million tons. Among these refineries, PARCO holds the largest share,
accounting for 41%, followed by ARL, BPPL, NRL, and PRL with shares of 17%,
16%, 14%, and 12% respectively. OGRA, founded in March 2002, serves as the
regulatory body with the primary goals of promoting competition and enhancing
private investment and ownership within the petroleum sector by implementing
effective and efficient regulations. Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have
established their infrastructure, including storage facilities and retail
outlets, to market Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricant (POL) products. Motor Spirit
(MS) and High-Speed Diesel (HSD) together make up nearly 80% of OMCs' sales.
By the conclusion of fiscal year 2021, OMCs had developed a storage capacity
of 0.58 million tons for MS and 0.88 million tons for HSD, distributed across
various depots throughout the country. Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) operate
a total of 9,978 retail outlets nationwide. Among these, Pakistan State Oil
(PSO) holds the highest number of retail outlets, boasting 3,158 outlets,
which accounts for approximately 31.65 percent of the total.

Indigenous natural gas supplies accounted for approximately 30 percent of
Pakistan's total primary energy supply mix in FY2022. Pakistan maintains an
extensive gas network comprising over 13,775 kilometers of transmission
pipelines, 157,395 kilometers of main pipelines, and 41,352 kilometers of
service pipelines. This network serves the needs of more than 10.7 million
consumers throughout the country. During FY 2021–22, the natural gas supply in
Pakistan reached 3,982 MMCFD. The country relies on several major gas fields,
including Sui, Uch, Qadirpur, Sawan, Zamzama, Badin, Bhit, Kandhkot, Mari, and
Manzalai, to meet its domestic demand. Additionally, Pakistan has been
importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) since 2015, with regasified liquefied
natural gas (RLNG) playing a significant role in alleviating natural gas
shortages. In the year 2021–22, approximately 24 percent of the country's gas
supplies were sourced from imported RLNG.

In FY 2020–21, the primary consumer of natural gas was the power sector, which
accounted for more than 30 percent of the total consumption, equivalent to
1,208 MMCFD. Following the power sector, the domestic sector consumed 21
percent, or 850 MMCFD, while the fertilizer sector consumed 20 percent,
totaling 834 MMCFD.

### Services

Pakistan's service sector contributes approximately 61.7% to the GDP. Within
this sector, transport, storage, communications, finance, and insurance
comprise 24%, while wholesale and retail trade constitute about 30%. Pakistan
is actively promoting the growth of the information industry and other modern
service industries by offering incentives such as long-term tax holidays.

#### Telecommunications

PTCL's One Stop Shop in Islamabad

After the deregulation of the telecommunications industry, the sector has
experienced exponential growth. Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL)
has emerged as a successful Forbes 2000 conglomerate with over US$1 billion in
sales in 2005. The mobile telephone market has expanded many-fold since 2003,
reaching a subscriber base of 140 million users in July 2017, one of the
highest mobile teledensities in the world. Pakistan won the prestigious
Government Leadership award of GSM Association in 2006.

In Pakistan, the following are the top mobile phone operators:

  1. Jazz Pakistan (parent: VEON, Netherlands)
  2. Ufone (parent: PTCL (Etisalat), Pakistan/UAE)
  3. Telenor (parent: Telenor, Norway)
  4. Zong (parent: China Mobile, China)

By March 2009, Pakistan had 91 million mobile subscribers – 25 million more
subscribers than reported in the same period in 2008. In addition to the 3.1
million fixed lines, as many as 2.4 million are using Wireless Local Loop
connections. Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Motorola along with Samsung and LG
remain the most popular brands among customers.

Since liberalisation, over the past four years from 2003 to 2007, the
Pakistani telecom sector has attracted more than $9 billion in foreign
investments. During 2007–08, the Pakistani communication sector alone received
$1.62 billion in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) – about 30% of the country's
total foreign direct investment.

According to the PC World, a total of 6.37 billion text messages were sent
through Acision messaging systems across Asia Pacific over the 2008/2009
Christmas and New Year period. Pakistan was amongst the top five rankers with
one of the highest SMS traffic with 763 million messages.

On 14 August 2010, Pakistan became the first country in the world to
experience EVDO's RevB 3G technology that offers maximum speeds of 9.3 Mbit/s.

3G and 4G were simultaneously launched in Pakistan on 23 April 2014 through a
SMRA auction. Three out of five companies got a 3G licence i.e. Ufone,
Mobilink and Telenor while China Mobile's Zong got 3G as well as a 4G licence.
Whereas the fifth company, Warid Pakistan did not participate in the auction
procedure, but they launched 4G LTE services on their existing 2G 1800 MHz
spectrum due to Technology-neutral terms and became the world's first Telecom
Company to transform directly from 2G to 4G. With that, Pakistan joined the 3G
and 4G world. In December 2017, 3G and 4G subscribers in Pakistan reached 46
million.

After the successful implementation of the Device Identification Registration
and Blocking System (DIRBS) in 2019 along with a comprehensive mobile
manufacturing policy, it created a favourable environment for mobile device
manufacturing in Pakistan. For the first time in the history of Pakistan,
local mobile phone manufacturing exceeded the number of mobile phones that
were imported in 2021. Mobile device manufacturing licences have been issued
to 26 companies, including Samsung, Redmi, Realme, Nokia, Oppo, TECNO,
Infinix, Itel, Vgotel, and Q-Mobile.

#### Transportation

##### Air linkage

Jinnah International Airport in Karachi

The year 1955 marked the inauguration of the Pakistan airline's first
scheduled international service – to London, via Cairo and Rome. In 1959, the
Government of Pakistan appointed Air Commodore Nur Khan as the managing
director of PIA. With his visionary leadership, PIA 'took off' and within a
short span of 6 years, gained the stature and status of one of the world's
frontline carriers. In aviation circles, this period has often been referred
to as the "golden years of PIA". On 29 April 1964, with a Boeing 720B, PIA
earned the distinction of becoming the first airline from a non-communist
country to fly into the People's Republic of China. Private sector airlines in
Pakistan include Airblue, which serves the main cities within Pakistan in
addition to destinations in the Persian Gulf and Manchester in the United
Kingdom.

##### Railway linkage

A Pakistan Railway train

Pakistan Railways (PR) is a major mode of transport in the public sector,
contributing to the country's economic growth and providing national
integration. 13 May 1861 was a historical day when the first railway line was
opened for public between Karachi City and Kotri, a distance of 169 km. In
1885, the Sindh, Punjab and Delhi Railways were purchased by the Secretary of
State for India. On 1 January 1886 this line and other State Railways were
integrated and North Western State Railway was formed; this was later renamed
as North Western Railways (NWR). At the time of Independence, the NWR was
bifurcated with 1,847 route miles lying in India and 5,048 route miles in
Pakistan. In 2022, Pakistan Railways comprised a total of 467 locomotives (462
diesel engines and 05 steam engines) for the 7,479 km route length. Pakistan
Railways employed 60,643 people in 2022.

The National Highway Authority (NHA) was established in 1991 through an Act of
Parliament for the planning, development, operation, repair, and maintenance
of National Highways and Strategic Roads specially entrusted to NHA by the
Federal Government or by a Provincial Government or other authority concerned.
NHA is the custodian of 39 national highways, motorways, expressways, and
strategic routes, with a total length of 12,131 km, constituting 4.6% of the
total national roads network, which is 263,775 km. However, it carries 80% of
commercial traffic, and the N-5 National Highway, which is the lifeline of
Pakistan, carries 65% of this load in the country.

##### Maritime linkage

Port of Karachi

Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) is a national flag carrier. It
was formed through the merger of the National Shipping Corporation and
Pakistan Shipping Corporation in 1979. PNSC has had worldwide operations in
the dry bulk segment of the shipping market since its inception, and has been
involved in the transportation of liquid cargo since 1998, both locally and
internationally. The corporation's head office is located in Karachi.
Currently, the PNSC fleet comprises eleven vessels of various types and sizes
(five bulk carriers, four Aframax tankers, and two LR-1 Clean Product tankers)
with a total deadweight capacity (cargo carrying capacity) of 831,711 metric
tons, the highest ever carrying capacity since the inception of PNSC.

#### Finance

Pakistan has a large and diverse banking system. In 1974, a nationalization
programme led to the creation of six government-owned banks. A privatization
programme in the 1990s led to the entry of foreign-owned and local banks into
the industry. As of 2010, there were five publicly-owned commercial banks in
Pakistan, as well as 25 domestic private banks, six multinational banks, and
four specialised banks.

headquarters of many banks in Pakistan can be found here.

Since 2000, Pakistani banks have begun aggressive marketing of consumer
finance to the emerging middle class, allowing for a consumption boom (more
than a seven-month waiting list for certain car models) as well as a
construction bonanza. Pakistan's banking sector remained remarkably strong and
resilient during the 2008 financial crisis, a feature which has served to
attract a substantial amount of FDI in the sector. Stress tests conducted in
June 2008 data indicate that the large banks are relatively robust, with the
medium and small-sized banks positioning themselves in niche markets.

The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at
Rs.807,807 million in 2012, thus registering over 510% growth since 2000.

An article published in the _Journal of the Asia Pacific Economy_ by Mete
Feridun of the University of Greenwich in London with his Pakistani colleague
Abdul Jalil presents strong econometric evidence that financial development
fosters economic growth in Pakistan.

In recent years, banking through digital channels has been gaining popularity
in the country. These channels offer alternatives resulting in faster delivery
of financial services to a wide range of customers. Significant progress has
been observed in the usage of internet banking and mobile banking channels
during the last few years. In the last five years,[_when?_] internet banking
transactions saw compound annualised growth of 31%, whereas mobile banking
transactions grew by 86%.

#### Housing

House on mountains in Murree

The property sector has expanded 23-fold since 2001, particularly in
metropolises like Lahore. Nevertheless, the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and
Industry estimated in late 2006 that the overall production of housing units
in Pakistan has to be increased to 0.5 million units annually to address 6.1
million backlog of housing in Pakistan for meeting the housing shortfall in
next 20 years. The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly
aging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years
old. It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums
and squatter settlements. The report said that meeting the backlog in housing,
besides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial
resources of the government. This necessitates putting in place a framework to
facilitate financing in the formal private sector and mobilise non-government
resources for a market-based housing finance system. To promote affordable
housing and home ownership among low to middle-income group, who currently do
not own a house, SBP in 2020 introduced the Government's Mark-Up Subsidy
Scheme, through which subsidized financing is provided to individuals for
construction or purchase of a new house. Since then, a huge demand for house
financing has been witnessed by the commercial banks.

#### Tourism

Tourism in Pakistan has been hailed as the tourism industry's "next big
thing". Pakistan, with its diverse cultures, people, and landscapes, has
attracted 90 million tourists to the country, almost double that of a decade
ago. Currently, Pakistan ranks 130th in the world by tourist income. Due to
the threat of terrorism, the number of foreign tourists has gradually
declined, and the shock of the 2013 Nanga Parbat tourist shooting has severely
adversely affected the tourism industry. As of 2016[update], tourism has begun
to recover in Pakistan, albeit gradually, with a current global rank of 130.

## Foreign trade, remittances, aid, and investment

### Investment

Foreign investment significantly declined by 2010, dropping by 54.6% due to
Pakistan's political instability and weak law and order, according to the Bank
of Pakistan.

Business regulations have been overhauled along liberal lines, especially
since 1999. Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct
investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions
on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation
is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends,
service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been
becoming increasingly difficult over the past decade due to political
instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement
corruption. This can be confirmed by the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business
Index report degrading its ratings for Pakistan each year since September
2009.

The World Bank (WB) and International Finance Corporation's flagship report
Ease of Doing Business Index 2020 ranked Pakistan 108 among 190 countries
around the globe, indicating a continuous improvement and taking a jump from
136 last year. The top five countries were New Zealand, Singapore, Denmark,
Hong Kong and South Korea.

With improvement in ease of doing business ranking and giving an investment
friendly road map from government, many new auto sector giants like France's
Renault, South Korean's Hyundai and Kia, Chinese JW Forland and German auto
giant Volkswagen are considering entry into Pakistan auto market through joint
ventures with local manufacturers like Dewan Farooque Motors, Khalid Mushtaq
Motors and United Motors. As of March 2022, only the Hyundai Nishat JV
materialised.

US oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil returned to Pakistan after nearly three
decades gap and has acquired 25% shares in offshore drilling in May 2018, with
initial survey showing a potential of huge hydrocarbon reserves discovery
offshore.

To boost Pakistan's unstable foreign-exchange reserves, Qatar announced to
invest $3 billion in the form of deposits and direct investments in the
country. By the end of June 2019, Qatar sent the first $500 million to
Pakistan.

### Foreign acquisitions and mergers

With the rapid growth in Pakistan's economy, foreign investors are taking a
keen interest in the corporate sector of Pakistan. In recent years, majority
stakes in many corporations have been acquired by multinational groups.

  * PICIC by Singapore-based Temasek Holdings for $339 million
  * Union Bank by Standard Chartered Bank for $487 million
  * Prime Commercial Bank by ABN Amro for $228 million
  * PakTel by China Mobile for $460 million
  * PTCL by Etisalat for $1.8 billion
  * Additional 57.6% shares of Lakson Tobacco Company acquired by Philip Morris International for $382 million
  * In 2016, Arçelik acquired Dawlance for $243 million.
  * In 2016, FrieslandCampina acquired 51% stake in Engro Foods for $446.81 million.
  * In 2016, The Abraaj Group sold its 66.4% stake in K-Electric to Shanghai Electric for $1.77 billion.

The foreign exchange receipts from these sales are also helping cover the
current account deficit.

### Foreign trade

Gwader port in Balochistan

Pakistan witnessed the highest export of US$25.4 billion in the FY 2011.
However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This decline
started from the financial year 2015 when an international commodity slump set
in. This was compounded by structural supply-side constraints including energy
shortages, high input costs, and an overvalued exchange rate. From the
financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. The exports
growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns.
Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2017. Still,
Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal
year 2017. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a
large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.

Note: This is the trade data (export and import) as released by the SBP. This
may differ from the data compiled by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

Pakistan's imports are showing a rising trend at a relatively faster rate due
to increased economic activity as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor
(CPEC), particularly in the energy sector. The construction projects under
CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that
the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption,
resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018, Pakistan's
exports picked up and reached US$24.8 billion, showing a growth of 12.6
percent over the previous year, FY 2017. Imports, on the other hand, also
increased by 16.2 percent, reaching the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As
a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion, which was the highest
in the last ten years. Pakistan's exports of goods recorded their highest
level of $25.6 billion during the fiscal year 2021, higher than the $25.3
billion recorded in 2011.

### External imbalances

During FY 2017, the increase in imports of capital equipment and fuel
significantly put pressure on the external account. A reversal in global oil
prices led to an increase in POL imports, accompanied by falling exports; as a
result, the merchandise trade deficit grew by 39.4 percent to US$26.885
billion in FY 2017. While remittances and Coalition Support Fund inflows both
declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was
offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit
repatriations by oil and gas firms.

The current account deficit increased to US$19.2 billion in FY 2018.

However, the impact of high current deficit on foreign exchange reserves was
not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially
offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate.
Net FDI grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-month
period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of
US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the
completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign
companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to
enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with
local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign
investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going
forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the
international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.

Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions
(IFIs) like the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and from bilateral
partners like China, in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of
US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX
reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around
four months of import payments.

### Economic aid

Pakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB), Asian Development Bank
(ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives
bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. Foreign aid has been one
of the main sources of money for the Pakistani economy. Collection of foreign
aid has been one of the priorities of almost every Pakistani Government with
the Prime Minister himself leading delegations on a regular basis to collect
foreign aid.

The Asian Development Bank will provide close to $6 billion development
assistance to Pakistan during 2006–9. The World Bank unveiled a lending
programme of up to $6.5 billion for Pakistan under a new four-year, 2006–2009,
aid strategy showing a significant increase in funding aimed largely at
beefing up the country's infrastructure. Japan will provide $500 million
annual economic aid to Pakistan. In November 2008, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has approved a loan of 7.6 billion to Pakistan, to help stabilise
and rebuild the country's economy. Between the 2008 and 2010 fiscal years, the
IMF extended loans to Pakistan totalling 5.2 billion dollars. The government
decided in 2011 to cut off ties with the IMF. However, the government newly
elected in 2013 re-established these ties, and a negotiated a three-year $6.6
billion package which would allow it to deal with ongoing debt issues. In May
2019, Pakistan finalised a US$6 billion foreign aid with IMF. This is
Pakistan's 22nd such bailout from the IMF.

The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor is being developed with a contribution of
mainly concessionary loans from China under the Belt and Road Initiative. Much
like BRI, the value of CPEC investments transcends any fiat currency and is
only estimated vaguely as it spans over decades of past and future industrial
development and global economic influence.

### Remittances

The remittances of Pakistanis living abroad have played an important role in
Pakistan's economy and foreign exchange reserves. Pakistanis settled in
Western Europe and North America are significant sources of remittances to
Pakistan. Since 1973, Pakistani workers in the oil-rich Arab states have been
sources of billions of dollars of remittances.

The 9 million-strong Pakistani diaspora contributed US$19.3 billion to the
economy in FY2017. The major source countries of remittances to Pakistan
include UAE, US, Saudi Arabia, GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait,
Qatar, and Oman), Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, UK, and EU
countries.

Remittances sent home by overseas Pakistani workers saw a negative growth of
3.0% in the fiscal year 2017 compared to the previous year when remittances
reached an all-time high of 19.9 billion US dollars. This decline in
remittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions in Arabian and
Gulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, recent
development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's
implementation of its Vision 2030, and particularly the recent visit of the PM
to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these
countries. Going forward, one can expect improvements in the coming years. The
SBP's data showed that remittances amounted to $29.4 billion for the year
2021. The government and SBP took measures to incentivise the use of formal
channels of sending money home. The orderly foreign exchange market conditions
also contributed to the rise in remittances. Remittances helped improve the
country's external sector position despite the challenging global economic
conditions due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Data is taken from SBP and Ministry of Finance.

### Corruption

Corruption Perceptions Index for Pakistan compared to other countries, 2020

Corruption is an ongoing issue in the government, with claims of initiatives
against it, particularly at the government and lower levels of police forces.
In 2011, the country consistently ranked poorly on the Transparency
International's Corruption Perceptions Index, with scores of 2.5, 2.3 in 2010,
and 2.5 in 2009 out of 10. In 2011, Pakistan ranked 134th on the index, with
42 countries ranking worse. In 2012, Pakistan's ranking dropped further from
134 to 139, making Pakistan the 34th most corrupt country in the world, tied
with Azerbaijan, Kenya, Nepal, and Nigeria. However, during the Sharif regime
(2013–17), Pakistan improved its ranking to 117th out of 180 countries in 2017
(with an improvement in score from 28, 29, 30, 32, 32 [2013–17]), equal to
Egypt (better than 59 countries). Due to the adverse effects of corruption on
the country, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was established in 1999.
The primary purpose of NAB was to recover looted money from corrupt elements
and deposit it in the national exchequer. From 2018 to 2020, NAB recovered Rs
502 billion from corrupt elements, a record achievement. Since the bureau's
inception, NAB has recovered Rs 814 billion directly or indirectly from
corrupt elements, exceeding the recovery of other such anti-corruption
organizations.

### Debt
