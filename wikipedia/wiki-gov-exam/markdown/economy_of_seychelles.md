The **economy of Seychelles** is based on fishing, tourism, processing of
coconuts and vanilla, coir rope, boat building, printing, furniture and
beverages. Agricultural products include cinnamon, sweet potatoes, cassava
(tapioca), bananas, poultry and tuna.

The public sector, comprising the government and state-owned enterprises,
dominates the economy in terms of employment and gross revenue, employing two-
thirds of the labor force. Government consumption absorbs over one-third of
Seychelles's GDP.[_citation needed_]

## Economic history

The French originally settled the Seychelles in 1770, setting up plantations
which relied heavily on slave labour to produce cotton, sugar, rice, and
maize. The British took control of the Seychelles during the Napoleonic Wars
without removing the French upper class.

After the British prohibited slavery in 1835, the influx of African workers
did not end because British warships captured Arab slavers and forced the
liberated slaves to work on plantations as apprentices without pay.

In the 1960s, about 33% of the working population worked at plantations, and
20% worked in the public or government sector.

Aircraft at Seychelles International Airport.

Plantations were the main industry of the Seychelles until 1971, when the
international airport opened. Overnight, tourism became a serious industry,
basically dividing the economy into plantations and tourism. The tourism
sector paid better, and the plantation economy could only expand so far.

The plantation sector of the economy declined in prominence, and tourism and
fishing became the primary industries of Seychelles. In the 1960s, about 33%
of the working population worked at plantations, but by 2006 it was less than
3%.

While the tourism and industrial fishing industries were flourishing in the
late 1990s, the traditional plantation economy atrophied. Cinnamon barks and
copra—traditional export crops—dwindled to negligible amounts by 1991. There
were no exports of copra in 1996; 318 tons of cinnamon bark was exported in
1996, reflecting a decrease of 35% in cinnamon bark exports from 1995.

The US military Indian Ocean Tracking Station on Mahé operated from 1963 until
1996.

## Current economy

Since Seychelles' independence in 1976, per capita output has expanded to
roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level.[_citation needed_] Growth
has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force
and provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, followed by tuna
fishing.[_citation needed_] In recent years[_which?_] the government has
encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other
services.[_citation needed_]

At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism
by promoting the development of farming, fishing, small-scale manufacturing
and most recently the offshore sector. The vulnerability of the tourist sector
was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf
War.[_citation needed_] Although the industry has rebounded, the government
recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in the face of stiff
international competition. Other issues facing the government are the curbing
of the budget deficit and further privatization of public
enterprises.[_citation needed_]

Despite attempts to improve its agricultural base and emphasize locally
manufactured products and indigenous materials, Seychelles imports 90% of the
food it consumes.[_citation needed_] The exceptions are some fruits and
vegetables, fish, poultry, pork, and beer.[_citation needed_] In addition to
that, Seychelles also produces cigarettes, paint, and a few plastic items.
Imports of all kind are controlled by the Seychelles Marketing Board (SMB), a
government parastatal which operates all the major supermarkets and is the
distributor and licensor of most other imports.[_citation needed_]

In an effort to increase agricultural self-sufficiency, Seychelles has
undertaken steps to make the sector more productive and to provide incentives
to farmers. Much of the state holdings in the agricultural sector have been
privatized, while the role of the government has been reduced to conducting
research and providing infrastructure.[_citation needed_]

In 2020, the Corruption Perception Index from Transparency International
assessed Seychelles as the least corrupt country in Africa.

Wikivoyage has a travel guide for _**Seychelles**_.

Fisherman landing his catch, in the early 1970s

Tourism is one of the most important sectors of the economy, accounting for
approximately 16.6% (2000) of GDP. Employment, foreign earnings, construction,
banking, and commerce are all dominated by tourism-related industries. Tourism
earned $631 million in 1999–2000. About 130,046 tourists visited Seychelles in
2000, 80.1% of them from Europe (United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, and
Switzerland).

In 2000, industrial fishing surpassed tourism as the most important foreign
exchange earner. Manufacturing, construction, and industrial fishing, notably
tuna fishing, account for about 28.8% of the GDP. Earnings are growing
annually from licensing fees paid by foreign trawlers fishing in Seychelles'
territorial waters.

In 1995, Seychelles saw the privatization of the Seychelles Tuna Canning
Factory, 60% of which was purchased by the American food company Heinz.
Similarly, some port operations have been privatized, a trend that has been
accompanied by a fall in transshipment fees and an increase in efficiency.
Overall, this has sparked a recovery in port services following a drastic fall
in 2009.

### Manufacturing

Many of the other industrial activities are limited to small scale
manufacturing, particularly agro-processing and import substitution.
Agriculture (including artisanal and forestry), once the backbone of the
economy, now accounts for around 3% of the GDP.

The Seychelles economy is extremely vulnerable to external shocks. Not only
does it depend on tourism, but it imports over 90% of its total primary and
secondary production inputs. Any decline in tourism quickly translates into a
fall in GDP, a decline in foreign exchange receipts, and budgetary
difficulties.

### Economic growth

Growth slowed in 1998–2001, due to sluggish tourist and tuna sectors. Also,
tight controls on exchange rates and the scarcity of foreign exchange have
impaired short-term economic prospects. The black market value of the
Seychellois rupee is anywhere from two thirds to one half the official
exchange rate.[_citation needed_] The next few years were also slow due to the
worldwide economic downturn and the fear of flying brought on by the terrorism
on 11 September 2001.

More recently though, tourism has roared back at a record pace setting
successive records in 2006 and again in 2007 for number of visitors.[_citation
needed_] The increased availability of flights to and from the archipelago due
in part to new entrants Emirates and Qatar airlines is also beginning to show.
Both at official exchange rates and at purchasing power parity (PPP),
Seychelles remains the richest territory in Africa in terms of GDP per capita
(US$9,440.095 at real exchange rates and US$17,560.062 at PPP 2008 estimate),

Because of economic contraction (the economy declined by about 2% in 2004 and
2005 and lost another 1.4% in 2006 according to the International Monetary
Fund) the country was moving downwards in terms of per capita income. However,
the economy bounced back in 2007, growing by 5.3% due in part to record
tourism numbers and the booming building and offshore industries. The IMF
forecast further growth in 2008 with continuing increase in the GDP per
capita.

In October 2008, as tourism and fishing revenue began slowing, the Seychelles
defaulted on a $230 million debt. The International Monetary Fund stepped with
a two-year, $26 million rescue package. The rescue package came with a few
stipulations; The country laid off 1,800 government workers, floated its
currency, lifted foreign exchange controls and sold off state assets. At the
time, the country's $800 million external foreign debt was equivalent to
almost 175 percent of its gross domestic product.

The decision to let the currency trade freely as part of the IMF rescue
package means that Seychelles is the smallest country in the world that has a
completely independent currency - one that is neither pegged, nor an adopted
foreign currency, nor a common currency used within a larger monetary union.
When the Seychellois rupee became freely floated on 3 November 2008, its value
quickly fell drastically, decreasing from eight per U.S. dollar to 16,
effectively doubled the prices of imports.

The global recession and piracy in the Indian Ocean hit Seychelles hard in
2009, with the GDP projected to contract by 7.5 percent. However the
government exceeded its fiscal targets, with a primary surplus of 13.4% of GDP
in the first nine months of 2009 according to the IMF. They report expenditure
has been tightly controlled and revenue has held up well despite the difficult
economic environment.

In May 2010 an International Monetary Fund mission visited Seychelles and
concluded the country is making progress. The head of the mission, Mr. Jean Le
Dem, said at the conclusion of the visit:

> The economy is recovering from a recession that put real gross domestic
> product (GDP) to almost a stand in 2009. Real GDP is projected to grow at 4
> percent in 2010, reflecting primarily a rebound in tourism earnings. Twelve-
> month inflation, which was negative during the past few months, is expected
> to return to about 1 percent by year-end

In 2017 the Seychelles joined the World Trade Organisation, facilitated by
Omani economist Hilda al-Hinai, who chaired the Working Group.

In addition to the now booming tourism and building/real estate markets,
Seychelles has renewed its commitment to developing its financial services
sector. Government officials and industry participants believe this could
overtake the tourism industry as the chief pillar of the economy by 2017. The
recent passage of a revised Mutual Fund Act 2007, Securities Act 2007 and
Insurance Act 2007 are meant to be the catalysts to move Seychelles from just
another offshore jurisdiction to a full-fledged Offshore Financial Center
(OFC).

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for economic decisions and budgetary
policy. A separate Monetary Authority supervises the banking system and
manages the money supply. Although foreign banks operate branches in
Seychelles, the government owns the two local banks—the Development Bank of
Seychelles, which mobilizes resources to fund development programs, and the
Seychelles Saving Bank, a bank for savings and current accounts.

The Financial Services Authority (formerly Seychelles International Business
Authority - SIBA) is charged with overseeing the quickly growing non-banking
financial services industry.

### Offshore oil and gas

New detailed studies and exploration shows that the Seychelles potentially
have large off-shore petroleum reservoirs which are yet to be discovered.
Drills have proven the presence of:

  1. Oil-prone source rocks containing Type II kerogen in coaly deltaic shales of the Middle Jurassic and in marine shales of the Upper Jurassic;
  2. Mixed source rocks bearing Type II/III kerogen in deltaic marine shales of the Lower Cretaceous that are II correlative of oil-generating shales in Somalia;
  3. Gas-prone sources containing Type I kerogen in Upper Triassic fluvial shales and Paleocene marine shales, the latter being correlative of oil and gas generating source rocks of the Deep Continental Shelf trend of the Bombay High Oil Province offshore west India;
  4. Evidence of hydrocarbon generation and migration with well shows, such as 0.7 ml benzene in DST-1 of Reith Bank-1, 10,010 ppm of 99.8% n-C4 headspace gas coincident with as small fault in the same well and 20% petrol vapours at an immature level of volcanics in Owen Bank A-1;
  5. Clastic reservoirs with measured porosities up to 22% in the Early-Middle Jurassic;
  6. Sealing lithologies occur both locally in syn-rift, and regionally in post-rift sequences;
  7. An extensive seismic dataset, plus a variety of remote sensing data have been collected which bolster the well data by confirming the presence of:
  8. A variety of trapping styles, dominated by tilted fault blocks, stratigraphic pinchouts and reefs;
  9. Multiple heating events, with the principal event post-dating trap formation; and
  10. Hydrocarbon generation and migration with the presence of: a) numerous DHIs on seismic, including gas chimneys, flat spots, bright spots, phase changes and chemosynthetic reefs; b) gas sniffer anomalies, involving ethane/iso-butane in the southeast and propane/normal butane/total hydrocarbon in the north and northeast; c) UV fluorescence anomalies, especially over the wells and in the southeast; and d) 4 types of beach-stranded tar that correlate to the local source rock stratigraphy.

However, to date all exploratory and stratigraphic test wells (a total of 9
since the 1970s) in the Seychelles have failed to find commercial
hydrocarbons. The most recent wildcat by Enterprise Oil in 1995 detected gas
but failed to find hydrocarbons.

Several oil and gas exploration companies are active in the Seychelles
offshore. These include East African Exploration (EAX) (a subsidiary of
Afren), Avana Petroleum (a subsidiary of Vanoil Energy) and WHL Energy.

Beginning at the turn of the millennium the Seychelles Petroleum Company
(SEPEC) started to develop the first fleet of modern petroleum double-hull
tankers, with five vessels, which was completed by late 2007/early 2008 with
the possibility to build more in the near future. The Seychelles President
claims that this has opened the door to a new industry for his country and
encouraged economic growth by further removing over-reliance on traditional
trades like fisheries and tourism, which is now falling rapidly as the
country's main income but nevertheless, has experienced significant growth in
recent years.

The country has also increased its capacity for wind power, with windfarms on
Romainville Island.
