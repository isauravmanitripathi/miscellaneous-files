The **economy of Suriname** was largely dependent upon the exports of
aluminium oxide and small amounts of aluminium produced from bauxite mined in
the country. However, after the departure of Alcoa, the economy depended on
the exports of crude oil and gold. Suriname was ranked the 124th safest
investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk
rankings.

## Agriculture

A member of CARICOM, Suriname also exports in small numbers rice, shrimp,
timber, bananas, fruits, and vegetables. Fernandes Group is a soft drinks
company bottled by Coca-Cola world-wide.

Other agricultural products of Suriname palm kernels, coconuts, peanuts; beef,
chickens; forest products; shrimp.

### Rice

In 2018, Suriname produced 273 thousand tons of rice, 125 thousand tons of
sugar cane, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products,
such as banana (48 thousand tons), orange (19 thousand tons) and coconut (14
thousand tons).

### Hardwood

Some big companies are getting the hardwood out of the jungle. However,
proposals for exploitation of the country's tropical forests and undeveloped
regions of the interior traditionally inhabited by indigenous and Maroon
communities have raised the concerns of environmentalists and human rights
activists both in Suriname and abroad. These opposing parties are not yet
strong in Suriname.

### Bananas

State-owned banana producer Surland closed its doors on April 5, 2002, after
its inability to meet payroll expenses for the second month in a row; it is
still unclear if Surland will survive this crisis.

The banana producer Surland was remodeled as Stichting Behoud Bananen Sector
Suriname (SBBS). The rumour was that because of political differences Surland
was manipulated into shutting down. The SBBS had made bananas profitable for
the first time in 20 years. There is also wide production of plantains in
Suriname.

## Mineral industry

### Gold

Currently gold exports make up 60-80% of all exports earnings. In 2021 the
gold industry accounted for 8.5% of the GDP. The share of large-scale mining
in total gold production is 58% compared to 42% of small-scale mining. With an
export value of USD 1.83 billion in 2023, the gold sector makes an important
contribution to the economy.

In early 2025, Suriname’s gold industry faced significant scrutiny after
revelations of major oversight failures by the Foreign Currency Committee,
which monitors gold exports and foreign currency flows. Finance and Planning
Minister Stanley Raghoebarsing disclosed that a private plane carrying gold
with an official export permit had been intercepted, yet the shipment would
yield no state revenue. This incident exposed broader issues, including the
issuance of numerous opaque and unjustified export permits, some granted to
parties not actively exporting gold. Despite high gold prices and increased
mining activity, official gold export figures were abnormally low, and the
government estimated a loss of at least US$300 million in recent months. These
irregularities contributed to the depreciation of the Surinamese dollar and
rising foreign currency prices. The minister pledged to implement stricter
oversight and reforms.

### Bauxite

The backbone of Suriname's economy was the export of aluminium oxide (alumina)
and small amounts of aluminium produced from bauxite mined in the country. In
1999, the aluminium smelter at Paranam was closed. In November 2015 Suralco
ceased the mining of bauxite completely.

## Oil

The exploration and exploitation of oil adds substantially to the economy of
Suriname at about 10% of the GDP. The national oil company, STAATSOLIE, is the
motor behind Suriname's oil industry. Their core business is oil extraction
and refining.

In 2012 STAATSOLIE produced 16,200 barrels (2,580 m3) a day. Staatsolie
currently refines 16,500 barrels a day at Tout Lui Faut refinery in the
District of Wanica. Furthermore, they own a 96 MW powerplant and a 189 MW
hydro powerplant. They also have their own retail gas stations under their
Gow2 brand. They also claim to be a well-established bunker supplier in the
Caribbean region.

In 2022 they reported revenue of USD 840 million. In that year their
contribution to the state treasury was USD 320 million. In 2023 they made
revenue of USD 722 million. The drop in revenue was because of the lower price
for oil per barrel that year. Their contribution to the Surinamese state
treasury was USD 335 million.

Other players in the off-shore oil industry in Suriname are Total Energies,
Apache, Shell and Petronas. These companies have signed product sharing
contracts with STAATSOLIE for the exploration and extraction of off-shore oil.
The first of these contracts was signed in 2015. In 2023 they signed three
more of such contracts.

In 2020 the first off-shore oil was found. Currently STAATSOLIE, local
partners and Surinamese companies, as well as the Surinamese government are
actively anticipating on the development of the off-shore oil industry. The
first production will start with the development of oil block 58 in 2028 in
which STAATSOLIE has a share of 20%. It's projected that Suriname will make
around USD 7 billion in the first five production years.

## Currency

Moreover, in January 2002, the government renego STAATSOLIE and other local
players are anticipating on the development of the off-shore oil
industry.tiated civil servant wages (a significant part of the work force and
a significant portion of government expenditure), agreeing to raises as high
as 100%. Pending implementation of these wage increases and concerned that the
government may be unable to meet these increased expenses, the local currency
weakened from Sf 2200 in January 2002 to nearly Sf 2500 in April 2002. On
March 26, 2003, the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) adjusted the exchange rate
of the U.S. dollar. This action resulted in further devaluation of the
Surinamese guilder. The official exchange rate of the US$ was SF 2,650 for
selling and SF 2,600 for purchasing. With the official exchange rate, the CBvS
came closer to the exchange rate on the parallel market which sold the U.S.
dollar for SF 3,250.

With the beginning of 2004 the Surinamese dollar (SRD) was introduced with an
exchange rate of 1000 Surinamese gulden to 1 Surinamese dollar. Before 2004:
Surinamese gulden (SRG) = 100 cent, SRD 1 = SRG 1000; coins had extremely low
official value and a much higher collector's value; their official value has
now been multiplied by 1000: the value in SRD cent is equal to the former
value in SRG cent. The same applies for "currency notes" (SRG 1 and 2.50).

Surinamese guilders per US dollar - 2,346.75 (2002), 2,178.5 (2001), 1,322.47
(2000), 859.44 (1999), 401 (1998)  
Note: during 1998, the exchange rate splintered into four distinct rates; in
January 1999 the government floated the guilder, but subsequently fixed it
when the black-market rate plunged; the government then allowed trading within
a band of SRG 500 around the official rate

Between 2004 and 2022, the value of the new Surinamese dollar (SRD) was set by
the central bank. The Central Bank of Suriname spent much of Suriname's
foreign currency reserves supporting the official exchange rates as inflation
and other factors caused the real value of the Surinamese dollar to decline
against other reserve currencies. As with the previous Surinamese guilder, the
difference between the official exchange rate and the decreasing real value of
the currency allowed black market currency trading to thrive. In June 2021,
the central bank devalued the SRD by 33% and announced the currency would
float freely. By June 2022, official exchange rates began to reflect the real
floating exchange rate.

## External debt and restructuring

As of February 2021, Suriname's external debt stands at US$4 billion. Of this
amount, the nation sought to restructure a total of US$675 million in loans.
Suriname retained French investment bank Lazard to act as its financial
advisor during the restructuring.

## Stock Exchange

The Suriname Stock Exchange (SSX) is the stock exchange of Suriname. The
exchange was established in 1994 by the Association for Securities Trading in
Suriname (VvES), founded on January 1, 1994. Stock trading does not occur
daily but twice a month on the first and third Thursday. There are twelve
companies listed on the exchange.

### Major events

In April 2025, Suriname experienced a significant rise in the price of the
euro, which reached SRD 41.33. Finance and Planning Minister Stanley
Raghoebarsing attributed the increase to international developments,
particularly the weakening of the U.S. dollar following new American trade
policies. On 3 April 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff
on all imports and higher rates on goods from around 60 economies. These
measures, analysts noted, could trigger global economic disruptions.
Raghoebarsing emphasized that the euro surge was not due to domestic policy
and urged the public not to panic.

## Mechanisms

The Suriname-Netherlands Chamber at the embassy of Suriname in The Hague

There are several Chambers of Commerce that are supporting the economy. The
general Chamber of Commerce and Factories (KKF) is located in Paramaribo. It
was founded on 1 May 1910 and has nearly 30,000 members in 2019 that provide
more than 150,000 jobs. Next to that, there are several international
Chambers. One of them is the Suriname-Netherlands Chamber of Commerce that is
established at the embassy of Suriname in The Hague. At the Chamber it is
possible to found a Surinamese company in the Netherlands. Furthermore there
is a Suriname-Guyana Chamber of Commerce, a Suriname-India Chamber of Commerce
and Industry and a Ghana-Suriname Chamber of Commerce.

In 2021 the government of Suriname founded the Suriname Investment and Trade
Agency (SITA) to support international investments in Suriname and exports of
Surinamese products abroad.
