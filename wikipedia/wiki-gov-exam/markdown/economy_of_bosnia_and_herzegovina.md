The **economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina** is a developing, upper-middle income
economy. Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from socialist
Yugoslavia on 1 March 1992. The main trading partners are Germany, Italy,
Austria, Turkey and neighboring countries in Southeast Europe.

## Overview

Bosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has
accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. It is an EU candidate country
and is embarking on a new growth model after a period of slow growth and the
2008 financial crisis. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small, open economy,
dominated by services, which accounted for 55% of gross domestic product (GDP)
in 2016, with a moderately developed industrial and manufacturing sector (23%
and 12%, respectively), and a limited agricultural base (about 6% of GDP).

The konvertibilna marka (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency
introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and
the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however,
has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level
institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks,
primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A
sizable current account deficit and a very high unemployment rate remain the
two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts
of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international
community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

The United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the
Country Commercial Guide – an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look
at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using
economic, political, and market analysis.

According to Serbian American economist, Branko Milanović, Bosnia and
Herzegovina did the best job in the transition from socialism to capitalism
when compared to the other republics of the former Yugoslavia. From 1985 until
2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina performed the best on the annual average GDP
growth per capita (1.6%), Slovenia (1.4%), Croatia (1%), Serbia without Kosovo
(0.9%) and North Macedonia (0.5%).

At the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), Bosnia and
Herzegovina was an important mineral processing centre and provided the other
republics with basic mineral commodities in exchange for current consumption
goods. While large amounts of public capital investments poured in during the
1970s, productivity levels remained low, often due to the limited capacity of
public managers. Under former republican premier Džemal Bijedić, and Yugoslav
president Tito, metal-product industries were promoted in the republic,
resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products
plants.

Merging small firms into larger agglomerates was a common practice in the SFRY
to preserve employment levels. As a result, four large conglomerates emerged
in Bosnia and Herzegovina over time: Energoinvest (energy sector), Unis
(automotive and defence industry, which partnered with Volkswagen in the early
1970s), Šipad (wood processing) and RMK Zenica (steel industry, later acquired
by ArcelorMittal). Construction and defence were important industries in the
Bosnian economy, despite their low efficiency and, ultimately, excess supply.
The defence industry was particularly developed in the southern districts and
around Mostar, which was also a relevant metallurgical centre (Aluminij
Mostar). Machinery production was concentrated in the north, particularly
around Banja Luka. The Tuzla district was renowned for its chemical industry.
The automotive industry, which developed in the 1950s with the production of
vehicle components, extended later on to passenger and commercial vehicles,
with plants in Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka. Agriculture was not highly
developed, despite its importance for employment and the presence of the large
Agrokomerc conglomerate based at the north-west border with Croatia.

Tito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic
sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a
host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World
brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF.
Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS
Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions
of USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of
income in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly
skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science
experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas.
Before the war, Yugoslav premier Ante Marković, made some preparations for
privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased
development in these actions.

The economy suffered heavily from the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with over
€200 billion in material damages and GDP (excluding services) reduced by 90%
between 1990 and 1995. Today, most of the above-mentioned companies have been
privatised. The economy remains fragile, primarily consumption driven and
vulnerable to external fluctuations. This was seen with the global economic
crisis, which pushed Bosnia and Herzegovina into recession in 2009 and 2012
(with GDP growth of -3% and -0.8%, respectively) and severe floods in 2014,
which caused damage of approximately 15% of GDP. Since 2015, annual GDP growth
has increased to more than 3%. Still, the country registered a current account
deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2017, decreasing from 5.3% in 2015, resulting from a
reduction in its trade deficit, which nevertheless remains large (17.4% of GDP
in 2017).

A Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, debt
negotiations were held with the London Club in December 1997 and with the
Paris Club in October 1998, and a new currency, the Bosnia and Herzegovina
convertible mark, was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark
gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its
reserve holdings. Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the
Bosnian mark to the Euro, inflation has remained low in the entire country.

With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996–99 at high percentage
rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000–02. The country
receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid
from the international community. Support for East European Democracy (SEED)
assistance accounts for 20%-25% of economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the
Federation outpacing the RS.[_clarification needed_] According to World Bank
estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35%
in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the
Federation in 1998.

The movement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in
economic reform since peace was re-established. Banking reform lagged, as did
the implementation of privatization. Many companies (mainly factories) that
were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries
and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons
destroyed those factories.

Sarajevo has a strong tourist industry and was named by Lonely Planet one of
the top 50 "Best Cities in the World" in 2006. Sports-related tourism uses the
legacy facilities of the 1984 Winter Olympics, especially the skiing
facilities on the nearby mountains of Bjelašnica, Igman, Jahorina, Trebević,
and Treskavica. Sarajevo's 600 years of history, influenced by both Western
and Eastern empires, is also a strong tourist attraction. Sarajevo has hosted
travellers for centuries, because it was an important trading center during
the Ottoman and Austria-Hungarian empires.

### Banja Luka

Banja Luka west transit

Although the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian War in the
early 1990s, its economy was. For four years, Banja Luka fell behind the world
in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy.
However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in
importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established
Banja Luka Stock Exchange. The number of companies listed, the trading volume
and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big
companies such as Telekom Srpske, Rafinerija ulja Modriča, Banjalučka Pivara
and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly.
Investors, apart from those from Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, now include a
number of investment funds from the European Union, Norway, the United States,
Japan and China.

A number of financial services regulators, such as the Indirect Taxation
Authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska Securities Commission
and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with
the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency
and the Value-added tax (VAT) Authority are all based in the city, has helped
Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.

In 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.

## Energy

The country has been a heavy user of energy compared with the EU, with
artificially low prices providing a disincentive to make savings. Heavily
reliant on lignite coal for power generation, in 2021 Bosnia and Herzegovina
is one of very few countries still making plans to expand coal energy
generation.

### Renewable power

Wind and Solar

The first wind farm was built in 2018.

The 2030 plan envisages 1.5 GW of solar power and 0.5 GW of wind power
capacity being built.

Hydro power

In 2021 the country had around 2076 MW of installed hydropower capacity larger
than 10 MW, with 180 MW of small hydropower units.

### Fossil fuels

Coal

In 2021, electricity production came from five main lignite coal power plants
generating up to 2065 MW.

Tuzla Thermal Power Plant was supposed to close unit 4 in 2022 however the
government has extended this lignite coal generators life. Kakanj Power
Station was also supposed to have closed unit 5 in 2022 under the 2006 Energy
Community Treaty.

Under the 2030 plan a number of coal power stations will close or convert to
biomass.

## Tourism

Stari Most in Mostar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site

The tourism sector has been recovering and helping the economy altogether in
the process, with popular winter skiing destinations as well as summer
countryside tourism. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a top performer in recent
years in terms of tourism development; tourist arrivals have grown by an
average of 24% annually from 1995 to 2000. The European region's solid growth
in arrivals in 2007 was due in significant part to Southern and Mediterranean
Europe's strong performance (+7%). In particular, Bosnia and Herzegovina were
among the stronger players with a growth of 20%.

In 2012, Bosnia and Herzegovina had 747,827 tourists an increase of 9% and
1,645,521 overnight stays which is a 9,4% increase from 2012. 58.6% of the
tourists came from foreign countries.

According to an estimate of the World Tourism Organization, Bosnia and
Herzegovina will have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world
between 1995 and 2020.

Of particular note is the diaspora population which often returns home during
the summer months, bringing in an increase in retail sales and food service
industry.

In 2017, 1,307,319 tourists visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, an increase of
13.7%, and had 2,677,125 overnight hotel stays, a 12.3% increase from the
previous year. Also, 71.5% of the tourists came from foreign countries.

## Challenges of doing business

While business regulations are of comparable strictness as in most countries
in Central Europe, many problems persist. Post-war high percentage of
unemployment (16.85%) remains high, and the economical progress is very slow.
Complicated bureaucracy system, complex procedures and often misconducted
audition and regulation by public officers also make for volatile and insecure
business environment, which is considered major hindrance to foreign
investment into the country's industrial and manufacturing potential.

The workforce is comparably cheap, with average net salary being €580, and
average gross salary being €891, (as of June 2022[update]) and good skilled,
especially in sectors present in pre-war economy. However, with slow but
persistent know-how obsolescence, workforce exodus, high unemployment and long
average time outside labor market for the unemployed, need a foreign-owned
business investing in industry sectors where the country could be competitive.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is also lacking a good e-governance structure, as well
as good methods to enforce administrative accountability, both of which are
considered necessary for more conductive business climate. Today[_when?_] it
takes between 3–5 weeks to register a company in the country (and in some
business sectors it can still take months to acquire all required permits,
mostly due to administrative inefficiency), and many other business related
administrative procedures are similarly convoluted and time-consuming.

Political corruption is one of the more acute problems in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and along with size of administration and its inefficiency, the
biggest detriment to tax money being spent where it should be spent – on
services to the population and the economy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has been preparing for an era of declining
international assistance. Country's most immediate task remains economic
revitalization to create jobs and income. After the 2014 riots, both
administrations have shyly started the reform, dealing with some of the many
pressing issues to local economy, but the overall process is still considered
slow and tenuous by the populace and local as well as foreign economic
analysts.

## Infrastructure

Motorway on the Pan-European Corridor Vc between Sarajevo and Visoko

The Bosnian government has issued an international tender for the construction
of the 350 km long Pan-European Corridor Vc in Bosnia and Herzegovina which
will passes along the route Budapest-Osijek-Sarajevo-Ploče. The highway along
this corridor is the most significant roadway in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
the shortest communication route between Central Europe and the Southern
Adriatic. The routing of the road passes through the central part of the
country in the north–south direction from Donji Svilaj to the border of B&H,
north from the Croatian port of Ploče, following the rivers Bosna and Neretva.
More than 50% of the total population and the economic activity of Bosnia and
Herzegovina lies within the zone of influence along this route.

As of August 2018, 200 km of the motorway has been completed.

Due to annual growth of nearly 10% the Sarajevo International Airport
extension of the passenger terminal, together with upgrading and expanding the
taxiway and apron is planned to start in Fall 2012. The existing terminal will
be expanded with 7.000 square metres. The upgraded airport will also be
directly connected to the commercial retail center Sarajevo Airport Center
making it easy for tourist and travellers to use the time before the flight
for some last minute shopping.
