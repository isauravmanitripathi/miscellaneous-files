The economy of Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on its petroleum sector. Oil
accounts for approximately 30% of Saudi GDP and 55% of government revenue,
with substantial fluctuations depending on oil prices each year.

The kingdom has the second-largest proven petroleum reserves, and the fourth-
largest measured natural gas reserves. Saudi Arabia is currently the largest
exporter of petroleum in the world. Other major parts of the economy include
refining and chemical manufacturing from the oil reserves, much of which is
vertically integrated in the state-owned enterprise, Saudi Aramco. Saudi
Arabia is a permanent and founding member of OPEC.

In 2016, the Saudi government launched its Saudi Vision 2030 program to reduce
its dependency on oil and diversify its economic resources. By 2022, Saudi
Arabia had only modestly reduced its dependence on oil.

Monetary policy in Saudi Arabia is anchored by the fixed exchange rate of the
Saudi Riyal to the U.S. Dollar.

Nearly every major business in Saudi Arabia has extensive ties to the Saudi
state.

## Economic overview

Saudi oil reserves are the second largest in the world (after
Brazilian–Venezuelan oil reserves), and Saudi Arabia is the world's leading
oil exporter and second-largest oil producer. Proven reserves, according to
figures provided by the Saudi government, are estimated to be 260 billion
barrels (41 km3), which is about one-quarter of the world oil reserves.
Petroleum in Saudi Arabia is not only plentiful but also located under
pressure close to the earth's surface, which makes it less expensive and more
profitable to extract compared to other places. The petroleum sector accounts
for roughly 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of
GDP. Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and production are largely managed by the
state-owned corporation Saudi Aramco.

Another 40% of the GDP comes from the private sector. An estimated 7.5 (2013)
million foreigners work legally in Saudi Arabia and play a crucial role in
developing the Saudi economy, for example in the oil and service sectors. The
government has been encouraging the growth of the private sector for many
years to decrease the kingdom's dependence on oil and to increase employment
opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. In recent decades, the
government started allowing private sector activity and foreign investor
participation in certain sectors, such as power generation and
telecommunications, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. During much
of the 2000s, high oil prices allowed the government to post budget surpluses
and boost spending on job training and education, infrastructure development,
and government salaries.

With its absolute monarchy, large state sector, and supply of welfare
benefits, the Saudi economy has been described asː

> A bewildering (at least to outsiders) combination of a feudal fealty system
> and a more modern political patronage one. At every level in every sphere of
> activity, Saudis maneuver through life manipulating individual privileges,
> favours, obligations, and connections. By the same token, the government
> bureaucracy is a maze of overlapping or conflicting power centers under the
> patronage of various royal princes with their own priorities and agendas to
> pursue and dependents to satisfy.

## History

Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, the day the well struck oil in commercial
quantities, becoming the first in the kingdom to do so

Saudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. In 1933, the Saudi
government signed an oil concession agreement with the Standard Oil Company of
California; five years later, commercial volumes of oil were discovered in the
kingdom. The development of oil fields continued in Saudi Arabia, managed
mainly by Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), a company formed by the
partnership of Texaco and Chevron. In 1951, the first offshore field in the
Middle East was established by Aramco at Raʾs Al-Saffāniyyah area. By 1949,
Saudi oil production reached 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rose rapidly to
1 million bpd in 1954. Moreover, in 1951, Aramco started operating the Trans-
Arabian Pipeline that moved oil from the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to the
Mediterranean Sea through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, in 1981, this
line was no longer used after a new line began operations that linked Jubail
on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea. The new pipe contributed greatly
to speed up oil transport. In 1960, OPEC was established, with Saudi Arabia as
one of its founding members. During the 1973 oil crisis, the price of oil rose
from $3 per barrel to nearly $12, and the Saudi economy started growing
rapidly, with GDP increasing from approximately $15 billion in 1973 to almost
$184 billion by 1981. After gradually purchasing Aramco assets, the Saudi
government nationalized the company in 1980. In 1988, Saudi Aramco was
established to take over the responsibilities of Aramco.

In 1980, the price of oil peaked, and demand started decreasing as a result of
recessions in industrialized nations and more efficient oil use, which
produced surpluses. This created a worldwide oil glut, with the price of oil
dropping from approximately $36 per barrel in 1980 to approximately $14 by
1986. Saudi oil production, which had increased to almost 10 million barrels
(1,600,000 m3) per day during 1980–81, fell 80% to about 2 million barrels per
day (320,000 m3/d) in 1985. Budgetary deficits developed, and the government
drew down its foreign assets. As a result of the oil glut and the pressure
from declines in production, after 1985 Saudi Arabia started enforcing
production quotas more harshly for the OPEC members.

In June 1993, Saudi Aramco absorbed the state marketing and refining company
(SAMAREC), becoming the world's largest fully integrated oil company. Most
Saudi oil is exported by tankers from oil terminals at Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah
in the Persian Gulf.

In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil
revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income
fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in
1998. Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the
kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed
to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010. Increases in oil prices in the early
2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400
adjusted for inflation), but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.

However, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low
oil prices. Because of a combination of factors—the East Asian economic
crises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Niño, and an increase in non-
OPEC oil production—demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by
more than one-third.

Saudi Arabia was a key player in coordinating the successful 1999 campaign of
OPEC and other oil-producing countries to raise the oil price to its highest
level since the (Persian) Gulf War by managing petroleum supply and
production. That same year, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic
Council to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies to
accelerate institutional and industrial reforms.

Saudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005 after many
years of negotiations.

### Foreign investment

Before 2000, there were strict limits placed on foreign direct investment in
Saudi Arabia. The 1979 Foreign Investment Act prohibited foreign ownership in
some sectors of the economy, allowed foreign investment only if the investor
qualified for a license based on their expertise, and gave priority to
businesses that were Saudi-owned or partially Saudi-owned.

However, in the mid-1990s, foreign ownership rules were relaxed, with
investment sought in telecommunications, utilities, and financial services.
The 2000 Foreign Direct Investment Act made substantial changes to the rules
on foreign investment, including allowing projects to be run by 100% foreign-
owned companies for the first time.

According to UNCTAD's June 2018 report, Saudi Arabia's foreign direct
investment was only $1.4 billion in 2017, down from $7.5 billion the year
before and as much as $12.2 billion in 2012. The fall in investment is
attributed to negative intra-company loans by foreign multinationals and
various divestments. In the first quarter of 2018, net capital outflows were
running at approximately 5% of GDP, compared to less than 2% of GDP in late
2016. However, according to a report published in Trading Economics, in the
second quarter of 2018, foreign direct investment in the country raised by
$882 million. Moreover, SAGIA's data indicate that licenses provided to
foreign investment increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2018 as a result
of reforms in the economy.

As Saudi oil income declined in the late 2010s, the kingdom's international
debt soared. In December 2018, Saudi Arabia announced it would be issuing
bonds worth approximately 120 billion riyals ($32 billion) to cover its 4.2%
GDP deficit of 131 billion riyals. In January 2019, the kingdom sold bonds
worth $7.5 billion. In almost two and a half years, bonds worth $60 billion
were sold by Saudi, which became one of the biggest borrowers globally.

In September 2018, the Public Investment Fund completed a deal with a group of
global lenders for a loan of $11 billion. The deal raised more than initially
planned and was the first time the PIF had incorporated loans and debt
instruments into its funding. According to data from Fitch Ratings, over two
years starting from May 2016 Saudi Arabia went from having zero debt to
raising $68 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and syndicated loans—one of
the fastest rates among emerging economies.

Foreign investments in the kingdom witnessed a rapid increase in the first
quarter of 2019. The number of new licenses approved for foreign businesses
grew 70% over 2018. Most licenses were approved for British and Chinese
companies, which drove the increase. In the first quarter of 2019, foreign
investment in Saudi Arabia jumped by 28%.

### Diversification and the development plans

All the Saudi government's five-year plan since 1970 have called for
diversifying the economy beyond oil, but with marginal success.

The government has sought to allocate its petroleum income to transform its
relatively undeveloped, oil-based economy into a modern industrial state,
while maintaining the kingdom's traditional Islamic values and customs.
Although economic planners have not achieved all their goals, the economy has
progressed rapidly. Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most
Saudis. However, significant population growth has strained the government's
ability to finance further improvements in the country's standard of living.
Heavy dependence on petroleum revenue continues, but industry and agriculture
now account for a larger share of economic activity. The mismatch between the
job skills of Saudi graduates and the needs of the private job market at all
levels remains the principal obstacle to economic diversification and
development; about 4.6 million non-Saudis are employed in the economy.

Saudi Arabia first began to diversify its economy to reduce dependency on oil
in the 1970s as part of its first five-year development plan. Basic
petrochemical industries using petroleum byproducts as feedstock were
developed. The fishing villages of al-Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on
the Red Sea were developed. However, their effect on Saudi Arabia's economic
fortunes has been small.

Saudi Arabia's first two development plans, covering the 1970s, emphasized
infrastructure. The results were impressive—the total length of paved highways
tripled, power generation increased by a factor of 28, and the capacity of the
seaports grew by a factor of 10. For the third plan (1980–85), the emphasis
changed. Spending on infrastructure declined, shifting instead to education,
health, and social services. The share for diversifying and expanding
productive sectors of the economy (primary industry) did not rise as planned,
but the two industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu—which were built around the
use of the country's oil and gas to produce steel, petrochemicals, fertilizer,
and refined oil products—were largely completed.

In the fourth plan (1985–90), the country's basic infrastructure was viewed as
largely complete, but education and training remained areas of concern.
Private enterprise was encouraged, and foreign investment in the form of joint
ventures with Saudi public and private companies was welcomed. The private
sector became more important, rising to 70% of non-oil GDP by 1987. While
still concentrated in trade and commerce, private investment increased in
industry, agriculture, banking, and construction companies. These private
investments were supported by generous government financing and incentive
programs. The objective was for the private sector to have 70% to 90%
ownership in most joint venture enterprises.

The fifth plan (1990–95) emphasized consolidation of the country's defences;
improved and more efficient government social services; regional development;
and, most importantly, creating greater private-sector employment
opportunities for Saudis by reducing the number of foreign workers.

The sixth plan (1996–2000) focused on lowering the cost of government services
without cutting them and sought to expand educational training programs. The
plan called for reducing the kingdom's dependence on the petroleum sector by
diversifying economic activity, particularly in the private sector, with
special emphasis on industry and agriculture. It also continued the effort to
"Saudize" the labour force.

The seventh plan (2000–2004) focused more on economic diversification and a
greater role of the private sector in the Saudi economy. For 2000–04, the
government aimed at an average GDP growth rate of 3.16% each year, with
projected growths of 5.04% for the private sector and 4.01% for the non-oil
sector. The government also set a target of creating 817,300 new jobs for
Saudi nationals. By 2007, advertising expenditures had reached new peaks due
to emphasis on value-added manufacturing.[_failed verification_]

In 2016, the main investing countries in Saudi Arabia were the US, UAE,
France, Singapore, Kuwait, and Malaysia. They mainly invested in chemical
industry, real estate, tourism, fossil fuels, automobiles, and machinery. As
part of its diversification, Saudi Arabia arranged major refinery contracts
with Chinese and other companies.

After Saudi Arabia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in
2005, the overall foreign investment environment in Saudi Arabia improved
thanks to the kingdom's stable economy, massive oil reserves, high power of
expenditure, developed infrastructure, reinforced finance, and banking system.
Since then, and pursuant to its commitment to the WTO, Saudi Arabia has been
developing trade-related policies and legislations. Moreover, foreign
investment has been highly encouraged by Saudi Vision 2030 and its economic
diversification.

Since 2017, to boost the economy and decrease the country's dependency on oil,
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced multiple changes, such as
raising the prices of gasoline and electricity, levying new taxes, and
prioritizing Saudi workers over foreign workers. However, some government
officials claimed the policies were causing serious ill effects on the
economy. Saudi businessmen reported a decline in sales for 2018, and a few
blamed the government.

In 2019, the _Financial Times_ reported that the plans to float state-owned
oil beneficiary Saudi Aramco were stranded between the company's attachment to
the oil ministry and the desire to meet international standards. However,
Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih has long maintained that Aramco's association
with the state is a "win-win policy" for both parties.

Saudi Arabia made plans to launch six "economic cities" (e.g., King Abdullah
Economic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs. At a
total construction cost of $60 billion (2013), they were "expected to
contribute $150bn to the economy". However, these cities have failed to
attract either the population or the financial investment that the government
claimed they would.

The privatization program Saudi Vision 2030 is running behind schedule. Oil
prices have doubled since the government began to consider the program in
2015. Delay in Aramco's initial public offering further demonstrated a lack of
urgency to privatize, even though in July 2018, the International Monetary
Fund urged accelerating the process.

According to many reports, the Saudi government is interested in granting more
liberties to the foreign investment system and giving a 100% allowance to
foreign investors to work in the wholesale and retail sector in certain cases.
The Saudi Ministry of Commerce and Investment expected that the kingdom would
see an increase in the GDP per capita from US$20,700 to $33,500 by 2020.
However, the GDP per capita by 2020 had stagnated at $US20,000.

## Employment

As of 2008, roughly two-thirds of workers employed in Saudi Arabia were
foreigners, and in the private sector the proportion was approximately 90%. In
January 2014, the Saudi government claimed it had lowered the 90% rate,
doubling the number of Saudi citizens working in the private sector to 1.5
million (compared to 10 million foreign expatriates working in the kingdom).

According to Reuters, economists "estimate only 30–40 percent of working-age
Saudis hold jobs or actively seek work", although the official unemployment
rate is only around 12 percent. Most Saudis with jobs are employed by the
government, but the International Monetary Fund has warned that the government
cannot support such a large payroll in the long term. The government has
announced a succession of plans since 2000 to deal with the imbalance by
"Saudization" of the economy, but the foreign workforce and unemployment has
continued to grow. Since the beginning of 2017, however, Saudi Arabia has seen
record numbers of foreign workers leaving the country as the Saudi government
imposed higher fees on expatriate workers, with more than 677,000 foreigners
leaving the kingdom. This has done little to lower the unemployment rate,
which rose to 12.9 percent, the highest on record.

Each year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the
first phase of Saudization into effect, 70% of sales jobs are expected to be
filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated
by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more
than a decade. According to a report published by Bloomberg Economics in 2018,
the government needs to produce 700000 jobs by 2020 to meet its 9%
unemployment target.

One obstacle is social resistance to certain types of employment. Jobs in
service and sales are considered totally unacceptable for citizens of Saudi
Arabia—both to potential employees and customers.

## Non-petroleum resources sector

Saudi Arabia has natural resources other than oil, including small mineral
deposits of gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, manganese, tungsten, lead,
sulfur, phosphate, soapstone, and feldspar. The country has a small
agricultural sector, primarily in the southwest where annual rainfall averages
400 mm (16 in). The country is one of the world's largest producers of dates.
Prior to 2009, wheat was grown using desalinated water for irrigation, but was
phased out by 2016 due to costly water usage. As of 2009, the livestock
population amounted to 7.4 million sheep, 4.2 million goats, half a million
camels, and a quarter of a million cattle.

Although the jobs created by the roughly two million annual Hajj pilgrims do
not last long, they employ more people than the oil industry—40,000 temporary
jobs (butchers, barbers, coach drivers, etc.)—and generates US$2–3 billion in
revenue.

In 2008, the "Initiative for Saudi Agricultural Investment Abroad" was
launched, leading to extensive billion-dollar purchases of large tracts of
land around the world, including in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mali, Senegal, and
Sudan. Described as land-grabbing by critics, in various instances these
purchases have also led to uproars in the respective countries. Competing
industrializing nations with food security problems seeking agricultural land
include China, South Korea, and India, as well as the Persian Gulf States of
Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE.

## Automotive

KSU Gazal-1

In 2010, the KSU Gazal-1, an SUV built by students at King Saud University,
became the first mass-produced vehicle manufactured domestically in Saudi
Arabia. In 2022, the US car company Lucid Motors announced plans to build an
electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Jeddah. Construction began in May
2022, and the plant will have capacity for 150,000 vehicles.

Toyota is the leading brand in Saudi Arabia, accounting for 30% of car sales
in the country; they are followed by Kia and Hyundai who together make up 26%,
and Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi at 9%. The American Big Three auto makers (Ford,
GM, and Chrysler) comprise the remainder. As for the quantity of vehicle units
sold, in the first half of 2023, Toyota had the highest in the country with
112,584 and the second-most was the Hyundai badge with 47,218.

## Private sector

Saudi Arabia's private sector is dominated by a handful of big businesses in
the service sector, primarily in construction and real estate, such as Olayan,
Zamil, Almarai, Mobily, STC, SABIC, Sadara, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Flynas,
Hilton, Zain, Yanbu Cement, Alhokair, MBC, Mahfouz, Al Rajhi, and Alfanar.
These firms are "heavily dependent on government spending", which is dependent
on oil revenues.

From 2003 to 2013, "several key services" were privatized—municipal water
supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health
care, traffic control, and car accident reporting were also privatized.
According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, "in almost every one
of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance
of these privatized entities."

A relatively small sector until a boom in the 1980s, the food service industry
in Saudi Arabia today is valued at around $13 billion.

To provide the best support for the private sector and entrepreneurs, the
kingdom announced a decision approved by the Saudi Cabinet in July 2019
allowing businesses in the country to be given the option to remain open 24
hours a day. As of 2023, the average monthly salary for Saudis working in the
private sector is SR9600, up 45% from SR6600 in the year 2018.

## Trade

Saudi Arabian exports in 2006

In April 2000, the government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment
Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia
maintains a negative list of sectors in which foreign investment is
prohibited, but the government planned to open some closed sectors such as
telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.

Saudi Arabia became a full World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 11
December 2005. In 2019, the government established the General Authority for
Foreign Trade to enhance the kingdom's international commercial and investment
activities.

In early July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced the nomination of its former
Minister of Economy and Saudi royal court adviser, Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri, for
the role of WTO's director-general. The nominations were made public about a
month after the WTO reported the kingdom for copyrights infringement following
distribution of pirated sports broadcasting content on the state-owned
broadcast service, BeoutQ. The nomination of al-Tuwaijri received criticism
from human rights groups in mid-August 2020, demanding the rejection of the
Saudi nominee due to the kingdom's violation of human rights in addition to
his silence over it. On 7 October 2020, Al-Tuwaijri, along with other nominees
from the UK and Kenya, lost the bid for the role due to lack of support, as
compared to the nominees from Nigeria and South Korea who qualified for the
final round of selection.

Saudi Arabia is part of the following trade organizations:

  * World Trade Organization (WTO)
  * International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  * International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)
  * International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  * World Customs Organization (WCO)

## Challenges

Among the challenges to the Saudi economy include halting or reversing the
decline in per capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the
workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy,
stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing
corruption and inequality. In answer to the question of why the Saudi economy
is so dependent on foreign labor, the UN Arab Human Development Report blamed
stunted social and economic development inhibited by lack of personal freedom,
poor education, government hiring based on factors other than merit, and the
exclusion of women.

### Income drop

Despite possessing the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, per
capita income dropped from approximately $18,000 at the height of the oil boom
(1981) to $7,000 in 2001, according to one estimate. As of 2013, due to the
rapid population growth of Saudi Arabia, per capita income in Saudi was "a
fraction of that of smaller Persian gulf neighbors", even less than petroleum-
poor Bahrain.

Unlike most developed countries, where GDP growth is a function of increases
in productivity and inputs such as employment, in Saudi Arabia the fluctuation
of oil prices is the most important factor in the growth or decline of
domestic production. "Saudi reserves are steadily being depleted, and no
significant new discoveries have been found to replace them," according to
Middle East journalist Karen House.[_as of?_] Saudi population grew sevenfold
from 1960 to 2010, and petrol prices are subsidized and cost users less than
equivalent quantities of bottled water. With production stagnant, growth in
population and domestic energy consumption means a decline in per capita
income unless oil prices rise to match that growth.

After 2015, Saudi Arabia embarked on several initiatives, including Vision
2030, aimed at reducing its dependency on oil by investing in other sectors
such as tourism, entertainment, and technology. [] . Despite a decline in oil
GDP, Saudi Arabia's GDP is expected to grow due to the increase in non-oil
GDP. In the second quarter of 2024, Saudi Arabia's GDP contracted by 0.4%
year-on-year, primarily due to an 8.5% decline in oil-related activities.
However, non-oil activities grew by 4.4%, contributing to a seasonally
adjusted growth of 1.4% compared to the previous quarter.

As of 2024, Saudi Arabia's GDP per capita has surpassed all other GCC
countries except Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia's GDP per
capita is estimated to be approximately $33,040 in nominal terms, ranking it
35th globally, and $70,333 in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, ranking it
as the 15th highest in the world []

### Demographics

The Saudi population is young. About 51% of the total population are under the
age of 25 (as of February 2012). According to a 2013 report by the
International Monetary Fund, up to 1.6 million young nationals of the Persian
Gulf countries (of which Saudi Arabia is the largest) will enter the workforce
from 2013 to 2018, but the economies of those countries will have jobs in the
private sector for less than half (approximately 600,000).

### Education

According to _The Economist_ , the Saudi government has attempted in past
years to raise employment by forcing "companies to fill at least 30% of their
positions" with Saudi citizens. However, "employers complained bitterly about
the lack of skills among young locals; years of rote-learning and religious
instruction fail to prepare them for the job market." However, many argue that
young Saudis couldn't compete with foreigners due to the low compensation and
salaries most companies had used to offer for employees from Asian, Indian
subcontinent, and other Arab poor countries, which this cheap labor happily
accepts; in addition to the bad work conditions, culture, and environment
present in most of the Saudi private sector, largely due to the fact that it
was initially modeled to accommodate very-low-income employees from other
nations, not the Saudi medium-income and somewhat highly educated population.
As a consequence, "the quota has now been dropped and replaced with a more
flexible system".

According to scholar David Commins, the kingdom depends "on huge numbers of
expatriate workers to fill technical and administrative positions" in part
because of an educational system that, despite "generous budgets", has
suffered from "poorly trained teachers, low retention rates, lack of rigorous
standards, weak scientific and technical instruction and excessive attention
to religious subjects".

A 2015 survey conducted by Bayt.com showed that over a quarter (28%) of
professionals in North Africa and the Middle East believe that there is a
skills shortage in their country of residence. This belief was even more
prominent among respondents in Saudi Arabia (39%).

### Innovation

Saudi has not been a hotbed of technological innovation. The number of Saudi
patents registered in the United States between 1977 and 2010 came to 382—less
than twelve per year—compared to 84,840 patents for South Korea or 20,620 for
Israel during that period. However, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was granted 664
patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, ranking 23rd among
92 countries. The number of granted patents was double that of all Arab
countries combined during the same period.

### Bureaucracy

Business journalist Karen House criticized the Saudi bureaucracy, explaining
that someone seeking to start a business in Saudi Arabia:

> has to complete innumerable applications and documents at multiple layers of
> multiple ministries, which invariably requires seeking favours from various
> patronage networks and accumulating obligations along the way, most probably
> including having to hire less-than-competent dependents of his patrons.
> Then, for any business of any size, government contracts, not private
> competition, are the financial lifeblood. So this means more patrons, more
> favours, and more obligations. Not surprisingly, Saudi businesses that can
> compete outside the protected Saudi market are few.

### Corruption

The cost of maintaining the Royal Family is estimated by some to be about
US$10 billion per year.

A 2005 survey by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce found that 77% of businessmen
polled felt they had to 'bypass' the law to conduct their operations. By 2012,
"businessmen say it has only gotten worse". Saudi Arabia has been severely
criticized for failing to tackle money laundering and international terrorism
financing. A report released by the Financial Action Task Force on 24
September 2018, says, "Saudi Arabia is not effectively investigating and
prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale or professional [money
laundering] activity" and is "not effectively confiscating the proceeds of
crime".

### Poverty

Estimates of the number of Saudis below the poverty line range from between
12.7% and 25%. Press reports and private estimates as of 2013 "suggest that
between 2 million and 4 million" of the country's native Saudis live on "less
than about $530 a month" – about $17 a day – considered the poverty line in
Saudi Arabia.

  
According to UNESCWA Oman and Saudi Arabia have the highest poverty rates
among GCC nations, at 10.1% and 13.6% respectively and Saudi Arabia saw a
notable decline in poverty from 18.2% in 2010 to 13.6% in 2021.

The Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty.
In December 2011, days after the Arab Spring uprisings, the Saudi interior
ministry detained reporter Feros Boqna and two colleagues (Hussam al-Drewesh
and Khaled al-Rasheed) and held them for almost two weeks for questioning
after they uploaded a 10-minute video on the topic (_Mal3ob 3alena_ , or 'We
are being cheated') to YouTube. Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis
are considered to be poor (2009) and 70% of Saudis do not own their houses.
Statistics on the issue are not available through the UN resources because the
Saudi government does not issue poverty figures. Observers researching the
issue prefer to stay anonymous because of the risk of being arrested, like
Feras Boqna.

### Housing

50% of Saudi Arabia's citizens owned their own home in 2017, a rise from 30%
in 2011 but below the international average rate of 70%. In 2011, analysts
estimated 500,000 new homes per year were needed to match the growth in Saudi
population, but as of early 2014 only 300,000 to 400,000 houses per year were
being built.

One problem is that the government Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)—which
provides 81% of all loans for housing—had an 18-year waiting list for loans
due to pent-up demand. Another is that the REDF's maximum loan is 500,000 SR
($133,000), while in 2012 the average price for a small free-standing home in
Riyadh is more than double that—1.23 million SR ($328,000). However, as part
of the economic reforms undertaken by the government to enhance national
living standards, new funding solutions have been established to boost the
mortgages for existing and new borrowers to help finance their housing plans.
This was announced in August 2018 by the Minister of Housing, Mr. Majed Al-
Hogail.

A major reason for the high cost of housing is the high cost of land. In urban
areas, the price of land has been bid up because nearly all of it is owned by
the Saudi elite (members of the royal family or other wealthy Saudis), who
have lobbied the government for land "giveaways". Landlords have seen prices
rocket by 50% from 2011 to 2013. The owners benefit from these price increases
as they hold the land for future development. To deal with the key "land
banking" issue, the Minister of Housing suggested in 2013 that vacant property
within city limits could be subject to a tax. However, no firm plans for any
tax have been unveiled.

### Private sector growth

In 2018, the imposition of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) brought private-sector
growth to a halt. Consumer spending was also restrained after a sharp increase
in prices for energy, electricity, and water earlier in 2018. The kingdom
witnessed a mass departure of around 750,000 foreign workers after imposing
new government levies on ex-pat workers. The government is also forcing small-
business owners to hire Saudi nationals at comparatively higher wages than
foreign workers. Gaining money from large, direct foreign investments is also
not working in favor of the government. Rich Saudis are reluctant to invest
within the kingdom due to the fear of triggering government scrutiny.

On 11 May 2020, the government announced that it would triple the kingdom's
VAT on goods and services, raising it from 5% to 15%. It also stated that the
increase in VAT—introduced due to the country's current financial crisis due
to plummeting oil prices and impact of coronavirus—would also be followed by a
cut in monthly allowance for state workers worth approximately $266, and
financial benefits for contractors. Aramco decreased the production of its
Arab Light grade of crude oil by a significant amount[_by how much?_] to be
shipped to Asia. The firm also cut down oil pricing for its US buyers
following wavering demand for fuel due to the global relapse of the
coronavirus pandemic.

According to the General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia's inflation
accelerated to 6.2% in August 2020, as compared to the same month last year.
The report states that the annual inflation rate increased from only 0.5% (in
June) to 6.1% (in July), before the increase of VAT to 15% from 5% was
introduced, effective from 1 July 2020.

## Investment

Saudi Arabia has two stock exchanges, the Tadawul and The Saudi Parallel
Market (Nomu), whose financial markets are regulated by the Capital Market
Authority. The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Saudi Arabia
is valued at $2.22 trillion. According to the International Institute for
Management Development, Saudi Arabia experienced the largest improvement in
business competitiveness of all countries in 2019; the kingdom rose 13 places
to 26th in the world.

### Doing business

Saudi Arabia is among the countries with the most notable improvement in doing
business, according to the World Bank Group's "Doing Business" 2020 report.
The country jumped 30 places to rank 62nd in ease of doing business, compared
to the previous year. Previously, the kingdom had been declining in the
overall rankings, from 22nd in 2013 to 92nd in 2018.

According to the World Bank in 2019, Saudi Arabia had conducted reforms in
eight areas of business: (1) starting a business, (2) getting construction
permits, (3) getting electricity, (4) getting credit, (5) protecting minority
investors, (6) trading across borders, (7) enforcing contracts, and (8)
resolving insolvency.

Saudi Arabian companies dominate 2009's "MEED 100", with companies listed on
the Tadawul accounting for 29 out of the region's 100 biggest publicly quoted
companies ranked by market capitalization. Just three of the 20 companies that
have dropped out of the top 100 over the past year are listed on the Saudi
stock exchange.

Foreigners are allowed to wholly own limited liability companies in the
majority of industries. Non-Saudi nationals are required to obtain a foreign
capital investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment
Authority.

With a total of 291 foreign investor licenses issued in the second quarter of
2019, the kingdom has witnessed an increase in international investment,
reflecting the economic reforms under the Saudi Vision 2030. Obtaining a
foreign investor license became more straightforward as it requires only two
documents, and it is processed in three hours.

### Companies

#### Saudi Aramco

Saudi Aramco (officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.) is Saudi Arabia's national
oil, petroleum, and natural gas company headquartered in Dhahran. Saudi Aramco
was listed for public trading on 10 December 2019 and had a valuation as of
US$2 trillion as of 12 December 2019.

Saudi Aramco has both the second largest proven crude oil reserves, which it
claims to be more than 260 billion barrels (4.1×1010 m3), and the largest
daily oil production. The company operates the world's largest single
hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. Its yearly production is 3.479
billion barrels (553,100,000 m3), and it manages over 100 oil and gas fields
in Saudi Arabia, including 284.8 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural
gas reserves. Saudi Aramco owns the Ghawar Field, the world's largest oil
field, and the Shaybah Field, another one of the world's largest oil fields.

On 16 November 2020, Saudi Aramco announced hiring banks to sell dollar-
denominated bonds with the aim of improving finances after the coronavirus
pandemic caused a sharp fall in the global demand for crude oil. Aramco's
multi-tranche offer was set to run between 3 and 50 years, depending on the
market conditions. The banks hired for the transaction included Citi Bank,
Goldman Sachs International, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and NCB Capital.
Other banks involved in the deal included BNP Paribas, BOC International, BofA
Securities, Credit Agricole, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC Nikko
and Societe Generale.

In 2021, Saudi Aramco made a net-income of 95.5 billion riyals ($25.5 billion)
in the second quarter alone, which was the highest level since 2018.

#### SABIC

The Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) was established by a
royal decree in 1976 to produce chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. In 2008,
SABIC was Asia's largest (in terms of market capitalization) and most
profitable publicly listed non-oil company, the world's fourth-largest
petrochemical company, the second-largest producer of ethylene glycol and
methanol in the world, the third-largest producer of polyethylene and overall
the fourth-largest producer of polypropylene and polyolefin. It ranked 186th
as the world's largest corporation on the Fortune Global 500 for 2009.
Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings claimed SABIC to be the world's largest
producer of polymers and the Persian Gulf region's largest steel producer for
2005 and assigned SABIC an "A" corporate credit rating. In 2008, Fortune 500
ranking records SABIC revenues at $40.2 billion, profits at $5.8 billion, and
assets standing at $72.4 billion.

#### Ma'aden (company)

Ma'aden was formed as a Saudi joint stock company on 23 March 1997 for the
purpose of facilitating the development of Saudi Arabia's mineral resources.
Ma'aden's activities have focused on its active gold business which has grown
in recent years to include the operation of five gold mines: Mahd Ad Dahab, Al
Hajar, Sukhaybarat, Bulghah, and Al Amar. Ma'aden is now expanding its
activities beyond its gold business with the development of phosphates,
aluminium, and other projects. In addition, since its formation, Ma'aden
(through the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources) has collaborated
with the government and local legislators to develop a regulatory framework
for the governance of the mining industry.
