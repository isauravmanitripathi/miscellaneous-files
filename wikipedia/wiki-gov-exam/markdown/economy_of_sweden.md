Historical development of real GDP per capita in Sweden

The **economy of Sweden** is a highly developed export-oriented economy, aided
by timber, hydropower, and iron ore. These constitute the resource base of an
economy oriented toward foreign trade. The main industries include motor
vehicles, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, industrial machines, precision
equipment, chemical goods, home goods and appliances, forestry, iron, and
steel. Traditionally, Sweden relied on a modern agricultural economy that
employed over half the domestic workforce. Today, Sweden further develops
engineering, mine, steel, and pulp industries, which are competitive
internationally, as evidenced by companies such as Ericsson, ASEA/ABB, SKF,
Alfa Laval, AGA, and Dyno Nobel.

Sweden is a competitive open mixed economy. The vast majority of Swedish
enterprises are privately owned and market-oriented. There is also a strong
welfare state, with public-sector spending accounting up to three-fifths of
GDP. In 2014, the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%.

Due to Sweden being one of the neutral powers during World War II, it did not
have to rebuild its economic base, the banking system, and country as a whole,
as did many other European countries. Sweden has achieved a high standard of
living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare
benefits. Sweden has the second highest total tax revenue behind Denmark, as a
share of the country's income. As of 2012[update], the total tax revenue was
44.2% of GDP, down from 48.3% in 2006.

In 2014 the National Institute of Economic research predicted GDP growth of
1.8%, 3.1% and 3.4% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.[_needs update_] A
comparison of upcoming economic growth rates of European Union countries
revealed that the Baltic states, Poland, and Slovakia are the only countries
that are expected to keep comparable or higher growth rates.

## History

In the 19th century Sweden evolved from a largely agricultural economy into
the beginnings of an industrialized, urbanized country. Poverty remained
widespread, prompting a large portion of the country to emigrate, mainly to
the United States. Economic reforms and the creation of a modern economic
system, banks and corporations were enacted during the later half of the 19th
century. During that time Sweden was in a way the "powerhouse" of the
Scandinavian region with a strong industrialization process commencing in the
1860s. Moreover, the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active
Parliament already during the _Age of Liberty_ (1719–72), and this tradition
continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition
towards modern democracy at the end of said century. Apart from relatively
high levels of human capital formation, the result of the Reformation and
related government policies, such local democratic traditions were the other
asset that made the "catching up" of the Scandinavian countries, including
Sweden, possible and this economic rise was probably the most remarkable
phenomenon in that region during the nineteenth century.

By the 1930s, Sweden had what _Life_ magazine called in 1938 the "world's
highest standard of living". Sweden declared itself neutral during both world
wars, thereby avoiding much physical destruction and instead, especially after
the First World War, profiting from the new circumstances – such as booming
demand for raw materials and foodstuffs and the disappearance of international
competition for its exports. The postwar boom, that was the continuation of
strong inflationary tendencies during the war itself, propelled Sweden to
greater economic prosperity. Beginning in the 1970s and culminating with the
deep recession of the early 1990s, Swedish standards of living developed less
favorably than many other industrialized countries. Since the mid-1990s, the
economic performance has improved.[_citation needed_]

In 2009, Sweden had the world's tenth highest GDP per capita in nominal terms
and was in 14th place in terms of purchasing power parity.

### Crisis of the 1990s

Sweden has had an economic model in the post-World War II era characterized by
close cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The
Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high
taxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble
formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax
system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international
economic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990
and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst
economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published
in _Computer Sweden_ in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for
information technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and
banking sector, the part of the industry that created the crisis. The
investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992
there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest
to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange
rate. Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.

A real estate boom ended in a bust. The government took over nearly a quarter
of banking assets at a cost of about 4% of the nation's GDP. This was known
colloquially as the "Stockholm Solution". In 2007, the United States Federal
Reserve noted, "In the early 1970s, Sweden had one of the highest income
levels in Europe; today, its lead has all but disappeared...So, even well-
managed financial crises don't really have a happy ending".

The welfare system that had been growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be
sustained with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In
1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. The response of the
government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve
Sweden's competitiveness. When the international economic outlook improved
combined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well
positioned to capitalize on, the country was able to emerge from the crisis.

The crisis of the 1990s was by some viewed as the end of the much buzzed
welfare model called "Svenska modellen", literally "The Swedish Model", as it
proved that governmental spending at the levels previously experienced in
Sweden was not long-term sustainable in a global open economy. Much of the
Swedish Model's acclaimed advantages actually had to be viewed as a result of
the post WWII special situation, which left Sweden untouched when competitors'
economies were comparatively weak.

However, the reforms enacted during the 1990s seem to have created a model in
which extensive welfare benefits can be maintained in a global economy.

In recent years, the Swedish welfare state model has been weakened. Massive
privatizations have been carried out since the 1990s, including in public
services such as health and education. Inequality has risen sharply, in
particular because of a tax system that does not tax wealth and inheritance.

### Data

## Contemporary economy

Real GDP growth in Sweden 1996–2006 Natural resources of Sweden. Fe – iron
ore, PY – pyrite, Cu – copper, Zn – zinc, As – arsenic, Ag – silver, Au –
gold, Pb – lead, U – uranium; in red: C – coal, OS – oil shale.

Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy featuring a modern distribution
system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labor
force. Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive
industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance.
Agriculture accounts for 2 percent of GDP and employment. The armaments
industry has a technologically highly advanced reputation.

The 20 largest Sweden-registered companies by turnover as of 2013[update] were
Volvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Hennes & Mauritz, Electrolux, Volvo
Personvagnar, Preem, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, ICA, Atlas Copco, Nordea, Svenska
Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, Scania, Securitas, Nordstjernan, SKF, ABB Norden
Holding, and Sony Mobile Communications AB. Sweden's industry is
overwhelmingly in public and state control, the most prominent example of this
is LKAB, a state-owned mining company, mostly active in the northern part of
the country, with the largest noted market share out of all its domestic
competitors.

Some 4.5 million residents are working, out of which around a third have a
tertiary education. GDP per hour worked is the world's 9th-highest at US$31 in
2006, compared to US$22 in Spain and US$35 in United States. According to the
OECD, deregulation, globalization, and technology-sector growth have been key
drivers of productivity. GDP per hour worked is growing 2+1⁄2 per cent a year
for the economy as a whole and trade-terms-balanced productivity growth 2%.
Sweden is a world leader in privatized pensions, and pension-funding problems
are small compared to many other Western European countries. The Swedish labor
market has become more flexible, but it still has some widely acknowledged
problems. The typical worker receives only 40% of their income after the tax
wedge. The slowly declining overall taxation, 51% of GDP in 2007, is still
nearly double of that in the United States or Ireland. Civil servants amount
to a third of Swedish workforce, multiple times the proportion in many other
countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s,
especially in manufacturing.

World Economic Forum 2012–2013 competitiveness index ranks Sweden 4th most
competitive. The Index of Economic Freedom 2012 ranks Sweden the 21st most
free out of 179 countries, or 10th out of 43 European countries. Sweden ranked
9th in the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook 2008, scoring high in private sector
efficiency. According to the book, _The Flight of the Creative Class_ , by the
U.S. urban studies, Professor Richard Florida of University of Toronto, Sweden
is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is
predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers.
The book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most
useful to business – talent, technology and tolerance. Sweden's investment
into research and development stood, in 2007, at over 3.5% of GDP. This is
considerably higher than that of a number of MEDCs, including the United
States, and is the largest among the OECD members.

Sweden rejected the Euro in a referendum in 2003, and Sweden maintains its own
currency, the Swedish krona (SEK). The Swedish Riksbank – founded in 1668 and
thus making it the oldest central bank in the world – is currently focusing on
price stability with its inflation target of 2%. According to _Economic Survey
of Sweden 2007_ by OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the
lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of
deregulation and quick utilization of globalization.

The largest trade flows are with Germany, United States, Norway, United
Kingdom, Denmark and Finland.

The Swedish economic picture has brightened significantly since the severe
recession in the early 1990s. Growth has been strong in recent years, and even
though the growth in the economy slackened between 2001 and 2003, the growth
rate has picked up since with an average growth rate of 3.7% in the last three
years. The long-run prospects for growth remain favorable. The inflation rate
is low and stable, with projections for continued low levels over the next 2–3
years.[_needs update_]

Since the mid-1990s the export sector has been booming, acting as the main
engine for economic growth. Swedish exports also have proven to be
surprisingly robust. A marked shift in the structure of the exports, where
services, the IT industry, and telecommunications have taken over from
traditional industries such as steel, paper and pulp, has made the Swedish
export sector less vulnerable to international fluctuations. However, at the
same time the Swedish industry has received less money for its exports while
the import prices have gone up. During the period 1995–2003 the export prices
were reduced by 4% at the same time as the import prices climbed by 11%. The
net effect is that the Swedish terms-of-trade fell 13%.

By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were warning of a bubble with
residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt
expanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF called on
legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater
supply of housing as demand was outstripping supply. By August 2014, 40% of
home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying
principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.

The government budget has improved dramatically from a record deficit of more
than 12% of GDP in 1993. In the last decade, from 1998 to present, the
government has run a surplus every year, except for 2003 and 2004. The surplus
for 2011 is expected to be 99 billion ($15b) kronor. The new, strict budget
process with spending ceilings set by the Riksdag, and a constitutional change
to an independent Central Bank, have greatly improved policy credibility.

From the perspective of longer-term fiscal sustainability, the long-awaited
reform of old-age pensions entered into force in 1999. This entails a far more
robust system vis-à-vis adverse demographic and economic trends, which should
keep the ratio of total pension disbursements to the aggregate wage bill close
to 20% in the decades ahead. Taken together, both fiscal consolidation and
pension reform have brought public finances back on a sustainable footing.
Gross public debt, which jumped from 43% of GDP in 1990 to 78% in 1994,
stabilised around the middle of the 1990s and started to come down again more
significantly beginning in 1999. In 2000 it fell below the key level of 60%
and had declined to a level of 35% of GDP as of 2010.

### Companies

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Sweden
was the services sector with 457,044 companies followed by finance, insurance,
and real estate with 184,377 companies.[_citation needed_] The construction
sector is well-developed in Sweden, with significant development in the level
of sub-contracting within the industry since the 1980s.

## Economic and monetary union

Current economic development reflects a quite remarkable improvement of the
Swedish economy since the crisis in 1991–93, so that Sweden could easily
qualify for membership in the third phase of the Economic and Monetary Union
of the European Union, adopting the euro as its currency. In theory, by the
rules of the EMU, Sweden is obliged to join, since the country has not
obtained exception by any protocol or treaty (as opposed to Denmark and the
United Kingdom). Nevertheless, the Swedish government decided in 1997 against
joining the common currency from its start on 1 January 1999. This choice was
implemented by exploiting a legal loophole, deliberately staying out of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This move is currently tolerated by the
European Central Bank, which however has warned that this would not be the
case for newer EU members.

In the first years of the twenty-first century, a majority for joining emerged
in the governing Social Democratic party, although the question was subject of
heated debate, with leading personalities in the party on both sides. On 14
September 2003, a national referendum was held on the euro. A 56% majority of
Swedes rejected the common currency, while 42% voted in favour of it.
Currently no plans for a new referendum or parliamentary vote on the matter
are being discussed, though it has been implied that another referendum may
take place in around ten years.

## Unemployment

In contrast with most other European countries, Sweden maintained an
unemployment rate around 2% or 3% of the work force throughout the 1980s. This
was, however, accompanied by high and accelerating inflation.[_citation
needed_] It became evident that such low unemployment rates were not
sustainable, and in the severe crisis of the early 1990s the rate increased to
more than 8%. In 1996 the government set out a goal of reducing unemployment
to 4% by 2000. During 2000 employment rose by 90,000 people, the greatest
increase in 40 years, and the goal was reached in the autumn of 2000. The same
autumn the government set out its new target: that 80% of the working age
population will have a regular job by 2004. Some have expressed concern that
meeting the employment target may come at a cost of too high a rate of wage
increases hence increasing inflation. However, as of August 2006, roughly 5%
of working age Swedes were unemployed, over the government-established goal.
However, some of the people who cannot find work are put away in so-called
"labour market political activities", referred to as "AMS-åtgärder".

According to Jan Edling, a former trade-unionist, the actual number of
unemployed is far higher, and those figures are being suppressed by both the
government and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. In Edling's report he
added that a further 3% of Swedes were occupied in state-organised job
schemes, not in the private sector. He also claimed a further 700,000 Swedes
are either on long-term sick leave or in early retirement. Edling asks how
many of these people are in fact unemployed. According to his report, the
"actual unemployment" rate hovers near 20%. Some critics disagree with this
concept of "actual" unemployment, also termed "broad unemployment", since they
do not see e.g. students who rather want a job, people on sick leave and
military conscripts as "unemployed".

According to Swedish Statistics, unemployment in June 2013 was 9.1% in the
general population and 29% amongst 15- to 25-year-olds.

## Trade unions

Around seventy percent of the Swedish labour force is unionised. For most
unions there is a counterpart employer's organization for businesses. The
unions and employer organisations are independent of both the government and
political parties, although the largest confederation of unions, the National
Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions or _LO_ (organising blue-collar
workers), maintains close links to one of the three major parties, the Social
Democrats.

The unionisation rate among white-collar workers is exceptionally high in
Sweden – since 2008 higher than for blue-collar workers. In 2023, blue-collar
density was 58%, and white-collar density was 73% (full-time students working
part-time excluded). Just before the considerably raised fees to union
unemployment funds in January 2007, blue-collar and white-collar union density
was the same (77% in 2006). The average union density was 70% in the years
2011–2014, 69% in 2015-2017 and 68% in 2018 and 2019. There are two major
confederations that organise professionals and other qualified employees: the
Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (_Tjänstemännens
Centralorganisation_ or TCO) and the Swedish Confederation of Professional
Associations (_Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation_ or SACO). They are
both independent from Sweden's political parties and never endorse candidates
for office in political elections.

There is no minimum wage that is required by legislation. Instead, minimum
wage standards in different sectors are normally set by collective bargaining.
About 90% of all workers are covered by collective agreements, in the private
sector 83% (2018). The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved
despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to
whole industries or sectors. This reflects the dominance of self-regulation
(regulation by the labour market parties themselves) over state regulation in
Swedish industrial relations.

Sweden has not joined the EMU (the Economic and Monetary Union / the Euro) and
will not in the foreseeable future. When the issue was at the agenda, the
Swedish union movement was very split. In contrast to the very positive
attitude of employers' associations, the union rank-and file opinion was so
split that several unions, as well as the confederations LO, TCO and SACO,
abstained from taking an official position.

## Labour force

The traditionally low wage differential has increased in recent years as a
result of increased flexibility as the role of wage setting at the company
level has strengthened somewhat. Still, Swedish unskilled employees are well
paid while well educated Swedish employees are low-paid compared with those in
competitor countries in Western Europe and the US. The average increases in
real wages in recent years have been high by historical standards, in large
part due to unforeseen price stability. Even so, nominal wages in recent years
have been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-
sector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in
Sweden, the comparable increase for the EU area was 1.75%. In the year 2000
the total labour force was around 4.4 million people.

## Ongoing and finished privatisations

The Swedish government has announced that it will privatise a number of wholly
and partly state owned companies. "The income from these sales will be used to
pay off the government debt and reduce the burden of debt for future
generations. The Government's ambition was to sell companies to a value of SEK
200 billion during 2007–2010."

Ongoing privatisations

    

  * Telia Sonera – telecom. 37.3% owned by the Swedish government. Hitherto SEK 18 billion worth of shares has been sold reducing state ownership from 45.3% to 37.3%.
  * SAS Group – airline. 14.8% owned by the Swedish government. On 13 October 2016 the Swedish government sold 13.8 million shares worth 213.9 million SEK. The Minister of Enterprise, Mikael Damberg stated that "There exists good reasons for the Swedish government not be a long-term owner of a publicly traded airline... This sell-off is a first step towards reducing the Swedish government's ownership in a responsible manner."

Completed privatisations

    

  * OMX – stock exchange. Shares sold to Borse Dubai for 2.1 billion SEK.
  * Vin & Sprit. Sold to Pernod Ricard for 5.6 billion Euro.
  * Vasakronan. Sold to AP Fastigheter for 4.3 billion Euro.
  * Nordea – bank. 19.5% owned by Swedish government. Last government-held block of shares was sold in September 2013.
