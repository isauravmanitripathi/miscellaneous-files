Change in per capita GDP of Madagascar, 1950–2018. Figures are inflation-
adjusted to 2011 International dollars.

The **economy ofMadagascar** is US$9.769 billion by gross domestic product as
of 2020, being a market economy and is supported by an agricultural industry
and emerging tourism, textile and mining industries. Malagasy agriculture
produces tropical staple crops such as rice and cassava, as well as cash crops
such as vanilla and coffee.

Malagasy exports from customs protocol in some areas, notably the United
States and the European Union. These exemptions have supported the growth of
the Malagasy textile industry. Despite natural resources and developing
industries, the 2009 Malagasy political crisis—considered by the international
community to be an illegal coup—deterred foreign investments in Madagascar and
caused the Malagasy economy to decline. Foreign investments have resumed
following the resumption of elections in early 2014.[_citation needed_]
Madagascar is a least developed country according to United Nations.

Madagascar's economy at 2024 is one of the fastest growing economies in the
world.

## History

Over the years, successive French colonial and independence-era governments
have sought to modernize Madagascar's economy. The first modern land use
projects were established by French settlers or Creole immigrants from the
Mascarene Islands in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. They introduced
cash crops such as coffee, sugarcane, vanilla, cloves, and sisal for export.
They also built small-scale mines to exploit the island's graphite, chromite,
and uranium resources. To facilitate the processing and marketing of these
commodities, the immigrants established a number of financial and commercial
enterprises and built a small, modern railroad system. They then brought some
Malagasy into this modern sector of the economy, either as wage laborers and
sharecroppers on the foreign-owned plantations, or as low-level employees in
the civil service or business enterprises. The foreign owners and managers,
however, retained almost all of the benefits from these operations.

After independence the Philibert Tsiranana regime did little to change the
French domination of the modern sector of the economy, despite increasing
outrage at this continued economic dependence. This anger, together with
growing concern over an unequal distribution of wealth that left the southern
and western parts of the island in relative poverty, caused the ouster of
Tsiranana in 1972 and a shift in economic policy. The new military regime led
by Gabriel Ramanantsoa cut most ties with France and began to Malagachize the
economy. Slow progress toward this goal, however, helped to precipitate the
end of the Ramanantsoa regime in mid-1975. Only with the rise of Didier
Ratsiraka to the presidency later that year did the takeover of formerly
French-dominated enterprises begin in earnest.

Ratsiraka's policy of "revolution from above" went beyond confiscating or
buying out foreign firms and turning them over to Malagasy ownership; he
intended to socialize the economy by nationalizing major enterprises. The
state acquired majority or minority ownership in nearly all large financial,
transportation, marketing, mining, and manufacturing enterprises. Firms left
under private control were required to buy and sell at state-controlled
prices, and the state closely monitored the repatriation of profits. In the
rural sector, Ratsiraka aimed to establish local farming cooperatives. Almost
as important as this institutional reform was the regime's intention,
announced in an economic plan for the 1978-80 period, to increase dramatically
the level of government capital investment in all sectors of the economy in
order to improve the availability of goods and services to all.

By the start of the 1980s, however, Ratsiraka's attempt to fashion viable
socialist institutions and to stimulate the economy through increased
investment had failed to improve economic production and welfare. Economic
growth throughout the 1970s had not kept pace with the expanding population.
Despite the availability of significant agricultural and mineral resources,
the economy was less productive than at the start of the decade when the
average per capita income was already among the lowest in the world. The only
apparent effect of the enhanced level of investment, which reached all-time
highs in the 1978-80 period, was to put the country deeply in debt to foreign
creditors and, therefore, pave the way for a series of structural adjustment
agreements signed with the IMF and the World Bank during the 1980s and the
early 1990s. Such agreements were necessary because as a 1993 World Bank study
pointed out, between 1971 and 1991 the per capita income of Malagasy dropped
40 percent.

Eventually admitting that adoption of the socialist model of economic
centralization and state control was a mistake, the Ratsiraka regime in 1980
initiated a return to a more classic liberal economic model that the Albert
Zafy regime wholeheartedly adopted following its inauguration in 1993. The
post-1980 Ratsiraka and Zafy regimes have overseen the privatization of
parastatals, the disbanding of agricultural marketing boards, the ratification
of more liberal investment codes favoring foreign investment, the
privatization of the banking industry, diversification of traditional,
primary-product exports, and greater investment in food production. The Zafy
regime has made reinvigoration of the Malagasy economy its number-one
priority.

As of 1994, the majority of Malagasy continued to earn their livelihoods in
ways fundamentally unchanged from those of their ancestors — small-scale farms
supporting traditional irrigated rice cultivation, dryland farming of cassava
and other foods, zebu cattle herding, or the raising of cash crops.

On April 2, 2025, Donald J. Trump declared "reciprocal tariffs" of 47% on
Madagascar. Madagascar, produces around 80% of the world's vanilla, and such
export was put at risk by Trump's new policy towards Madagascar exporters.

## Agriculture

Madagascar produced, in 2018:

  * 4 million tons of rice;
  * 3.1 million tons of sugarcane;
  * 2.5 million tons of cassava;
  * 1 million tons of sweet potato;
  * 388 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 383 thousand tons of banana;
  * 300 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
  * 257 thousand tons of potato;
  * 230 thousand tons of taro;
  * 215 thousand tons of maize;
  * 93 thousand tons of pineapple;
  * 86 thousand tons of beans;
  * 83 thousand tons of orange;
  * 73 thousand tons of coconut;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like coffee
(57 thousand tons), clove (23 thousand tons), cocoa (11 thousand tons), cashew
(7 thousand tons) and vanilla (3 thousand tons).

Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is Madagascar's largest industry
and employs 82% of its labor force. Madagascar's varied climate, ranging from
tropical along the coasts, moderate in the highlands and arid in the south,
allows for the cultivation of tropical crops such as rice, cassava, beans and
bananas. In 2011, agricultural products—especially cloves, vanilla, cacao,
sugar, pepper, and coffee—accounted for Madagascar's top twelve exports by
value. Madagascar produces the largest vanilla harvest in the world and
Malagasy vanilla accounts for 80-85% of the global vanilla market.
Madagascar's vanilla market in the US was put at risk in April 2025 following
Donald J. Trump's declaration of "reciprocal tariffs" amounting to 47%.

### Fishing

The fishing industry is present with 66 industrial fishing vessels. Fees &
taxes for fishing licences are estimated at 3,6 billion Ariary (US$80 million)
for 2023.

## Textiles

Exports from Madagascar's Export Processing Zones, located around Antananarivo
and Antsirabe, account for the majority of garment exports and are largely
exempt from customs restrictions in the United States under the African Growth
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and in the European Union under the Everything but
Arms (EBA) agreement.

## Mining

A small but growing part of the economy is based on mining of ilmenite, with
investments emerging in recent years, particularly near Tulear and Fort
Dauphin. Mining corporation Rio Tinto started production at its Fort Dauphin
Mandena mine in January 2009, following several years of preparation. The
mining project is highly controversial, with Friends of the Earth and other
environmental organizations filing reports to detail their concerns about the
mine's effect on the environment and local communities. Gemstone mining is
also an important part of Madagascar's economy.

Several major projects are underway in the mining and oil and gas sectors
that, if successful, will give a significant boost. In the mining sector,
these include the development of coal at Sakoa and nickel near Tamatave. The
Ambatovy mine (nickel & cobalt - Sherrit International 40%, Sumitomo 27.5%,
Korea Resources 27.5%, SNC-Lavalin 5%) is a huge operation and has cost
US$4.76 million to date and is due to start production in 2011. In oil,
Madagascar Oil is developing the massive onshore heavy oil field at Tsimiroro
and ultra heavy oil field at Bemolanga.

Former President Marc Ravalomanana of Madagascar

Following the 2002 political crisis, the government attempted to set a new
course and build confidence, in coordination with international financial
institutions and donors. Madagascar developed a recovery plan in collaboration
with the private sector and donors and presented it at a "Friends of
Madagascar" conference organized by the World Bank in Paris in July
2002.[_citation needed_] Donor countries demonstrated their confidence in the
new government by pledging $1 billion in assistance over five years. The
Malagasy Government identified road infrastructure as its principal priority
and underlined its commitment to public-private partnership by establishing a
joint public-private sector steering committee.[_citation needed_]

The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed as a collaboration between the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Malagasian
artisan producers in Madagascar in 2002. The U.S.-Madagascar Business Council
was formed in the United States in May 2003, and the two organisations
continue to explore ways to work for the benefit of both groups.[_citation
needed_]

The government of former President Marc Ravalomanana was aggressively seeking
foreign investment and had planned to tackle many of the obstacles to such
investment, including combating corruption, reforming land-ownership laws,
encouraging study of American and European business techniques, and active
pursuit of foreign investors. [_citation needed_]President Ravalomanana rose
to prominence through his agro-foods TIKO company, and is known for attempting
to apply many of the lessons learned in the world of business to running the
government.[_citation needed_] Prior to Ravalomanana's resignation, concerns
had arisen about the conflict of interest between his policies and the
activities of his firms. Most notable among them the preferential treatment
for rice imports initiated by the government in late 2004 when responding to a
production shortfall in the country.[_citation needed_]

Madagascar's appeal to investors stems from its competitive, trainable work
force. More than 200 investors, particularly garment manufacturers, were
organized under the country's export processing zone (EPZ) system since it was
established in 1989.[_citation needed_] The absence of quota limits on textile
imports to the European market under the Lomé Convention helped stimulate this
growth.[_citation needed_]

Port Toamasina

Growth in output in 1992–97 averaged less than the growth rate of the
population. Growth has been taken away by a decline in world coffee demand,
and the erratic commitment of the government to economic reform. During a
period of solid growth from 1997 to 2001, poverty levels remained stubbornly
high, especially in rural areas. A six-month political crisis triggered by a
dispute over the outcome of the presidential elections held in December 2001
virtually halted economic activity in much of the country in the first half of
2002. Real GDP dropped 12.7% in 2002, inflows of foreign investment dropped
sharply, and the crisis tarnished Madagascar's budding reputation as an AGOA
standout and a promising place to invest. After the crisis, the economy
rebounded with GDP growth of over 10% in 2003.[_citation needed_] Currency
depreciation and rising inflation in 2004 hampered economic performance, but
growth for the year reached 5.3%, with inflation reaching around 25% at the
end of the year.[_citation needed_] In 2005, inflation was brought under
control by tight monetary policy of raising the _Taux Directeur_ (central bank
rate) to 16% and tightening reserve requirements for banks. Thus growth was
expected to reach around 6.5% in 2005.[_citation needed_]

During Ravalomanana's presidency, the government adopted a series of business
laws and regulations, including the commercial companies law (2003), labor law
(2003), regulations on the application of commercial companies law (2004),
public procurement law (2004), competition law (2005), foreign exchange law
(2006), investment law (2007), and free zones and free enterprises law (2007).

## Food security, vulnerability and risk management

Vibrant Antananarivo is the political and economic capital of Madagascar

Despite a wealth of abundant and diverse natural resources, Madagascar is one
of the world's poorest countries. Madagascar holds great potential for
agricultural development, mainly due to the large variety of soil types and
climatic diversity. Nevertheless, natural hazards (cyclones, drought, locust
invasions) combined with old-fashioned farming practices limit production.

The standard of living of the Malagasy population has been declining
dramatically over the past 25 years. The country has gone from being a net
exporter of agricultural products in the 1960s to a net importer since 1971.
Inappropriate traditional agricultural methods cause soil to erode and soil
quality to decline, and the basis of survival for Madagascar's people is under
serious threat.

Madagascar has high photovoltaic power potential.

As of 2018, only 15% of the population of Madagascar has access to
electricity. By 2023, this has increased to 34%. Madagascar has a technically
feasible hydropower potential of about 180,000 GWh. Less than 1% has been
developed so far, with 162 MW of installed hydro capacity producing 61% of the
country's electricity. The country has enormous potential for exploiting solar
power, but general infrastructure is still lacking.[_citation needed_]

Local market vendors.

In 2000, Madagascar embarked on the preparation of a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) under the Heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC)
Initiative. The boards of the IMF and of the World Bank concurred in December
2000 that the country was eligible under the HIPC Initiative, and Madagascar
reached the decision point for debt relief. On March 1, 2001, the IMF Board
granted the country $103 million for 2001–03 under the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGR). Resources were intended for improving access to
health, education, rural roads, water, and direct support to communities. In
addition, on March 7, 2001, the Paris Club approved a debt cancellation of
$161 million. On February 28, 2001, the African Development Bank (ADB)
approved under the HIPC a debt cancellation of $71.46 million and granted in
June 2001 an additional credit of $20 million to fight against AIDS and
poverty.

Partly as a result of these credits but also as a result of previous reforms,
average GDP growth exceeded the population growth rate of 2.8% in 1997 (3.5%),
1998 (3.9%), 1999 (4.7%) and 2000 (4.8%).

In October 2004, the boards of the IMF and the World Bank determined that
Madagascar had reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.

## Child labour

Child labour in Brickaville, a city in Atsinanana region of Madagascar

Children are common in small scale mines of Madagascar. Some are involved in
salt mining, quarry work, gem and gold ore collection. About 58% of children
in these mines are younger than age 12. According to IPEC, Child labourers in
these mines usually come from families who are in precarious economic
situation.

According to a United States-based 2010 report, about 22% of Madagascar
children aged 5–14, or over 1.2 million work. Another French based group
suggests Madagascar child labour exceeds 2.4 million, with over 540,000
children aged 5–9 working. About 87% of the child labour is in agriculture,
mainly in the production of vanilla, tea, cotton, cocoa, copra (dried meat of
coconut), sisal, shrimp harvest and fishing. Malagasy children engaged in
domestic service work an average of 12 hours per day.

Several internationally funded efforts were involved in Madagascar to help
reduce and prevent child labour. However these stopped, after the government
change following 2009 coup, because much of the funding from international
donors, including the African Union, European Union, World Bank and the United
States, was suspended.
