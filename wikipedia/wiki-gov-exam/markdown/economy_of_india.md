The **economy of India** is a developing mixed economy with a notable public
sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fourth-largest economy by
nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per
capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP
(PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed
the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive
Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources,
bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised
as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an
acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad
economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about
1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control
and ownership of railways and highways. The Indian government has major
control over banking, insurance, farming, fertilizers and chemicals, airports,
essential utilities. The state also exerts substantial control over
digitalization, telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping
industries, which were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s but has seen
the emergence of key corporate players.

Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country
remains the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Aside private consumption,
India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports.
In 2022, India was the world's 10th-largest importer and the 8th-largest
exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1
January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the ease of doing business index and 40th on
the Global Competitiveness Index. India has one of the world's highest number
of billionaires along with extreme income inequality. Economists and social
scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social
welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22, which is much lower than the
average for OECD nations. With 586 million workers, the Indian labour force is
the world's second-largest. Despite having one of the longest working hours,
India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world.
Economists say that due to structural economic problems, India is experiencing
jobless economic growth.

During the Great Recession, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India endorsed
Keynesian policy and initiated stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to
boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth
revived.

In 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82 billion. The
leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D.
India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including
ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Arab
Emirates, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage.

The service sector makes up more than 50% of GDP and remains the fastest
growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector
employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National
Stock Exchange are some of the world's largest stock exchanges by market
capitalisation. India is the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, representing
2.6% of global manufacturing output. Nearly 65% of India's population is
rural, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. India faces high
unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand.
India's gross domestic savings rate stood at 29.3% of GDP in 2022.

## History

For a continuous duration of nearly 1700 years from the year 1 CE, India was
the world's largest economy, constituting 35 to 40% of the world GDP. The
combination of protectionist, import-substitution, Fabian socialism, and
social democratic-inspired policies governed India for sometime after the end
of British rule. The economy was then characterised as Dirigism, It had
extensive regulation, protectionism, public ownership of large monopolies,
pervasive corruption and slow growth. Since 1991, continuing economic
liberalisation has moved the country towards a market-based economy. By 2008,
India had established itself as one of the world's faster-growing economies.

### Ancient and medieval eras

#### Indus Valley Civilisation

The citizens of the Indus Valley civilisation, a permanent settlement that
flourished between 2800 BCE and 1800 BCE, practised agriculture, domesticated
animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded
with other cities. Evidence of well-planned streets, a drainage system, and
water supply reveals their knowledge of urban planning, which included the
first-known urban sanitation systems and the existence of a form of municipal
government.

#### West Coast

Maritime trade was carried out extensively between southern regions of India
and Southeast Asia and West Asia from early times until around the fourteenth
century CE. Both the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts were the sites of important
trading centres from as early as the first century BCE, used for import and
export as well as transit points between the Mediterranean region and
southeast Asia. Over time, traders organised themselves into associations
which received state patronage. This state patronage for overseas trade came
to an end by the thirteenth century CE, when it was largely taken over by the
local Parsi, Jewish, Syrian Christian, and Muslim communities, initially on
the Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.

#### Silk Route

Other scholars suggest trading from India to West Asia and Eastern Europe was
active between the 14th and 18th centuries. During this period, Indian traders
settled in Surakhani, a suburb of greater Baku, Azerbaijan. These traders
built a Hindu temple, which suggests commerce was active and prosperous for
Indians by the 17th century.

Further north, the Saurashtra and Bengal coasts played an important role in
maritime trade, and the Gangetic plains and the Indus valley housed several
centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was carried out via the
Khyber Pass connecting the Punjab region with Afghanistan and onward to the
Middle East and Central Asia. Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins,
barter was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as
revenue to the rulers, while their craftsmen received a part of the crops at
harvest time for their services.

### Mughal, Rajput, and Maratha eras (1526–1820)

The Indian economy was the largest and most prosperous throughout world
history and would continue to be under the Mughal Empire, up until the 18th
century. Sean Harkin estimates that China and India may have accounted for 60
to 70 percent of world GDP in the 17th century. The Mughal economy functioned
on an elaborate system of coined currency, land revenue and trade. Gold,
silver and copper coins were issued by the royal mints which functioned on the
basis of free coinage. The political stability and uniform revenue policy
resulting from a centralized administration under the Mughals, coupled with a
well-developed internal trade network, ensured that India–before the arrival
of the British–was to a large extent economically unified, despite having a
traditional agrarian economy characterised by a predominance of subsistence
agriculture. Agricultural production increased under Mughal agrarian reforms,
with Indian agriculture being advanced compared to Europe at the time, such as
the widespread use of the seed drill among Indian peasants before its adoption
in European agriculture, and possibly higher per-capita agricultural output
and standards of consumption than 17th century Europe.

The Mughal Empire had a thriving industrial manufacturing economy, with India
producing about 25% of the world's industrial output up until 1750, making it
the most important manufacturing centre in international trade. Manufactured
goods and cash crops from the Mughal Empire were sold throughout the world.
Key industries included textiles, shipbuilding, and steel, and processed
exports included cotton textiles, yarns, thread, silk, jute products,
metalware, and foods such as sugar, oils and butter. Cities and towns boomed
under the Mughal Empire, which had a relatively high degree of urbanization
for its time, with 15% of its population living in urban centres, higher than
the percentage of the urban population in contemporary Europe at the time and
higher than that of British India in the 19th century.

In early modern Europe, there was significant demand for products from Mughal
India, particularly cotton textiles, as well as goods such as spices, peppers,
indigo, silks, and saltpeter (for use in munitions). European fashion, for
example, became increasingly dependent on Mughal Indian textiles and silks.
From the late 17th century to the early 18th century, Mughal India accounted
for 95% of British imports from Asia, and the Bengal Subah province alone
accounted for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia. In contrast, there was very
little demand for European goods in Mughal India, which was largely self-
sufficient. Indian goods, especially those from Bengal, were also exported in
large quantities to other Asian markets, such as Indonesia and Japan. At the
time, Mughal Bengal was the most important centre of cotton textile
production.

In the early 18th century the Mughal Empire declined, as it lost western,
central and parts of south and north India to the Maratha Empire, which
integrated and continued to administer those regions. The decline of the
Mughal Empire led to decreased agricultural productivity, which in turn
negatively affected the textile industry. The subcontinent's dominant economic
power in the post-Mughal era was the Bengal Subah in the east., which
continued to maintain thriving textile industries and relatively high real
wages. However, the former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal
and then British colonization in the mid-18th century. After the loss at the
Third Battle of Panipat, the Maratha Empire disintegrated into several
confederate states, and the resulting political instability and armed conflict
severely affected economic life in several parts of the country – although
this was mitigated by localised prosperity in the new provincial kingdoms. By
the late eighteenth century, the British East India Company had entered the
Indian political theatre and established its dominance over other European
powers. This marked a determinative shift in India's trade, and a less-
powerful effect on the rest of the economy.

### British era (1793–1947)

The global contribution to world's GDP by major economies from 1 CE to 2003 CE
according to Angus Maddison's estimates. Up until the 18th century, China and
India were the two largest economies by GDP output.

From the beginning of the 19th century, the British East India Company's
gradual expansion and consolidation of power brought a major change in
taxation and agricultural policies, which tended to promote commercialisation
of agriculture with a focus on trade, resulting in decreased production of
food crops, mass impoverishment and destitution of farmers, and in the short
term, led to numerous famines. The economic policies of the British Raj caused
a severe decline in the handicrafts and handloom sectors, due to reduced
demand and dipping employment. After the removal of international restrictions
by the Charter of 1813, Indian trade expanded substantially with steady
growth. The result was a significant transfer of capital from India to
Britain, which, due to the colonial policies of the British, led to a massive
drain of revenue rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the
domestic economy. The economy of the Indian subcontinent was the largest in
the world for most of recorded history up until the onset of colonialism in
early 19th century.

Estimated GDP per capita of India and United Kingdom during 1700–1950 in 1990
US$according to Maddison. However, Maddison's estimates for 18th-century India
have been criticized as gross underestimates, Bairoch estimates India had a
higher GDP per capita in the 18th century, and Parthasarathi's findings show
higher real wages in 18th-century Bengal and Mysore. But there is consensus
that India's per capita GDP and income stagnated during the colonial era,
starting in the late 18th century.

Under British rule, India's share of the world economy declined from 24.4% in
1700 down to 4.2% in 1950. India's GDP (PPP) per capita was stagnant during
the Mughal Empire and began to decline prior to the onset of British rule.
India's share of global industrial output declined from 25% in 1750 down to 2%
in 1900. At the same time, Britain's share of the world economy rose from 2.9%
in 1700 up to 9% in 1870. The British East India Company, following their
conquest of Bengal in 1757, had forced open the large Indian market to British
goods, which could be sold in India without tariffs or duties, compared to
local Indian producers who were heavily taxed, while in Britain protectionist
policies such as bans and high tariffs were implemented to restrict Indian
textiles from being sold there, whereas raw cotton was imported from India
without tariffs to British factories which manufactured textiles from Indian
cotton and sold them back to the Indian market. British economic policies gave
them a monopoly over India's large market and cotton resources. India served
as both a significant supplier of raw goods to British manufacturers and a
large captive market for British manufactured goods.

British territorial expansion in India throughout the 19th century created an
institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed property rights among the
colonisers, encouraged free trade, and created a single currency with fixed
exchange rates, standardised weights and measures and capital markets within
the company-held territories. It also established a system of railways and
telegraphs, a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference,
a common-law, and an adversarial legal system. This coincided with major
changes in the world economy – industrialisation, and significant growth in
production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an
economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, with industrial
development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population,
a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely inadequate
infrastructure.

The 1872 census revealed that 91.3% of the population of the region
constituting present-day India resided in villages. This was a decline from
the earlier Mughal era, when 85% of the population resided in villages and 15%
in urban centres under Akbar's reign in 1600. Urbanisation generally remained
sluggish in British India until the 1920s, due to the lack of
industrialisation and absence of adequate transportation. Subsequently, the
policy of discriminating protection (where certain important industries were
given financial protection by the state), coupled with the Second World War,
saw the development and dispersal of industries, encouraging rural-urban
migration, and in particular, the large port cities of Bombay, Calcutta and
Madras grew rapidly. Despite this, only one-sixth of India's population lived
in cities by 1951.

The effect of British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic.
Leaders of the Indian independence movement and economic historians have
blamed colonial rule for India's poor economic performance following
independence and argued that the capital required for the Industrial
Revolution in Britain came from India. At the same time, other historians have
countered that India's poor economic performance was due to various sectors
being in a state of growth and decline due to changes brought in by
colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialisation and economic
integration.

Several economic historians have argued that Indian real wages declined in the
early 19th century, or possibly beginning in the very late 18th century,
largely as a result of British colonial rule. According to Prasannan
Parthasarathi and Sashi Sivramkrishna, the grain wages of Indian weavers were
likely comparable to that of their British counterparts and their average
income was around five times the subsistence level, which was comparable to
advanced parts of Europe. However they concluded that due to the scarcity of
data, it was hard to draw definitive conclusions and that more research was
required. It has also been argued that India went through a period of
deindustrialization in the latter half of the 18th century as an indirect
outcome of the collapse of the Mughal Empire.

### Pre-liberalisation period (1947–1991)

Navi Mumbai built during pre-liberalization

Indian economic policy after independence was influenced by the colonial
experience, which was seen as exploitative by Indian leaders exposed to the
planned economy of the Soviet Union. Domestic policy tended towards
protectionism, with a strong emphasis on import substitution
industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public
sector, business regulation, and central planning, while trade and foreign
investment policies were relatively liberal. Five-Year Plans of India
resembled central planning in the Soviet Union. Steel, mining, machine tools,
telecommunications, insurance, and power plants, among other industries, were
effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s. The Indian economy of this period
is characterised as Dirigism.

Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, along with the
statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, formulated and oversaw economic
policy during the initial years of the country's independence. They expected
favourable outcomes from their strategy, involving the rapid development of
heavy industry by both public and private sectors, and based on direct and
indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme Soviet-style central
command system. The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and
technology-intensive heavy industry and subsidising manual, low-skill cottage
industries was criticised by economist Milton Friedman, who thought it would
waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturers.

Since 1965, the use of high-yielding varieties of seeds, increased fertilisers
and improved irrigation facilities collectively contributed to the Green
Revolution in India, which improved the condition of agriculture by increasing
crop productivity, improving crop patterns and strengthening forward and
backward linkages between agriculture and industry. However, it has also been
criticised as an unsustainable effort, resulting in the growth of capitalistic
farming, ignoring institutional reforms and widening income disparities.

In 1984, Rajiv Gandhi promised economic liberalization, he made V. P. Singh
the finance minister, who tried to reduce tax evasion and tax receipts rose
due to this crackdown although taxes were lowered. This process lost its
momentum during the later tenure of Mr. Gandhi as his government was marred by
scandals.

### Post-liberalisation period (since 1991)

The collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India's major trading partner, and
the Gulf War, which caused a spike in oil prices, resulted in a major balance-
of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of
defaulting on its loans. India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), which in return demanded de-regulation.

In response, the Narasimha Rao government, including Finance Minister Manmohan
Singh, initiated economic reforms in 1991. The reforms did away with the
Licence Raj, reduced tariffs and interest rates and ended many public
monopolies, allowing automatic approval of foreign direct investment in many
sectors. Since then, the overall thrust of liberalisation has remained the
same, although no government has tried to take on powerful lobbies such as
trade unions and farmers, on contentious issues such as reforming labour laws
and reducing agricultural subsidies. This has been accompanied by increases in
life expectancy, literacy rates, and food security, although urban residents
have benefited more than rural residents.

GDP grows exponentially, almost doubling every five years. Indian GDP growth
rate from 1985 to 2016 in red, compared to that of China in green

From 2010, India has risen from ninth-largest to the fifth-largest economies
in the world by nominal GDP in 2019 by surpassing UK, France, Italy and
Brazil.

India started recovery in 2013–14 when the GDP growth rate accelerated to 6.4%
from the previous year's 5.5%. The acceleration continued through 2014–15 and
2015–16 with growth rates of 7.5% and 8.0% respectively. For the first time
since 1990, India grew faster than China which registered 6.9% growth in
2015.[_needs update_] However the growth rate subsequently decelerated, to
7.1% and 6.6% in 2016–17 and 2017–18 respectively, partly because of the
disruptive effects of 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation and the Goods and
Services Tax (India).

India is ranked 63rd out of 190 countries in the World Bank's 2020 ease of
doing business index, up 14 points from the last year's 100 and up 37 points
in just two years. In terms of dealing with construction permits and enforcing
contracts, it is ranked among the 10 worst in the world, while it has a
relatively favourable ranking when it comes to protecting minority investors
or getting credit. The strong efforts taken by the Department of Industrial
Policy and Promotion (DIPP) to boost ease of doing business rankings at the
state level is said to affect the overall rankings of India.

### COVID-19 pandemic and aftermath (2020–present)

During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous rating agencies downgraded India's GDP
predictions for FY21 to negative figures, signalling a recession in India, the
most severe since 1979. The Indian Economy contracted by 6.6 percent which was
lower than the estimated 7.3 percent decline. In 2022, the ratings agency
Fitch Ratings upgraded India's outlook to stable similar to S&P Global Ratings
and Moody's Investors Service's outlooks. In the first quarter of financial
year 2022–2023, the Indian economy grew by 13.5%.

## Regional economies

India's regional economies vary significantly in terms of output, industrial
composition, and development levels. Maharashtra has the largest state
economy, contributing over 13% to the national GDP, followed by Tamil Nadu,
Karnataka, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. These five states collectively account
for nearly half of India's economic output. Southern states such as Tamil
Nadu, Karnataka, and Telangana are known for strong performance in services
and manufacturing, while western states like Gujarat and Maharashtra are
industrial powerhouses. In contrast, eastern and central states such as Bihar,
Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh exhibit lower GDPs, reflecting ongoing challenges
in industrialisation and infrastructure. Union Territories like Delhi and
Chandigarh, though smaller in size, have high per capita incomes due to urban-
centric service-driven economies. This economic landscape highlights both
growth opportunities and regional disparities, underscoring the need for
tailored economic strategies across states.

### Agriculture, forest, and fishing

Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounted
for 18.4% of the GDP, the sector employed 51.2 crore persons or 45.5% of the
workforce in India are employed in agriculture. India is major agriculture
producing country and has the most arable land in the world followed by the
United States. However, agricultural output lags far behind its potential.
Agriculture's contribution to GDP has steadily declined from 1951 to 2023,
shifting from 52% to 15% of India's GDP yet it is still the country's largest
employment provider sector . Crop-yield-per-unit-area of all crops has grown
since 1950, due to the special emphasis placed on agriculture in the five-year
plans and steady improvements in irrigation, technology, application of modern
agricultural practices and provision of agricultural credit and subsidies
since the Green Revolution in India. However, international comparisons reveal
the average yield in India is generally 30% to 50% of the highest average
yield in the world. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, West Bengal, Gujarat and
Maharashtra are key contributors to Indian agriculture.

India receives an average annual rainfall of 1,208 millimetres (47.6 in) and a
total annual precipitation of 4,000 billion cubic metres, with the total
utilisable water resources, including surface and groundwater, amounting to
1,123 billion cubic metres. 546,820 square kilometres (211,130 sq mi) of the
land area, or about 39% of the total cultivated area, is irrigated. India's
inland water resources and marine resources provide employment to nearly 6
million people in the fisheries sector. In 2023, according to the Ministry of
Fisheries, India is the 3rd largest fish producing and 2nd largest aquaculture
producing nation in the world.

India exports more than 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons)
of processed cashew kernels every year. There are more than 600 cashew
processing units in Kollam alone.

India is the largest producer of milk, jute and pulses, and has the world's
largest cattle population with 303 million animals in 2023. It is the second-
largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton and groundnuts, as well as
the second-largest fruit and vegetable producer, accounting for 10.9% and 8.6%
of the world fruit and vegetable production, respectively, but only for 1% of
global fruits and vegetables trade. India is also the second-largest producer
and the largest consumer of silk, producing 77,000 tonnes (76,000 long tons;
85,000 short tons) in 2005. India is the second-largest exporter of cashew
kernels and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). Foreign exchange earned by the
country through the export of cashew kernels during FY 2023 reached 356M$.
76,624 tonnes (75,414 long tons; 84,464 short tons) of kernels were exported
during 2023. There are about 600 cashew processing units in Kollam, Kerala.

India's foodgrain production stagnant at approximately 316 megatonnes (311
million long tons; 348 million short tons) during 2020–21. India exports
several agriculture products, such as Basmati rice, wheat, cereals, spices,
fresh fruits, dry fruits, cotton, tea, coffee, milk products and other cash
crops to the Asian, African and other countries.

The low productivity in India is a result of several factors.Over-regulation
of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty, and
governmental intervention in labour, land, and credit are hurting the market.
Infrastructure such as rural roads, electricity, ports, food storage, retail
markets and services remain inadequate. The average size of land holdings is
very small, with 70% of holdings being less than one hectare (2.5 acres) in
size. Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only
46% of the total cultivable land was irrigated as of 2016,[update] resulting
in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the monsoon season,
which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country. In an
effort to bring an additional 20,000,000 hectares (49,000,000 acres) of land
under irrigation, various schemes have been attempted, including the
Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) which was provided ₹800
billion (equivalent to ₹1.2 trillion or US$14 billion in 2023) in the Union
Budget. Farming incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and
distribution infrastructure; a third of India's agricultural production is
lost from spoilage.

### Automobile industry

The automotive industry in India is one of the largest and fastest-growing
globally, contributing significantly to the country’s economy, employment, and
export performance. As of 2023, India ranked as the fourth-largest automobile
producer in the world, following China, United States and Japan. The sector
accounts for approximately 7.1% of India's GDP and employs over 37 million
people directly and indirectly. As of April 2022[update], India's auto
industry is worth more than US$100 billion and accounts for 8% of the
country's total exports and 7.1% of India's GDP.

India's automotive market comprises both domestic and international
manufacturers. Key passenger vehicle producers include Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai
Motor India, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Kia India, and Toyota Kirloskar
Motor. In the two-wheeler segment, leading companies are Hero MotoCorp, Honda
Motorcycle and Scooter India, TVS Motor, and Bajaj Auto. The commercial
vehicle space is dominated by Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and Mahindra &
Mahindra.

### Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME)

India began its first few steps during the years 1978-80 when early conditions
for SMEs or entrepreneurship were hostile too. 63 million MSMEs in India which
contribute _35% to the country's GDP_ provides employment to 111.4 million
persons and accounts for more than 40% of India's exports and are hailed as
the ‘growth engines’ of the economy.China has been creating 16,000-18,000 new
enterprises per day for the last 5 years. When you compare that with India, it
is about 1000-1100 per day.

Micro and small enterprises have the potential to resolve India's unemployment
crisis provided the constraints impeding the growth of the sector are
resolved.According to Annual MSME Report 2021-22, over 90 per cent of India's
6.3 crore MSMEs are in the micro-segment. Within the micro sector, 62 per cent
firms are self-employments which no workers, another 32 per cent have two or
three workers and just 6-7 per cent have four workers or above (up to 19). In
2023, SME IPOs set a record-breaking year with 179 listings.

In Budget 2023, The government has implemented a number of reforms aimed at
boosting MSMEs' growth in India while also improving their international
competitiveness.

### Machinery, Tools and equipment

Machinery and equipment market is expected to grow 8% from 2024 to 2029.
India's Industrial Machinery Equipment and Tools market size is expected to be
$210 billion in 2023.The rise in R&D and large number of startups has led to
increase in investment in tools, industrial equipment, robotics, industrial
automation, pharmaceutical machinery, mining & construction equipment.

Indian Government has launched an initiative in promoting electrification of
fossil-fuel based equipment hence reducing carbon footprint and leading to new
innovations.

### Mining, resources, and chemicals

#### Mining

an NLC India mine

India has, in 2022, a reported 1,319 mines of which reporting mines for
metallic minerals were estimated at 545 and non-metallic minerals at 775.

Mining contributed to 1.75% of GDP and employed directly or undirecly 11
million people in 2021. India's mining industry was the fourth-largest
producer of minerals in the world by volume, and eighth-largest producer by
value in 2009. In 2013, it mined and processed 89 minerals, of which four were
fuel, three were atomic energy minerals, and 80 non-fuel. The public sector
accounted for 68% of mineral production by volume in 2011–12. India has the
world's fourth-largest natural resources, with the mining sector contributing
11% of the country's industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP.

Nearly 50% of India's mining industry, by output value, is concentrated in
eight states: Odisha, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana,
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Another 25% of the output by value
comes from offshore oil and gas resources. India operated about 3,000 mines in
2010, half of which were coal, limestone and iron ore. On output-value basis,
India was one of the five largest producers of mica, chromite, coal, lignite,
iron ore, bauxite, barite, zinc and manganese; while being one of the ten
largest global producers of many other minerals. India was the fourth-largest
producer of steel in 2013, and the seventh-largest producer of aluminium.

India's mineral resources are vast. However, its mining industry has declined
– contributing 2.3% of its GDP in 2010 compared to 3% in 2000, and employed
2.9 million people – a decreasing percentage of its total labour. India is a
net importer of many minerals including coal. India's mining sector decline is
because of complex permit, regulatory and administrative procedures,
inadequate infrastructure, shortage of capital resources, and slow adoption of
environmentally sustainable technologies.

#### Cement

Indian cement industry is the 2nd largest cement producing country in the
world, next only to China. At present, the Installed Capacity of Cement in
India is 500 MTPA with production of 298 million tonnes per annum. Majority of
the cement plants installed capacity (about 35%) is located in the states of
south India. In PAT scheme, Total Installed Capacity of Cement in India is 325
MTPA which contributes to 65% coverage of total installed capacity in India.

#### Iron and steel

Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) alone contributes 45% of SAIL's profit and it
produces highly diversified steel portfolio

India surpassed Japan as the second largest steel producer in January 2019. As
per worldsteel, India's crude steel production in 2018 was at 106.5 tonnes
(104.8 long tons; 117.4 short tons), 4.9% increase from 101.5 tonnes (99.9
long tons; 111.9 short tons) in 2017, which means that India overtook Japan as
the world's second largest steel production country.

According to data presented by PIB(FY2021-22), there are more than 900 steel
plants in India that produce crude steel. These are owned by PSUs, large-scale
companies as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the year 2021–22,
the total capacity of these plants stood at 154.06 million tonnes.

The total market value of the Indian steel sector stood at US$57.8 billion in
2011 and is predicted to touch US$95.3 billion by 2016.Growth of crude steel
production in India has not kept pace with the growth in capacity of
production, according to the report. As per this report, steel sector
contributes 2 per cent to India's GDP and employs half a million people
directly and 2 million people indirectly. The Indian steel sector has been
vibrant, growing at a compounded rate of 6% year-on-year.

#### Petroleum

MRPL Refinery in Mangalore

Petroleum products and chemicals are a major contributor to India's industrial
GDP, and together they contribute over 34% of its export earnings. India hosts
many oil refinery and petrochemical operations developed with help of Soviet
technology such as Barauni Refinery and Gujarat Refinery, it also includes the
world's largest refinery complex in Jamnagar that processes 1.24 million
barrels of crude per day. By volume, the Indian chemical industry was the
third-largest producer in Asia, and contributed 5% of the country's GDP. India
is one of the five-largest producers of agrochemicals, polymers and plastics,
dyes and various organic and inorganic chemicals. Despite being a large
producer and exporter, India is a net importer of chemicals due to domestic
demands. India's chemical industry is extremely diversified and estimated at
$178 billion.

#### Chemicals and fertilizer

The chemical industry contributed $163 billion to the economy in FY18 and is
expected to reach $300–400 billion by 2025. The industry employed 17.33
million people (4% of the workforce) in 2016.

At present, 57 large fertilizer units are manufacturing a wide number of
nitrogen fertilizers. These include 29 urea-producing units and 9 ammonia
sulfate-producing units as a by-product. Besides, there are 64 small-scale
producing units of single super phosphate.

According to the latest data released by the WTO, India has emerged as the
second largest exporter of agrochemicals in the world. The rank was sixth, 10
years ago.The Indian agrochemical industry fetches valuable trade surplus
every year. The trade surplus sharply increased from Rs. 8,030 crores in
2017–18 to Rs. 28,908 crores in the last fiscal. India's agrochemicals export
has doubled in the last 6 years from $2.6 bn in 2017–18 to $5.4 bn in the last
financial year according to the data recently released by Ministry of
Commerce. It has grown at an impressive CAGR of 13% which is among the highest
in the manufacturing sector.

Millions of farmers in over 130 countries trust Indian agrochemicals for their
high quality and affordable prices, said an industry observer. With the global
agrochemicals market estimated at $78 billion, predominantly comprising post-
patent products, India is rapidly becoming a preferred global hub for sourcing
such agrochemicals. To bolster domestic production and reduce imports, the
Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI) has recommended specific measures to the
Government of India.

### Transportation

#### Railways and Logistics

Vande Bharat train

The Indian Railways contributes to ~3% of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP) and has social obligations pegged at $5.3 billion annually. Indian
Railways revenue has grown at 5% CAGR in the past 5 years but profitability
has reduced drastically in the past 4 years, due to growing infrastructure and
modernization expenses. With a workforce of 1.31 million people, the IR is
also one of the country's largest employers. The railways is a major
contributor to jobs, GDP, and mobility.

Indian Railways has decided to revise its 2022–23 rolling stock production
plan upwards. The Ministry's new plan targets the production of 8,429 units
for the coming financial year. Production for 2022–23 has been raised by 878
units from the earlier planned 7,551, according to the revised targets. Indian
Railways has targeted to manufacture 475 new Vande Bharat trainsets for the
next four years as a part of its modernization plan. It is about Rs 40,000
crore($5 billion) business opportunity that would also create 15,000 jobs and
several spin-off benefits. Indian Railway's CORE aims to electrify all of its
broad gauge network by 31 March 2024. The entire electrified mainline rail
network in India uses 25 kV AC; DC is used only for metros.As of July 2023,
India currently has 90% of total train tracks fully electrified.

Under the eleventh Five Year Plan of India (2007–12), the Ministry of Railways
started constructing a new Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) in two long
routes, namely the Eastern and Western freight corridors. The two routes cover
a total length of 3,260 kilometres (2,030 mi), with the _Eastern Dedicated
Freight Corridor_ stretching from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal
and the _Western Dedicated Freight Corridor_ from Jawaharlal Nehru Port in
Mumbai (Maharashtra) to Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. The DFC will generate around
42,000 jobs and provide long term employment to many people in public sector
and private sector.[_citation needed_]

#### Rapid Transit

As of 2024, India is having third largest metro system in the world

India is developing modern mass rapid transit systems to meet present and
future urban requirements. A modern metro rail system is already in place in
the cities of Navi Mumbai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad,
Kochi, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Noida, Pune, Nagpur, Kanpur, Ahmedabad and Lucknow.
Similar mass transit systems are intended for Agra, Bhopal, Indore, Surat,
Patna, Bhubaneswar Tri-city, Chandigarh Tri-city, Gwalior, Mysore, Nashik,
Prayagraj, Varanasi, Ranchi, Thane and Trivandrum. Former Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee has been credited with success of the metro systems in India
and every metro has followed Delhi Metro model generating lot of real estate
wealth in India specially in smaller cities like Gurgaon and Noida. For
Elevated corridor, there is no need for land acquisition as pillars are built
above Median strip of a road.[_citation needed_] Land prices in tier-II cities
such as Lucknow, Patna, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Pune, Kochi, and Coimbatore have
gone up by almost 8-10 percent following the introduction of a metro corridor
in these cities, an assessment by JLL has said.

India is also developing modern RRTS system to replace the old MRTS system
which will provide connectivity in Delhi Metropolitan Area and Mumbai
Metropolitan Region which will serve the suburbs of these big cities at 80–100
km of distance from city centre.[_citation needed_]

#### Aviation

India is the fourth-largest civil aviation market in the world recording an
air traffic of 158 million passengers in 2017. The market is estimated to have
800 aircraft by 2020, which would account for 4.3% of global volumes, and is
expected to record annual passenger traffic of 520 million by 2037. IATA
estimated that aviation contributed $30 billion to India's GDP in 2017, and
supported 7.5 million jobs – 390,000 directly, 570,000 in the value chain, and
6.2 million through tourism.

As of 2024, There are 75 new airports have been built in the last ten years,
taking the total count to 149 airports (include helipads and aerodromes).
Government vision is to take this milestone 149 to 220 airports in the next 5
to 7 years and Government of India has a Rs 1 lakh crore capex plan to spend
on Airport infrastructure.

#### Shipbuilding

The Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy (SBFAP) was introduced in 2016,
provides financial assistance to Indian shipyards for shipbuilding contracts.
According to the ministry of ports, shipping and waterways, under SBFAP, a
total of 313 domestic and export vessel orders were procured by 39 shipyards
since the inception of the scheme, with the total value standing at about
₹10,500 crore($1.26 billion).

India has multiple ship building companies such as Cochin Shipyard, Hindustan
Shipyard and Swan Defence and Heavy Industries, mainly produces ships for
European, South American and African shipping companies. Cochin shipyard is
the pioneer in autonomous electric propulsion ships.

### IT and telecommunications

#### Datacentre and cloud

India has emerged as the leading data centre hub in the Asia-Pacific region
(excluding China), surpassing established players like Singapore, Australia,
South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong in installed capacity. This reflects the
escalating demand for data services in one of the world's fastest-growing
major economies. With a current installed capacity of 950 MW and projections
indicating an additional 850 MW by 2026, India is poised to solidify its
position as a key player in the Asia-Pacific data centre landscape.

In Hyderabad, The largest datacentre is spread over 1. 31 lakh square feet,
the proposed rated-4 (tier-4) data centre will be equipped with 1,600 racks
and powered by 18MW of electricity.

India's overall public cloud services market is projected to hit US $13
billion by 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 23.1% in 2021-26. The market's revenue
totaled US $2.8 billion for the first half of 2022.

#### Telecommunications

INSAT-1B satellite: broadcasting sector in India is highly dependent on INSAT
system.

The telecommunication sector generated ₹2.20 trillion (US$26 billion) in
revenue in 2014–15, accounting for 1.94% of total GDP. Telecom equipment
manufacturing and exports are becoming a new success story following the
success of smartphone exports. In the financial year 2024, the telecom
equipment production exceeded the milestone of Rs 45,000 crore with exports
totaling approximately Rs 10,500 crore. India is the second-largest market in
the world by number of telephone users (both fixed and mobile phones) with
1.053 billion subscribers as of 31 August 2016.[update] It has one of the
lowest call-tariffs in the world, due to fierce competition among telecom
operators. India has the world's third-largest Internet user-base. As of 31
March 2016,[update] there were 342.65 million Internet subscribers in the
country. India's telecommunication industry is the world's second largest by
the number of mobile phone, smartphone, and internet users. It is the world's
24th-largest oil producer and the third-largest oil consumer.

Industry estimates indicate that there are over 554 million TV consumers in
India as of 2012.[update] India is the largest direct-to-home (DTH) television
market in the world by number of subscribers. As of May 2016,[update] there
were 84.80 million DTH subscribers in the country.

### Defence and energy

#### Defence

PAFC AIP fuel-cell module developed by the DRDO of India to power marine
transport

With over 1.3 million active personnel, the Indian Army is the third-largest
military force and the largest volunteer army. Defence expenditure was pegged
at US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than previous
fiscal year. India is the world's second largest arms importer; between 2016
and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total global arms imports. India
exported military hardware worth ₹159.2 billion (US$1.9 billion) in the
financial year 2022–23, the highest ever and a notable tenfold increase since
2016–17.

#### Diversified Energy sector

An IPHWR-700 reactor undergoing construction in Kakrapar Nuclear Plant started
in 1984

Primary energy consumption of India is the third-largest after China and US
with 5.3% global share in the year 2015. Coal and crude oil together account
for 85% of the primary energy consumption of India. India's oil reserves meet
25% of the country's domestic oil demand. As of April 2015,[update] India's
total proven crude oil reserves are 763.476 megatonnes (751.418 million long
tons; 841.588 million short tons), while gas reserves stood at 1,490 billion
cubic metres (53 trillion cubic feet). Oil and natural gas fields are located
offshore at Ashoknagar Oil Field, Bombay High, Krishna Godavari Basin, Mangala
Area and the Cauvery Delta, and onshore mainly in the states of West Bengal,
Assam, Gujarat and Rajasthan. India is the fourth-largest consumer of oil and
net oil imports were nearly ₹8.2 trillion (US$97 billion) in 2014–15, which
had an adverse effect on the country's current account deficit. The petroleum
industry in India mostly consists of public sector companies such as Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited
(HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation
Limited (IOCL). There are some major private Indian companies in the oil
sector such as Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) which operates the world's
largest oil refining complex.

India became the world's third-largest producer of electricity in 2013 with a
4.8% global share in electricity generation, surpassing Japan and Russia. By
the end of calendar year 2015, India had an electricity surplus with many
power stations idling for want of demand. The utility electricity sector had
an installed capacity of 303 GW as of May 2016[update] of which thermal power
contributed 69.8%, hydroelectricity 15.2%, other sources of renewable energy
13.0%, and nuclear power 2.1%. India meets most of its domestic electricity
demand through its 106 gigatonnes (104 billion long tons; 117 billion short
tons) of proven coal reserves. India is also rich in certain alternative
sources of energy with significant future potential such as solar, wind and
biofuels (jatropha, sugarcane). India's dwindling uranium reserves stagnated
the growth of nuclear energy in the country for many years. Recent discoveries
in the Tummalapalle belt may be among the top 20 natural uranium reserves
worldwide,[_needs update_] and an estimated reserve of 846,477 tonnes (833,108
long tons; 933,081 short tons) of thorium – about 25% of world's reserves –
are expected to fuel the country's ambitious nuclear energy programme in the
long run. The Indo-US nuclear deal has also paved the way for India to import
uranium from other countries.

over 22,600 kilometres (14,000 mi) of 4- or 6-lane highways, connecting most
of its major manufacturing, commercial and cultural centres. India's road
infrastructure carries 60% of freight and 87% of passenger traffic.

Delhi-Meerut Expressway is the 2nd widest 14 lane expressway after Dwarka
Expressway

India has a coastline of 7,500 kilometres (4,700 mi) with 13 major ports, 15
big private ports and 60 operational non-major ports, which together handle
95% of the country's external trade by volume and 70% by value (most of the
remainder handled by air). Kandla Port, New Kandla is the largest public port
established in early 1960's, while Mundra is the largest private sea port. The
airport infrastructure of India includes 125 airports, of which 66 airports
are licensed to handle both passengers and cargo. India has multiple global
infrastructure companies such as Afcons Infrastructure, Adani Group, JSW
Infrastructure, Larsen & Toubro etc.

The construction industry contributed $288 billion (13% of GDP) and employed
60.42 million people (14% of the workforce) in 2016. The construction and real
estate sector ranks third among the 14 major sectors in terms of direct,
indirect, and induced effects in all sectors of the economy.

The real estate sector will provide huge business opportunities, employment
and big avenues for startup ecosystem. The 2023 Union budget of India also
focused significantly on infrastructure with nearly ₹10 trillion direct
investment of central government.

India has MGNREGA scheme which provides employment to 80 million people and as
well as provides large infrastructure development. India is massively
privatizing airports, ports, bus stands, railway stations, dams, dam wind
park, solar parks, floating solar plants, power transmission, highways,
thermal power and other utilizes.

### Finance and trade

#### Banking and financial services

The financial services industry contributed $809 billion (37% of GDP) and
employed 14.17 million people (3% of the workforce) in 2016, and the banking
sector contributed $407 billion (19% of GDP) and employed 5.5 million people
(1% of the workforce) in 2016. The Indian money market is classified into the
organised sector, comprising private, public and foreign-owned commercial
banks and cooperative banks, together known as 'scheduled banks'; and the
unorganised sector, which includes individual or family-owned indigenous
bankers or money lenders and non-banking financial companies. The unorganised
sector and microcredit are preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-
urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes such as short-term loans
for ceremonies.

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 banks in 1969, followed by six
others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% of their net
credit to priority sectors including agriculture, small-scale industry, retail
trade and small business, to ensure that the banks fulfilled their social and
developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased
from 8,260 in 1969 to 72,170 in 2007 and the population covered by a branch
decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total bank
deposits increased from ₹59.1 billion (equivalent to ₹2.8 trillion or US$33
billion in 2023) in 1970–71 to ₹38.31 trillion (equivalent to ₹96 trillion or
US$1.1 trillion in 2023) in 2008–09. Despite an increase of rural branches –
from 1,860 or 22% of the total in 1969 to 30,590 or 42% in 2007 – only 32,270
of 500,000 villages are served by a scheduled bank.

India's gross domestic savings in 2006–07 as a percentage of GDP stood at a
high 32.8%. More than half of personal savings are invested in physical assets
such as land, houses, cattle, and gold. The government-owned public-sector
banks hold over 75% of total assets of the banking industry, with the private
and foreign banks holding 18.2% and 6.5% respectively. Since liberalisation,
the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these
relate to nationalised banks – such as reforms encouraging mergers, reducing
government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness –
other reforms have opened the banking and insurance sectors to private and
foreign companies.

#### Retail

Surat Diamond City Aerial View

The retail industry, excluding wholesale, contributed $793 billion (10% of
GDP) and employed 35 million people (8% of the workforce) in 2020. The
industry is the second largest employer in India, after agriculture. The
Indian retail market is estimated to be US$600 billion and one of the top-five
retail markets in the world by economic value. India has one of the fastest-
growing retail markets in the world, and is projected to reach $1.3 trillion
by 2020. India has retail market worth $1.17 trillion, which contributes over
10% of India's GDP. It also has one of the world's fastest growing e-commerce
markets. The e-commerce retail market in India was valued at $32.7 billion in
2018, and is expected to reach $71.9 billion by 2022.

India's retail industry mostly consists of local mom-and-pop stores, owner-
staffed shops and street vendors. Retail supermarkets are expanding, with a
market share of 4% in 2008. In 2012, the government permitted 51% FDI in
multi-brand retail and 100% FDI in single-brand retail. However, a lack of
back-end warehouse infrastructure and state-level permits and red tape
continue to limit growth of organised retail. Compliance with over thirty
regulations such as "signboard licences" and "anti-hoarding measures" must be
made before a store can open for business. There are taxes for moving goods
from state to state, and even within states.

### Industries

#### Tourism

Ayodhya became the top destination in 2024

The World Travel & Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹15.24
trillion (US$180 billion) or 9.4% of the nation's GDP in 2017 and supported
41.622 million jobs, 8% of its total employment. The sector is predicted to
grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 trillion (US$380 billion) by 2028
(9.9% of GDP). Over 10 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017
compared to 8.89 million in 2016, recording a growth of 15.6%. The tourism
industry contributes about 9.2% of India's GDP and employs over 42 million
people. India earned $21.07 billion in foreign exchange from tourism receipts
in 2015. International tourism to India has seen a steady growth from 2.37
million arrivals in 1997 to 8.03 million arrivals in 2015. Bangladesh is the
largest source of international tourists to India, while European Union
nations and Japan are other major sources of international tourists. In 2024,
Ayodhya, particularly with the Ram Temple became Uttar Pradesh's top tourist
destination, attracting more domestic and international visitors. Less than
10% of international tourists visit the Taj Mahal, with the majority visiting
other cultural, thematic and holiday circuits. Over 12 million Indian citizens
take international trips each year for tourism, while domestic tourism within
India adds about 740 million Indian travellers. India has a fast-growing
medical tourism sector of its health care economy, offering low-cost health
services and long-term care. In October 2015, the medical tourism sector was
estimated to be worth US$3 billion. It is projected to grow to $7–8 billion by
2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical
treatment.

#### Wedding Industry

India's wedding industry has a size of $75 billion, second largest after
China. It is the fourth largest industry in India. The wedding industry saw
significant growth in 2023 as weddings became larger and more extravagant post
the pandemic blues. Average guest size grew by nearly 15%, from 270 guests in
2022 to 310 in 2023. Celebrations also expanded, with couples now hosting an
average of 4.2 functions, up from 3.2.A significant 27 lakh weddings fall in
the ₹10-25 lakh range, reflecting the popularity of mid-range wedding budgets.
Smaller budgets like ₹3 lakh and ₹6 lakh account for 10 lakh weddings each,
while high-end weddings costing ₹1 crore or more make up 50,000 weddings.

India hosts the highest number of weddings in the world each year, as per
investment banking and capital market firm Jefferies. However, in terms of
market size, the Indian wedding industry is still smaller than China's but
almost twice as big as the US's.

#### Films, entertainment and music industry

The Indian cinema industry is expected to garner a revenue of around Rs 16,198
crore by 2026, of which Rs 15,849 would be Box office revenue and the rest Rs
349 crore from advertising, the report added. India's Recorded Music industry
(which is a key sub-segment) is making steady progress at a CAGR of 13.6
percent, thanks to streaming models.

## Security markets

The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) is the biggest stock exchange in
India by trading volume as 96% trading occurs in NSE

The development of Indian security markets began with the launch of the Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) in July 1875 and the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange in 1894.
Since then, 22 other exchanges have traded in Indian cities. In 2014, India's
stock exchange market became the 10th largest in the world by market
capitalisation, just above those of South Korea and Australia. India's two
major stock exchanges, BSE and the National Stock Exchange of India, had a
market capitalisation of US$1.71 trillion and US$1.68 trillion as of February
2015,[update] according to the World Federation of Exchanges, which grew to
$3.36 trillion and $3.31 trillion respectively by September 2021.

The initial public offering (IPO) market in India has been small compared to
NYSE and NASDAQ, raising US$300 million in 2013 and US$1.4 billion in 2012.
Ernst & Young stated that the low IPO activity reflects market conditions,
slow government approval processes, and complex regulations. Before 2013,
Indian companies were not allowed to list their securities internationally
without first completing an IPO in India. In 2013, these security laws were
reformed and Indian companies can now choose where they want to list first:
overseas, domestically, or both concurrently. Further, security laws have been
revised to ease overseas listings of already-listed companies, to increase
liquidity for private equity and international investors in Indian companies.

Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated
from world markets, to protect its economy and to achieve self-reliance.
Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative
restrictions, while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-
limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export
obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly
60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI
averaged only around $200 million annually between 1985 and 1991; a large
percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing
and deposits of non-resident Indians. India's exports were stagnant for the
first 15 years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by
the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early
industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and
consumer goods. Since liberalisation, the value of India's international trade
has increased sharply, with the contribution of total trade in goods and
services to the GDP rising from 16% in 1990–91 to 47% in 2009–10. Foreign
trade accounted for 48.8% of India's GDP in 2015. Globally, India accounts for
1.44% of exports and 2.12% of imports for merchandise trade and 3.34% of
exports and 3.31% of imports for commercial services trade. India's major
trading partners are the European Union, China, United States and United Arab
Emirates. In 2006–07, major export commodities included engineering goods,
petroleum products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery,
textiles and garments, agricultural products, iron ore and other minerals.
Major import commodities included crude oil and related products, machinery,
electronic goods, gold and silver. In November 2010, exports increased 22.3%
year-on-year to ₹851 billion (equivalent to ₹1.9 trillion or US$23 billion in
2023), while imports were up 7.5% at ₹1.25 trillion (equivalent to ₹2.8
trillion or US$33 billion in 2023). The trade deficit for the same month
dropped from ₹469 billion (equivalent to ₹1.2 trillion or US$14 billion in
2023) in 2009 to ₹401 billion (equivalent to ₹900 billion or US$11 billion in
2023) in 2010.

India is a founding-member of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
and its successor, the WTO. While participating actively in its general
council meetings, India has been crucial in voicing the concerns of the
developing world. For instance, India has continued its opposition to the
inclusion of labour, environmental issues and other non-tariff barriers to
trade in WTO policies.

India secured 43rd place in competitiveness index.

### Balance of payments

Cumulative current account balance 1980–2008 based on IMF data

Since independence, India's balance of payments on its current account has
been negative. Since economic liberalisation in the 1990s, precipitated by a
balance-of-payment crisis, India's exports rose consistently, covering 80.3%
of its imports in 2002–03, up from 66.2% in 1990–91. However, the global
economic slump followed by a general deceleration in world trade saw the
exports as a percentage of imports drop to 61.4% in 2008–09. India's growing
oil import bill is seen as the main driver behind the large current account
deficit, which rose to $118.7 billion, or 11.11% of GDP, in 2008–09. Between
January and October 2010, India imported $82.1 billion worth of crude oil. The
Indian economy has run a trade deficit every year from 2002 to 2012, with a
merchandise trade deficit of US$189 billion in 2011–12. Its trade with China
has the largest deficit, about $31 billion in 2013.

India's reliance on external assistance and concessional debt has decreased
since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from
35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, external commercial borrowings
(ECBs), or commercial loans from non-resident lenders, are being permitted by
the government for providing an additional source of funds to Indian
corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB
policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign
Exchange Management Act of 1999. India's foreign exchange reserves have
steadily risen from $5.8 billion in March 1991 to ₹38,832.21 billion (US$540
billion) in July 2020. In 2012, United Kingdom announced an end to all
financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.

India's current account deficit reached an all-time high in 2013. India has
historically funded its current account deficit through borrowings by
companies in the overseas markets or remittances by non-resident Indians and
portfolio inflows. From April 2016 to January 2017, RBI data showed that, for
the first time since 1991, India was funding its deficit through foreign
direct investment inflows. _The Economic Times_ noted that the development was
"a sign of rising confidence among long-term investors in Prime Minister
Narendra Modi's ability to strengthen the country's economic foundation for
sustained growth".

### Foreign direct investment

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to
reflect recent events or newly available information. _( October 2015)_  
---|---  
**Share of top five investing countries in FDI inflows (2000–2010)** Rank | Country | Inflows  
(million US$) | Inflows (%)   
---|---|---|---  
1 | Mauritius | 50,164 | 42.00   
2 | Singapore | 11,275 | 9.00   
3 | US | 8,914 | 7.00

5 | Netherlands | 4,968 | 4.00   
  
As the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms, India has attracted
foreign direct investment (FDI). During the year 2011, FDI inflow into India
stood at $36.5 billion, 51.1% higher than the 2010 figure of $24.15 billion.
India has strengths in telecommunication, information technology and other
significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels,
pharmaceuticals, and jewellery. Despite a surge in foreign investments, rigid
FDI policies were a significant hindrance. Over time, India has adopted a
number of FDI reforms. India has a large pool of skilled managerial and
technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population stands at 300
million and represents a growing consumer market.

India liberalised its FDI policy in 2005, allowing up to a 100% FDI stake in
ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial
licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy
access to foreign technology and investment. The upward growth curve of the
real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI
regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in
the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction
development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals,
educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-
level infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms to
defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.

From 2000 to 2010, the country attracted $178 billion as FDI. The inordinately
high investment from Mauritius is due to routing of international funds
through the country given significant tax advantages – double taxation is
avoided due to a tax treaty between India and Mauritius, and Mauritius is a
capital gains tax haven, effectively creating a zero-taxation FDI channel. FDI
accounted for 2.1% of India's GDP in 2015.

As the government has eased 87 foreign investment direct rules across 21
sectors in the last three years, FDI inflows hit $60.1 billion between 2016
and 2017 in India.

#### Outflows

Since 2000, Indian companies have expanded overseas, investing FDI and
creating jobs outside India. From 2006 to 2010, FDI by Indian companies
outside India amounted to 1.34 per cent of its GDP. Indian companies have
deployed FDI and started operations in United States, Europe and Africa. The
Indian conglomerate Tata Group is United Kingdom's largest manufacturer and
private-sector employer.

### Remittances

In 2015, a total of US$68.91 billion was made in remittances to India from
other countries, and a total of US$8.476 billion was made in remittances by
foreign workers in India to their home countries. UAE, US, and Saudi Arabia
were the top sources of remittances to India, while Bangladesh, Pakistan, and
Nepal were the top recipients of remittances from India. Remittances to India
accounted for 3.32% of the country's GDP in 2015.

### Mergers and acquisitions

Between 1985 and 2018 20,846 deals have been announced in, into (inbound) and
out of (outbound) India. This cumulates to a value of US$618 billion. In terms
of value, 2010 has been the most active year with deals worth almost 60 bil.
USD. Most deals have been conducted in 2007 (1,510).

Here is a list of the top 10 deals with Indian companies participating:

The Indian rupee (₹) is the only legal tender in India, and is also accepted
as legal tender in neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan, both of which peg their
currency to that of the Indian rupee. The rupee previously was divided into
100 paise, which no longer exist. The highest-denomination banknote was the
₹2,000 note until 30 September 2023 after which it was scrapped and ₹500 note
became the highest denomination; the lowest-denomination coin in circulation
is the ₹1 coin. In 2017, demonetisation was announced in which ₹500 and ₹1000
notes were withdrawn and new ₹500 notes were issued. India's monetary system
is managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the country's central bank.
Established on 1 April 1935 and nationalised in 1949, the RBI serves as the
nation's monetary authority, regulator and supervisor of the monetary system,
banker to the government, custodian of foreign exchange reserves, and as an
issuer of currency. It is governed by a central board of directors, headed by
a governor who is appointed by the Government of India. The benchmark interest
rates are set by the Monetary Policy Committee.

The rupee was linked to the British pound from 1927 to 1946, and then to US
dollar until 1975 through a fixed exchange rate. It was devalued in September
1975 and the system of fixed par rate was replaced with a basket of four major
international currencies: the British pound, US dollar, the Japanese yen and
the Deutsche Mark. In 1991, after the collapse of its largest trading partner,
the Soviet Union, India faced the major foreign exchange crisis and the rupee
was devalued by around 19% in two stages on 1 and 2 July. In 1992, a
Liberalized Exchange Rate Mechanism (LERMS) was introduced. Under LERMS,
exporters had to surrender 40 percent of their foreign exchange earnings to
the RBI at the RBI-determined exchange rate; the remaining 60% could be
converted at the market-determined exchange rate. In 1994, the rupee was
convertible on the current account, with some capital controls.

After the sharp devaluation in 1991 and transition to current account
convertibility in 1994, the value of the rupee has been largely determined by
market forces. The rupee has been fairly stable during the decade 2000–2010.
In October 2022, rupee touched an all-time low 83.29 to US dollar.

## Income and consumption

| This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to

---|---  
India vs world by nominal GDP per capita in 2025 Gini index of India compared
to other countries per World Bank data tables as of 2018[update]

India's gross national income per capita had experienced high growth rates
since 2002. It tripled from ₹19,040 in 2002–03 to ₹53,331 in 2010–11,
averaging 13.7% growth each of these eight years, with peak growth of 15.6% in
2010–11 and, growth in the inflation-adjusted per-capita income of the nation
slowed to 5.6% in 2010–11, down from 6.4% in the previous year. These
consumption levels are on an individual basis. The average family income in
India was $6,671 per household in 2011.

According to 2011 census data, India has about 330 million houses and 247
million households. The household size in India has dropped in recent years,
the 2011 census reporting 50% of households have four or fewer members, with
an average of 4.8 members per household including surviving grandparents.
These households produced a GDP of about $1.7 trillion. Consumption patterns
note: approximately 67% of households use firewood, crop residue, or cow-dung
cakes for cooking purposes; 53% do not have sanitation or drainage facilities
on premises; 83% have water supply within their premises or 100 metres (330
ft) from their house in urban areas and 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the house
in rural areas; 67% of the households have access to electricity; 63% of
households have landline or mobile telephone service; 43% have a television;
26% have either a two- or four-wheel motor vehicle. Compared to 2001, these
income and consumption trends represent moderate to significant improvements.
One report in 2010 claimed that high-income households outnumber low-income
households.

Countries by nominal GNI per capita according to the Atlas method (2016)

New World Wealth publishes reports tracking the total wealth of countries,
which is measured as the private wealth held by all residents of a country.
According to New World Wealth, India's total wealth increased from $3,165
billion in 2007 to $8,230 billion in 2017, a growth rate of 160%. India's
total wealth decreased by 1% from $8.23 trillion in 2017 to $8.148 trillion in
2018, making it the sixth wealthiest nation in the world. There are 20,730
multimillionaires (7th largest in the world) and 118 billionaires in India
(3rd largest in the world). With 327,100 high net-worth individuals (HNWI),
India is home to the 9th highest number of HNWIs in the world. Mumbai is the
wealthiest Indian city and the 12th wealthiest in the world, with a total net
worth of $941 billion in 2018. Twenty-eight billionaires reside in the city,
ranked ninth worldwide. As of December 2016,[update] the next wealthiest
cities in India were Delhi ($450 billion), Bengaluru ($320 billion), Hyderabad
($310 billion), Kolkata ($290 billion), Chennai ($200 billion), and Gurugram
($110 billion).

The _Global Wealth Migration Review_ _2019_ report, published by New World
Wealth, found that 5,000 HNWI's emigrated from India in 2018, or about 2% of
all HNWIs in the country. Australia, Canada, and United States were among the
top destination countries. The report also projected that private wealth in
India would grow by around 180% to reach $22,814 billion by 2028.

### Poverty

Poverty rate map of India by prevalence in 2012, among its states and union
territories

In May 2014, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to its poverty
calculation methodology of 2005 and purchasing-power-parity basis for
measuring poverty. According to the revised methodology, the world had 872.3
million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million lived in
India. With 17.5% of the total world's population, India had a 20.6% share of
the world's poorest in 2013. According to a 2005–2006 survey, India had about
61 million children under the age of 5 who were chronically malnourished. A
2011 UNICEF report stated that between 1990 and 2010, India achieved a 45
percent reduction in mortality rates under the age of 5, and now ranks 46th of
188 countries on this metric.

Since the early 1960s, successive governments have implemented various schemes
to alleviate poverty, under central planning, that have met with partial
success. In 2005, the government enacted the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), guaranteeing 100 days of minimum wage
employment to every rural household in all the districts of India. In 2011, it
was widely criticised and beset with controversy for corrupt officials,
deficit financing as the source of funds, poor quality of infrastructure built
under the programme, and unintended destructive effects. Other studies suggest
that the programme has helped reduce rural poverty in some cases. Yet other
studies report that India's economic growth has been the driver of sustainable
employment and poverty reduction, though a sizeable population remains in
poverty. India lifted 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016,
recording the fastest reductions in the multidimensional poverty index values
during the period with strong improvements in areas such as assets, cooking
fuel, sanitation, and nutrition.

On the 2019 Global Hunger Index India ranked 102nd (out of 117 countries) with
a score of 30.3, being categorized as 'serious' in severity. In 2024, India
ranked 105 (out of 127 countries) with a score of 27.3, indicating an
improvement in its hunger situation.

## Employment

India: extreme poverty rates from 1977 to 2021

Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 52% of the total workforce
in 2009–10. While agriculture employment has fallen over time in percentage of
labour employed, services which include construction and infrastructure have
seen a steady growth accounting for 20.3% of employment in 2012–13. Of the
total workforce, 7% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the
government-controlled public sector. About 51.2% of the workforce in India is
self-employed. Despite having one of the longest working hours, India has one
of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world. According to a
2005–06 survey, there is a gender gap in employment and salaries. In rural
areas, both men and women are primarily self-employed, mostly in agriculture.
In urban areas, salaried work was the largest source of employment for both
men and women in 2006.

### Unemployment

Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic (disguised) unemployment.
Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment –
which in recent decades has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into
urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt to solve the problem by
providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting
up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in
organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after
liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better
education and created political pressure for further reforms. India's labour
regulations are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts have
urged the government to abolish or modify them to make the environment more
conducive for employment generation. The 11th five-year plan has also
identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for employment
generation, by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic
clearances required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system
have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased
employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.

### Child labour

Child labour is a complex problem that is rooted in poverty. Since the 1990s,
the government has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child
labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch
programs, creating special investigation cells, etc. Author Sonalde Desai
stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some pockets of
industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively few Indian
children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now rare. In the
10–14 age group, the latest surveys find only 2% of children working for wage,
while another 9% work within their home or rural farms assisting their parents
in times of high work demand such as sowing and harvesting of crops.

### Diaspora remittance

India has the largest diaspora around the world, an estimated 32 million
people according to the Ministry of External Affairs (India), many of whom
work overseas and remit funds back to their families. The Middle East region
is the largest source of employment for expat Indians. The crude oil
production and infrastructure industry of Saudi Arabia employs over 2 million
expat Indians. Cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates have
employed another 2 million Indians during the construction boom in recent
decades. In 2009–10, remittances from Indian migrants overseas stood at ₹2.5
trillion (equivalent to ₹5.6 trillion or US$66 billion in 2023), the highest
in the world, but their share in FDI remained low at around 1%.

### Trade unions

In India, the Trade Union movement is generally divided on political lines.
According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, trade unions
had a combined membership of 24,601,589 in 2002. As of 2008, there are 12
Central Trade Union Organisations (CTUO) recognized by the Ministry of Labour.
The forming of these unions was a big deal in India. It led to a big push for
more regulatory laws which gave workers a lot more power.

AITUC is the oldest trade union in India. It is a left supported organization.
A trade union with nearly 2,000,000 members is the Self Employed Women's
Association (SEWA) which protects the rights of Indian women working in the
informal economy. In addition to the protection of rights, SEWA educates,
mobilizes, finances, and exalts their members' trades. Multiple other
organizations represent workers. These organizations are formed upon different
political groups. These different groups allow different groups of people with
different political views to join a Union.

Corruption has been a pervasive problem in India. A 2005 study by Transparency
International (TI) found that more than half of those surveyed had first-hand
experience of paying a bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a
public office in the previous year. A follow-up study in 2008 found this rate
to be 40 percent. In 2011, TI ranked India at 95th place amongst 183 countries
in perceived levels of public sector corruption. By 2016, India saw a
reduction in corruption, and its ranking improved to 79th place.

In 1996, red tape, bureaucracy, and the Licence Raj were suggested as a cause
for the institutionalised corruption and inefficiency. More recent reports
suggest the causes of corruption include excessive regulations and approval
requirements, mandated spending programs, monopoly of certain goods and
service providers by government-controlled institutions, bureaucracy with
discretionary powers, and lack of transparent laws and processes.

Computerisation of services, various central and state vigilance commissions,
and the 2005 Right to Information Act – which requires government officials to
furnish information requested by citizens or face punitive action – have
considerably reduced corruption and opened avenues to redress grievances.

In 2011, the Indian government concluded that most spending fails to reach its
intended recipients, as the large and inefficient bureaucracy consumes
budgets. India's absence rates are among the worst in the world; one study
found that 25% of public sector teachers and 40% of government-owned public-
sector medical workers could not be found at the workplace. Similarly, many
issues are facing Indian scientists, with demands for transparency, a
meritocratic system, and an overhaul of the bureaucratic agencies that oversee
science and technology.

India has an underground economy, with a 2006 report alleging that India
topped the worldwide list for black money with almost $1,456 billion stashed
in Swiss banks. This would amount to 13 times the country's total external
debt. These allegations have been denied by the Swiss Banking Association.
James Nason, the Head of International Communications for the Swiss Banking
Association, suggested "The (black money) figures were rapidly picked up in
the Indian media and in Indian opposition circles, and circulated as gospel
truth. However, this story was a complete fabrication. The Swiss Bankers
Association never published such a report. Anyone claiming to have such
figures (for India) should be forced to identify their source and explain the
methodology used to produce them." A Step was taken by Prime Minister Modi, on
8 November 2016, involved the demonetization of all 500 and 1000 rupee bank
notes (replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes) to return black money into
the economy followed by criticism that the measure was deemed ineffective by
economists and negatively affected the poorest people of India. This
demonetisation together with the introduction of The goods and services
tax(GST) is believed to be responsible for the slowdown in growth.

### Education

University of Calcutta, established in 1857, was the first multidisciplinary
and secular Western-style institution in Asia.

India has made progress in increasing the primary education attendance rate
and expanding literacy to approximately three-fourths of the population.
India's literacy rate had grown from 52.2% in 1991 to 74.04% in 2011. The
right to education at the elementary level has been made one of the
fundamental rights under the Eighty-Sixth Amendment of 2002, and legislation
has been enacted to further the objective of providing free education to all
children. However, the literacy rate of 74% is lower than the worldwide
average, and the country suffers from a high drop-out rate. Literacy rates and
educational opportunities vary by region, gender, urban and rural areas, and
among different social groups.

### Economic disparities

per capita, PPP basis, and GDP per capita basis in 2011

> Poverty rates in India's poorest states are three to four times higher than

A critical problem facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional
variations among India's different states and territories in terms of poverty,
availability of infrastructure, and socio-economic development. Six low-income
states – Assam, Chhattisgarh, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttar
Pradesh – are home to more than one-third of India's population. Severe
disparities exist among states in terms of income, literacy rates, life
expectancy, and living conditions. The four states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu,
Gujarat and Karnataka alone are projected to account for almost 50% of India's
GDP by 2030; the five South Indian states are projected to contribute 35% of
India's GDP by 2030 despite currently having 20% of India's population.

The five-year plans, especially in the pre-liberalisation era, attempted to
reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the
interior regions and distributing industries across states. The results have
been discouraging as these measures increased inefficiency and hampered
effective industrial growth. The more advanced states have been better placed
to benefit from liberalisation, with well-developed infrastructure and an
educated and skilled workforce, which attract the manufacturing and service
sectors. Governments of less-advanced states have tried to reduce disparities
by offering tax holidays and cheap land and focused on sectors like tourism,
which can develop faster than other sectors. India's income Gini coefficient
is 33.9, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),
indicating overall income distribution to be more uniform than East Asia,
Latin America, and Africa. The _Global Wealth Migration Review_ _2019_ report,
published by New World Wealth, estimated that 48% of India's total wealth was
held by high-net-worth individuals. According to a 2021 report by the Pew
Research Center, India has roughly 1.2 billion lower-income individuals, 66
million middle-income individuals, 16 million upper-middle-income individuals,
and 2 million in the high-income group. As per _The Economist_ , 78 million of
India's population are considered middle class as of 2017, if defined using
the cutoff of those making more than $10 per day, a standard used by the
India's National Council of Applied Economic Research.

There is a continuing debate on whether India's economic expansion has been
pro-poor or anti-poor. Studies suggest that economic growth has been pro-poor
and has reduced poverty in India.

### Climate change

Several banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC
Bank have taken the lead in funding green projects even as the Reserve Bank of
India comes up with norms for lenders to disclose their actions on climate
risk. RBI in an earlier report in 2022, had said that climate change would
require "intensive capital mobilisation" for that India needs $17.77 trillion.

The RBI recommends that regulated entities rely upon the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, the most prominent
climate disclosure framework globally, at least at the initial stage.

India is home to 75 per cent of the world's wild tiger population.The big cats
like lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, snow leopard, jaguar and puma were on the
brink of extinction. With hunting and encroachment, their numbers dropped to a
mere 20. Efforts to save the lion started before Independence but it was in
1965 that the Indian Forest Service stepped in to set up a conservation
programme.Researchers believe a combination of factors is driving the
unprecedented migration in tigers. Rising temperatures due to climate change
are making the lower foothills less hospitable.
