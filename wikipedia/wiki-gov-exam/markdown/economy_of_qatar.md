of Qatar.

The **economy of Qatar** is one of the highest in the world based on GDP per
capita, ranking generally among the top ten richest countries on world
rankings for 2015 and 2016 data compiled by the World Bank, the United
Nations, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country's economy has
grown despite sanctions by its neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. Mainly because the country exports primarily to Japan, South Korea,
India and China, making the sanctions effectively redundant as neither Saudi
Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates have imposed trading penalties such as
tariffs or embargoes on any of these countries for trading with Qatar, or
offering incentives such as discounts for their own energy exports to reduce
Qatari exports.

Petroleum and natural gas are the cornerstones of Qatar's economy and account
for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of gross domestic
product, and roughly 85% of export earnings. Qatar has the world's third
largest proven natural gas reserve and is the third-largest exporter of
natural gas.

Qatar’s economy has been shaped by a unique development model that leverages
revenues from its natural gas and oil sectors to drive modernization and
economic diversification. Through initiatives like Qatar National Vision 2030,
the country aims to reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons while promoting
sustainability, human development, and private sector growth. This strategy
includes significant investment in state-led projects, such as infrastructure
development and sovereign wealth funds, which have supported diversification
and global competitiveness. Qatar’s approach distinguishes it from traditional
resource-dependent states by prioritizing strategic investments and fostering
a diversified, knowledge-based economy. This model emphasizes sustainability,
innovation, and global competitiveness, reflecting a long-term commitment to
development and economic resilience that extends beyond reliance on natural
resource wealth.

Before the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving
country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939. In 1973, oil
production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks
of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per
capita incomes in the world.

Qatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price
for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets
reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to
be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business
climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy
recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and
South Asia, have grown again.

Oil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000
m3) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023.
However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast
coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and
condensate reserves. For example, the state owned QatarEnergy corporation
found two offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too
expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years
later.

The gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised
refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to
use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3
blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities
(PS-1, ALK, K & A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture
production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d). Like
with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and
could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023
is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore
exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in
June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from
February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids
together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.

Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding
7000 km3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by
completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In
1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to
Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of
dollars are in various stages of planning and development.

Qatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery
with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m3) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea
and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries
use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms
and the state-owned QatarEnergy corporation (formerly QGPC). The U.S. is the
major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies
are playing a major role in North Field gas development.

Qatar pursues a vigorous program of "Qatarization", under which all joint
venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals
into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated
Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key
positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of
expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign
manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis
for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.

## Industry

The government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to
diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve
as the primary feed stock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has
gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has
been clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed
Industrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen
considerable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of
petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed
only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's
largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-
largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about
7.5% of GDP. Industry in Qatar is regulated by the Ministry of Business and
Trade.

Petrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the
industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through
Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past
few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the
development boom swept the Persian Gulf region. The 2008 financial crisis
reduced demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor
sentiment remains cautious. The crisis impacted the whole of the industrial
sector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than
90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector
has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of
$2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital
investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example,
is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead.

### North Field LNG project

On 8 February 2021, the world's largest LNG supplier, Qatar Petroleum (now
QatarEnergy), signed an EPC-contract with Chiyoda and Technip for the North
Field East (NFE) expansion project to increase QE's annually LNG output by 40%
until 2026. For the $28.7 billion NFE expansion project, QatarEnergy has
partnered with five global energy companies that have acquired 25% stake in
the project. These include Shell, TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil, each with
6.25%, and Eni and ConocoPhillips, each with 3.125% stakes. In a first phase,
LNG export capacity is expected to increase from 77 million tons per year to
110 million tons per year by 2026.

On 20 June 2022, Minister of State for Energy Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said at a
press conference at the QatarEnergy that the expected production increase from
this project will be 32.6 million tonnes annually. Ethane produced from the
project would be 1.5 million tonnes per year, LPG 4 million tonnes per year,
250.000 barrels of condensate and 5.000 tonnes of helium per day.

In a second phase, the North Field South (NFS) project, Shell and
TotalEnergies have each acquired 9.375% and ConocoPhillips 6.25% stakes.
QatarEnergy plans to increase LNG production with the NFS project to 126
million tons per year beginning in 2028.

In April 2023, Sinopec acquired a 5% stake in an 8 million tonnes per year LNG
train.

The Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global
subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks.
Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in
the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008.
But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer
confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks’
positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that
it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by
way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and
an additional 5% at the end of 2009.

The Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy
the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to
continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the
Qatar Central Bank's (QCB's) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-
deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar's
economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in
business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar's banking
sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in
other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its
previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds
around the globe.

The International Monetary Fund in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar
has "successfully absorbed the shocks" of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the
dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. S&P Global had marked Qatar's outlook to
negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.

In August 2019, Qatar Central Bank stated that the country's economic growth
will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil
prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average
rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35
billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.

Qatar's GDP is anticipated to scale up to $208 billion in 2024 from $162
billion in 2022, according to a report by FocusEconomics. The World Bank has
projected Qatar's economy to be the fastest growing in the GCC in 2023 and
2024.

### Islamic finance

The Islamic finance sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected
to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments
spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar
Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer
Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-
compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual
necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take
the lion's share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks
are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic
banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters
of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared
to the same period in the previous year. The 2008 financial crisis slowed this
growth. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of
Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But
other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar
downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of
qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking
services.

### Capital market

The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Qatar was valued at
$95,487 million in 2007 by the World Bank. As 2008 drew to a close, no capital
markets around the globe, including Qatar's, were immune to the effects of the
sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's
bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to
the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough
trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008,
before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008
the DSM Index rose about 117% before the 2008 financial crisis wiped out most
of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its
value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in
February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks
amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. The move improved
investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The
proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all
banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that
will transform the financial sector for the better.

## Travel and tourism

The Pearl Qatar

Under the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and
Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of
visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet
this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some
$17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated
towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with
a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel
capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has
also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector
activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the Hamad International
Airport, which has the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers.

Qatar Airways is an airline owned by the Qatar government and was founded in
1993. It travels to over a hundred destinations.

Other niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism
on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha's Museum of Islamic Art, and
sports tourism, initially spurred by the Asian Games, to which Qatar played
host in 2006. Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World cup,

## Transport

Highway Q3 (from Doha to Dukhan)

With a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past
decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming
increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary
transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new
transportation options. In 2008 the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), one of
the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major
reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in
preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near
future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development
Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan,
instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.[_citation needed_]

Scene in the harbour of Al Khor. Fisheries is a minor sector in Qatar, and
production is almost exclusively for domestic consumption.

As driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a
major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the
multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway, which will
connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in
regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-
rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to
ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly
expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network
linking all of the six member states. The airport, too, is expanding capacity
to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The New Doha International Airport is
one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m
passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an
integral part of Qatar's economic development as it focuses on LNG and
industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the
2008 financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development,
once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and
modern transport infrastructures in the region.[_citation needed_]

## Macro-economic trend

Qatar is now among the richest countries in the world, on a per person basis.
Current GDP per capita registered a world record-breaking peak growth of
1,156% in the 70s. This became quickly unsustainable due to the 1980s oil
glut, and Qatar's current GDP per capita contracted 53% in the 80s. But rising
global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s.
Despite efforts to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and diversify the
economy from hydrocarbons to knowledge-based sectors, the oil and gas sector
has consistently contributed to at least 80 percent of the government of
Qatar’s total revenues since 2014, as well as 90 percent of Qatar’s total
exports.

In 2020 GDP PPP ~260 billion dollars.

This table is of Qatar's gross domestic product at market prices as estimated

In February 2012, the International Bank of Qatar reported that GDP grew by
19.9% in 2011, but estimated that 2012 growth would slow to 9.8%

According to the International Monetary Fund, Qatar's economic performance
improved in 2018 despite the economic embargo. The GDP growth is expected to
increase to 2.6% in 2019 from 2.2% in 2018.
