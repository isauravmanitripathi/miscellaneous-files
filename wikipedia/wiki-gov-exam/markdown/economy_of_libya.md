The **economy of Libya** depends primarily on revenues from the petroleum
sector, which represents over 95% of export earnings and 60% of GDP. These oil
revenues and a small population have given Libya one of the highest nominal
per capita GDP in Africa.

After 2000, Libya recorded favorable growth rates with an estimated 10.6%
growth of GDP in 2010. This development was interrupted by the Libyan Civil
War, which resulted in contraction of the economy by 62.1% in 2011. After the
war, the economy rebounded by 104.5% in 2012. It crashed again following the
Second Libyan Civil War. As of 2024, Libya's per capita PPP GDP stands at only
65% of its pre-war level in 2010.

## Macroeconomic trends

Libyan GDP per capita was about $40 in the early 1920s and it rose to $1,018
by 1967. In 1947 alone, per capita GDP rose by 42 percent.

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF
staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation below 5% is in green. The annual
unemployment rate is extracted from the World Bank, although the International
Monetary Fund find them unreliable.

## Oil sector

Development of oil production in Libya

Libya is an OPEC member and holds the largest proven oil reserves in Africa
(followed by Nigeria and Algeria), 41.5 Gbbl (6.60×109 m3) as of January 2007,
up from 39.1 Gbbl (6.22×109 m3) in 2006. About 80% of Libya's proven oil
reserves are located in the Sirte Basin, which is responsible for 90% of the
country's oil output. The state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) dominates
Libya's oil industry, along with smaller subsidiaries, which combined account
for around 50% of the country's oil output. Among NOC's subsidiaries, the
largest oil producer is the Waha Oil Company (WOC), followed by the Agoco,
Zueitina Oil Company (ZOC), and Sirte Oil Company (SOC). Oil resources, which
account for approximately 95% of export earnings, 75% of government receipts,
and over 50% of GDP. Oil revenues constitute the principal foreign exchange
source. Reflecting the heritage of the command economy, three-quarters of
employment is in the public sector, and private investment remains small at
around 2% of GDP.

Falling world oil prices in the early 1980s and economic sanctions caused a
serious decline in economic activity, eventually leading to a slow private
sector rehabilitation. At 2.6% per year on average, real GDP growth was modest
and volatile during the 1990s. Libya's GDP grew in 2001 due to high oil
prices, the end of a long cyclical drought, and increased foreign direct
investment following the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999. Real GDP growth
has been boosted by high oil revenues, reaching 4.6% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.
Despite efforts to diversify the economy and encourage private sector
participation, extensive controls of prices, credit, trade, and foreign
exchange constrain growth.

Although UN sanctions were suspended in 1999, foreign investment in the Libyan
gas and oil sectors were severely curtailed due to the U.S. Iran and Libya
Sanctions Act (ILSA), which capped the amount foreign companies can invest in
Libya yearly at $20 million (lowered from $40 million in 2001). As of May
2006, the U.S. has removed Libya from its list of states that sponsor
terrorism and has normalised ties and removed sanctions. This clears the road
for U.S. oil companies to exploit Libyan oil and is expected to have a
positive impact on the Libyan economy. [1]

The NOC hopes to raise oil production from 1.80 million bpd in 2006 to 2
million bpd by 2008. FDI into the oil sector is likely, which is attractive
due to its low cost of oil recovery, high oil quality, and proximity to
European markets. Most Libyan oil is sold on a term basis, including to the
country's Oilinvest marketing network in Europe; to companies like Agip, OMV,
Repsol YPF, Tupras, CEPSA, and Total; and small volumes to Asian and South
African companies.

### Field Development and Exploration

Oil is Libya's major resource.

In November 2005, Repsol YPF discovered a significant oil deposit of light,
sweet crude in the Murzuq Basin. Industry experts believe the discovery to be
one of the biggest made in Libya for several years. Repsol YPF is joined by a
consortium of partners including OMV, Total and Norsk Hydro. Also located in
Murzuq Basin is Eni's Elephant field. In October 1997, a consortium led by
British company Lasmo, along with Eni and a group of five South Korean
companies, announced that it had discovered large recoverable crude reserves
about 800 kilometres (500 mi) south of Tripoli. Lasmo estimated field
production would cost around $1 per barrel. Elephant began production in
February 2004.

WOC's Waha fields currently produce around 350,000 bbl/d (56,000 m3/d). In
2005, ConocoPhillips and co-venturers reached an agreement with NOC to return
to its operations in Libya and extend the Waha concession 25 years.
ConocoPhillips operates the Waha fields with a 16.33% share in the project.
NOC has the largest share of the Waha concession, and additional partners
include Marathon and Amerada Hess.

### Refining and Downstream

Libya has five domestic refineries:

Refinery | Capacity | Operator   
---|---|---  
Zawia Refinery | 120,000 | ZOC   
Ras Lanuf Refinery | 220,000 | Ras Lanuf   
El-Brega Refinery | 10,000 | SOC   
Tobruk Refinery | 20,000 | Agoco   
Sarir Refinery | 10,000 | Agoco

## Diversification

to pursue extravagant projects such as agriculture and the Great Manmade River
in the Sahara Desert. Modern buildings in Tripoli before the wars, 2009

In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 percent
of the Libyan economy.[_citation needed_] Diversification of the economy into
manufacturing industries remain a long-term issue.

Although agriculture is the second-largest sector in the economy, Libya
depends on imports in most foods. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
limit farm output, and domestic food production meets only about 25% of
demand. Domestic conditions limit output, while higher incomes and a growing
population have caused food consumption to rise. Because of low rainfall
levels in Libya, agricultural projects such as the Kufra oasis rely on
underground water sources. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains
the Great Manmade River (GMMR), but significant resources are being invested
in desalinization research to meet growing demand. Libyan agricultural
projects and policies are overseen by a General Inspector; there is no
Ministry of Agriculture, _per se_.

Libya produced in 2018:

  * 348 thousand tons of potato;
  * 236 thousand tons of watermelon;
  * 215 thousand tons of tomato;
  * 188 thousand tons of olive;
  * 183 thousand tons of onion;
  * 176 thousand tons of date;
  * 138 thousand tons of wheat;
  * 93 thousand tons of barley;
  * 72 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 60 thousand tons of plum;
  * 53 thousand tons of orange;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

## Tourism

The tourism industry was heavily hit by the Libyan Civil War. Before the war
tourism was developing, with 149,000 tourists visiting Libya in 2004, rising
to 180,000 in 2007, although this still only contributed less than 1% of the
country's GDP. There were 1,000,000 day visitors in the same year. The country
is best known for its ancient Greek and Roman ruins and Sahara desert
landscapes.

## Labor market

Libya posted a 3.3% rate of population growth during 1960–2003. In 2003, 86%
of the population was urban, compared to 45% in 1970. Although no reliable
estimates are available, unemployment is reportedly acute: over 50% of the
population under the age of 20. Moreover, despite the bias of labor market
regulations favoring Libyan workers, the mismatch of the educational system
with market demand has produced a large pool of expatriate workers, with
typically better-suited education and higher productivity. However, because of
shortages for manual labor, Libya has also attracted important numbers of less
skilled immigrants. Expatriate workers represent an estimated fifth of the
labor force.

Although significant, the proportion of expatriate workers is still below oil
producing countries in the Persian Gulf. Foreign workers mainly come from the
Maghreb, Egypt, Turkey, India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,
Poland, Chad, Sudan, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They tend to earn relatively
high wages, taking either skilled or hard manual jobs. Census data for 2000
show the share of expatriates earning over LD 300 (US$230) per month was 20%,
compared to 12% for Libyan nationals. A campaign encouraging conversion of
qualified civil servants to entrepreneurs, in the face of public sector over
employment and declining productivity, does not seem to be producing the
desired results thus far.

## External trade and finance

Libyan export destinations in 2006.

The Government is in the process of preparing a financial sector reform
program. Recent legislation setting corporate governance standards for
financial institutions makes progress towards better management and greater
operational independence of public banks. However, Libyan public banks still
lack management structures supported by skills in critical areas like credit,
investment, risk management, and information and control systems.

The new banking law reinforces the independence of the Central Bank of Libya
(CBL) and offers a legal framework for regulating banking activities, even if
some provisions call for improvement. Despite progress brought by the new
banking Law that specifies and limits its duties and responsibilities, the CBL
remains the owner of the public banks, with the associated potential conflict
of interest between ownership and regulation.

Financial sector reform has also progressed with partial interest rate
liberalization. Interest rates have been liberalized on deposits, while a
lending rate ceiling has been set above the discount rate. The Libyan Stock
Exchange, established in 2007, is the first exchange of its kind in the
country.

In 2011, Libya Oil Holdings had its €38m stake in Irish exploration firm
Circle Oil frozen on foot of a European Union order that's been put in place
to put pressure on the Gaddafi regime.
