The **economy of the Bahamas** is dependent upon tourism and offshore banking.
The Bahamas is the richest country in the West Indies.[_citation needed_] It
is a stable, developing nation in the Lucayan Archipelago, with a population
of 391,232 (2016). Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in
construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP
growth for many years. The slowdown in the Economy of the United States and
the September 11 attacks held back growth in these sectors from 2001 to 2003.

Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian
economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when
the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many
international businesses have left the Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture
together contribute approximately 10% of GDP and show little growth, despite
government incentives for those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short
run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on
growth in the United States, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In
addition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a
"2nd-pillar", e-commerce.

## Features of the Bahamian economy

The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial
services to generate foreign exchange earnings. The Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of the Bahamas is approximately $5.7 billion with tourism accounting for
50%, financial services nearly 20% and the balance spread among retail and
wholesale trade, fishing, light manufacturing and agriculture. The European
Union lists the Bahamas as one of several Caribbean "uncooperative
jurisdictions" because it fails to meet tax fairness and transparency
benchmarks.

### Tourism

Tourism alone provides an estimated 51% of the gross domestic product (GDP)
and employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2016, over 3 million
tourists visited the Bahamas, most of whom are from the United States and
Canada.

A major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is
Kerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former
Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In
addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this
turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to
courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the
Far East, Europe, Latin America, and Canada. The primary purpose of the trips
was to restore the reputation of the Bahamas in these markets.

Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian
economy, accounting for up to 17% of GDP, due to the country's status as an
offshore financial center. As of December 1998, 418 banks and trust companies
have been licensed in the Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International
Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status
as a leading financial center. The Act simplified and reduced the cost of
incorporating offshore companies in the Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than
100,000 IBC-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the
government also legalized the establishment of Asset Protection Trusts in the
Bahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary FATF
Blacklist, the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the
financial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and
enforcement of "know-your-customer" rules. Other initiatives include the
enactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of
legislation to regulate Private Trust Companies. After being later off the
blacklist, in December 2020 Bahamas also was taken off the FATF greylist.

Agriculture and fisheries industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas
exports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially.
There is no large scale agriculture, and most agricultural products are
consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in
foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The
government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate
foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing
agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government
officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts,
dairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the
areas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment.

The Bahamian Government maintains the value of the Bahamian dollar on a par
with the U.S. dollar. The Bahamas is a beneficiary of the U.S.-Caribbean Basin
Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), Canada's CARIBCAN program, and the European
Union's Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political
aspects of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint
economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.

### Industry

The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical
firm, PharmaChem Technologies (GrandBahama) Ltd. (formerly Syntex); the BORCO
oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the
Commonwealth Brewery in Nassau, which produces Heineken, Guinness, and Kalik
beers; and Bacardi Corp., which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the
U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in
Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and
mining of aragonite—a type of limestone with several industrial uses—from the
sea floor at Ocean Cay. Other smaller but more nimble players in the banking
industry include Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) Ltd. (FBB) and Royal Fidelity
Merchant Bank & Trust Limited (RFMBT). FBB offers a wide range of innovative
banking products including loan products with built-in savings plans. RFMBT is
the only merchant bank in the Bahamas and is a joint venture with Royal Bank
of Canada. It provides investment products and services and attracts the
majority of the corporate business deals in the Bahamas, most recently acting
as financial advisor and placement agent for the largest initial public
offering (IPO) ever in the Bahamas with the IPO of Commonwealth Brewery, a
Heineken subsidiary.

The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, the
Bahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage
foreign industrial investment. The Hong Kong-based firm, Hutchison Whampoa,
has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved
legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions
through 2054.

## Taxation

The Bahamas has no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth
tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by
the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer. In 2010, overall tax revenue was
17.2% of GDP. A value-added tax (VAT) of 7.5% has been levied 1 January 2015.
It then increased from 7.5% to 12% effective from 1 July 2018.
