After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950,
Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs
Union in 1995 and started full membership negotiations with the European Union
in 2005.

The **economy of Turkey** is an emerging free-market economy. It ranked as the
16th-largest in the world and 7th-largest in Europe by nominal GDP in 2025. It
also ranked as the 12th-largest in the world and 5th-largest in Europe by PPP
in 2025. Turkey's rapid economic growth since the 2000s was stranded by the
economic crisis in 2018, but it began to recover in 2021. Turkey's USD-based
nominal GDP per capita and GDP-PPP per capita have eventually reached their
all-time peak values in 2024.

Turkey is a founding member of the OECD and G20. Ratified in 1995, the
European Union–Turkey Customs Union has established a free trade area between
Turkey and the European Union, which has increased bilateral foreign trade,
investment and economic activity.

As the fifth most visited destination in the world, Turkey has a large tourism
industry, which accounted for 12% of the country's total GDP in 2023. First
established in 2000, many technoparks were pioneered by Turkish universities,
now hosting over 1,600 R&D centers that drew investment by both domestic and
international corporations. Turkey is also among the world's leading producers
of motor vehicles, consumer electronics, home appliances and defense products.
In 2021, the country was ranked eighth in the world in the technology rankings
of the Economic Complexity Index.

In the first quarter of the 21st century, there have been major developments
in the financial and social aspects of Turkey's economy, such as increases in
employment and average income since 2000. A period of strong economic growth
between 2002 and 2013 (except for 2009 due to the 2008 financial crisis) was
followed by a period of stagnation and recession in terms of USD-based nominal
GDP figures between 2014 and 2020, especially during the 2018 Turkish currency
and debt crisis; even though Turkey's USD-based GDP-PPP and TL-based nominal
GDP have continued to grow in this period. Since 2021, there has been a steady
recovery and rapid growth in Turkey's USD-based nominal GDP and GDP-PPP
figures, which have reached their all-time highest values in both 2023 and
2024.

Growth-focused and populistic financial policies, such as the preference to
keep interest rates as low as possible (dubbed _Erdoganomics_) have led to one
of the world's highest inflation rates since 2018. Following the Turkish
parliamentary and presidential elections on May 14 and 28, 2023, and the
appointment of Mehmet Şimşek as the Minister of Treasury and Finance on June
4, 2023, Turkey has adopted a more orthodox monetary policy regarding interest
rates and has succeeded in gradually decreasing inflation from 85.5% in late
2022 to 42.1% in early 2025.

## Main economic sectors

As of November 2023, there are 1,086,670 registered companies based in Turkey.
The sector with the highest number of companies registered in the country is
manufacturing with 241,362 companies. This is followed by wholesale trading
and services with 197,476 and 187,325 companies respectively.

### Agricultural sector

The Atatürk Dam is the largest of the 22 dams in the Southeastern Anatolia
Project. The program includes 22 dams, 19 hydraulic power plants, and the
irrigation of 1.82 million hectares of land. The total cost of the project is
estimated at $32 billion.

Agriculture is still an important sector of Turkey's economy, and the country
is one of the world's top ten agricultural producers. Wheat, sugar beet, milk,
poultry, cotton, vegetables and fruit are major products; and Turkey is the
world's largest grower of hazelnuts, apricots, and oregano.

Half of Turkey's land is agricultural, and farming employs about 15% of the
workforce, but under half a million farmers. It provides about 10% of exports
and over 5% of gross domestic product (GDP). Over 380 billion lira of
agricultural subsidy is budgeted for 2024.

Despite being a major food producer, Turkey is a net wheat importer, much of
it coming from Russia and Ukraine. Turkey is the European Union's fourth
largest vegetable supplier and seventh largest fruit supplier. Turkey would
like to extend the EU Customs Union Agreement to agricultural products.

Around half of Turkey's agricultural greenhouse gas is due to cattle.
According to the World Bank, the sector should adapt more to climate change in
Turkey and make technical improvements. Strategic planning is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, but no plan for
2024 onwards has yet been published. Almost all the seeds used in Turkey are
produced domestically.

### Industrial sector

---|---  
  
Heavy industry is tending to move out of the EU due to Turkey’s laxer
pollution regulations and cheaper energy.

#### Consumer electronics and home appliances

Turkey's Vestel is the largest TV producer in Europe, accounting for a quarter
of all TV sets manufactured and sold on the continent in 2006. By January
2005, Vestel and its rival Turkish electronics and white goods brand Beko
accounted for more than half of all TV sets manufactured in Europe. Another
Turkish electronics brand, Profilo Telra, was Europe's third-largest TV
producer in 2005.

#### Textiles and clothing

The Turkish textile is the world's fifth largest exporter, accounting for 10%
of the country's GDP and employing 750 000 people in 2018. Turkish companies
made clothing exports worth $13.98 billion in 2006; more than $10.67 billion
of which (76.33%) were exported to the European Union.

#### Motor vehicles and automotive products

The automotive industry in Turkey, which plays an important role in the
manufacturing sector of the Turkish economy, produced 1,352,648 motor vehicles
in 2022, ranking as the 13th largest producer in the world (production peaked
at 1,695,731 motor vehicles in 2017, when Turkey also ranked 13th). Turkish
automotive companies like TEMSA, Otokar and BMC are among the world's largest
van, bus and truck manufacturers. Togg, or Turkey's Automobile Joint Venture
Group Inc. is the first all-electric vehicle company of Turkey.

The automotive industry is an important part of the economy since the late
1960s. The companies that operate in the sector are mainly located in the
Marmara Region. With a cluster of car-makers and parts suppliers, the Turkish
automotive sector has become an integral part of the global network of
production bases, exporting over $22.94 billion worth of motor vehicles and
components in 2008.

Global car manufacturers with production plants include Fiat/Tofaş, Oyak-
Renault, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Ford/Otosan. Turkish automotive companies
like TEMSA, Otokar and BMC are among the world's largest van, bus and truck
manufacturers.[_citation needed_] Togg is a new Turkish automotive company
established in 2018 for producing EVs. Togg's factory in Gemlik, Bursa
Province, was inaugurated on 29 October 2022, the 99th anniversary of the
Turkish Republic.

Turkey's annual auto exports, including trucks and buses, surpassed 1 million
units for the first time in 2016 as foreign automakers' investment in new
models and a recovery in its mainstay European market lifted shipments.
According to the industry group Automotive Manufacturers Association (OSD),
Turkey-based car plants exported 1.14 million units in 2016, up 15% from the
year before. Auto exports hit a record high for the fourth straight year.
Production grew 9% year on year in 2016 to 1.48 million units, setting a new
record for the second consecutive year. Nearly 80% of vehicles produced in
Turkey were exported.

#### Multiple unit trains, locomotives and wagons

Istanbul Metro's M8 line is among the new lines with fully automated
driverless trains and platform screen doors for increasing passenger safety.

TÜLOMSAŞ (1894), TÜVASAŞ (1951) and EUROTEM (2006) are among the major
producers of multiple unit trains, locomotives and wagons in Turkey, including
high-speed EMU and DMU models.[_citation needed_]

Havelsan are major manufacturers. On 11 July 2002, Turkey became a Level 3
partner of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) development program. TAI builds
various aircraft types and models, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the
Turkish Air Force. Turkey has recently launched domestically built new
military/intelligence satellites including a 0.8m resolution reconnaissance
satellite (Project Göktürk-1) for use by the Turkish Armed Forces and a 2m
resolution reconnaissance satellite (Project Göktürk-2) for use by the Turkish
National Intelligence Organization.[_citation needed_]

### Construction and contracting sector

The Turkish construction and contracting industry is made up of a large number
of businesses. In 2016 a total of 39 Turkish construction and contracting
companies were listed in the Top 250 International Contractors List prepared
by the Engineering News-Record. From the beginning of the 1970s to the end of
2022, Turkish contractors have completed more than 11,605 projects in 133
countries. Their business volume abroad has reached 472 billion US Dollars in
2022.

As Turkey is prone to strong earthquakes, the buildings that were constructed
before the post-1999 safety standards and regulations remain a major concern,
with many ongoing urban redevelopment and reconstruction projects, especially
in large cities. In 2019, an amnesty plan to register illegally constructed
buildings for generating extra tax revenues to the government brought in $3.1
billion, but the plan was criticized for ignoring safety issues. The two major
earthquakes on February 6, 2023 in southern Turkey have revealed that some of
the recently built structures that collapsed were not constructed in
accordance with the latest safety regulations.

### Service sector

#### Banking and finance

The Turkish Central Bank and other state-owned banks such as Ziraat Bank,
VakıfBank and Halkbank have their new headquarters at the Istanbul Financial
Center (IFC) in Ataşehir.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in
Istanbul was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the
headquarters of the Ottoman Bank (established as the _Bank-ı Osmanî_ in 1856,
and later reorganized as the _Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane_ in 1863) and the Ottoman
Stock Exchange (1866) were located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be
Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks
began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of
Levent and Maslak.

Originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange (_Dersaadet Tahvilat
Borsası_) in 1866, and reorganized to its current structure at the beginning
of 1986, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) is the sole securities market of
Turkey. In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange moved to its current building in
the Istinye quarter. The Istanbul Gold Exchange was also established in 1995.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (_Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez
Bankası_) was founded in 1930 as a privileged joint-stock company. The CBRT
possesses the sole right to issue notes. It also has the obligation to provide
for the monetary requirements of the state agricultural and commercial
enterprises.

The "New Turkish lira" (TRY) was introduced on 1 January 2005. On 1 January
2009, the New Turkish lira was renamed once again as the "Turkish lira", with
the introduction of new banknotes and coins.

Banking came under stress beginning in October 2008, as a result of the 2008
financial crisis. Turkish banking authorities warned state-run banks against
the pullback of loans from the larger financial sectors.

Söğütözü business district in Ankara, Turkey's capital and second largest city

Turkey's economy resumed its growth between 2009 and 2013, which was followed
by a period of stagnation and recession between 2014 and 2020. Turkey's GDP
began to recover and grow again in the period between 2020 and 2024.

In 2020, the total value of assets of the banking sector in Turkey amounted to
more than $800 billion. As of January 2021, there were a total of 48 banks
operating with 9,880 branches in Turkey and 71 branches abroad. As of October
2021[update], the foreign currency deposits of the citizens and residents in
Turkish banks stood at $234 billion, equivalent to around half of all
deposits. As of October 2024[update], the foreign currency reserves of the
Turkish Central Bank were $85 billion, its gold reserves were $67.4 billion,
while its official reserve assets stood at $159.8 billion.

#### Transport

Turkish Airlines, flag carrier of Turkey, has been selected by Skytrax as
Europe's best airline for five years in a row (2011–2015). With destinations
in 129 countries worldwide, Turkish Airlines is the largest carrier in the
world by number of countries served as of 2024[update]. Istanbul Airport is
the main international airport serving Istanbul, Turkey. It is a major hub in
the world.

In 2013 there were ninety-eight airports in Turkey, including 22 international
airports. As of 2015[update], Istanbul Atatürk Airport is the 11th busiest
airport in the world, serving 31,833,324 passengers between January and July
2014, according to Airports Council International. The new (third)
international airport of Istanbul is planned to be the largest airport in the
world, with a capacity to serve 150 million passengers per annum.

The 1915 Çanakkale Bridge on the Dardanelles strait, connecting Europe and
Asia, is the longest suspension bridge in the world.

The state-owned utility Turkish State Railways operates the 12,740–km railway
network, 23rd longest in the world. Since 2003, Turkish State Railways has
also been investing in high-speed rail lines, which at 2,175 km (1,353 mi)
ranked ninth longest in the world.

terminal in Ankara

As of 2010, the country had a roadway network of 426,951 km, including 2,080
km of expressways and 16,784 km of divided highways.

As of 2010, the Turkish merchant marine included 1,199 ships (604 registered
at home), ranking 7th in the world. Turkey's coastline has 1,200 km of
navigable waterways.

In 2008, 7,555 kilometres (4,694 mi) of natural gas pipelines and 3,636
kilometres (2,259 mi) of petroleum pipelines spanned the country's territory.

#### Communications

As of 2008, there were 17,502,000 operational landline telephones in Turkey,
which ranked 18th in the world; while there were 65,824,000 registered mobile
phones in the country, which ranked 15th in the world during the same year.
The largest landline telephone operator is Türk Telekom, which also owns
TTNET, the largest internet service provider in Turkey.[_citation needed_] The
largest mobile phone operators in the country are Turkcell, Vodafone Turkey,
Avea and TTNET Mobil.[_citation needed_]

The telecommunications liberalisation process started in 2004 after the
creation of the Telecommunication Authority, and is still ongoing.[_citation
needed_] Private sector companies operate in mobile telephony, long-distance
telephony and Internet access. Additional digital exchanges are permitting a
rapid increase in subscribers;[_citation needed_] the construction of a
network of technologically advanced intercity trunk lines, using both fiber-
optic cable and digital microwave radio relay, is facilitating communication
between urban centres.

The remote areas of the country are reached by a domestic satellite system,
while the number of subscribers to mobile-cellular telephone service is
growing rapidly.

The main line international telephone service is provided by the SEA-ME-WE 3
submarine communications cable and by submarine fiber-optic cables in the
Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea that link Turkey with Italy, Greece, Israel,
Bulgaria, Romania, and Russia. In 2002, there were 12 Intelsat satellite earth
stations; and 328 mobile satellite terminals in the Inmarsat and Eutelsat
systems.

Türksat A.Ş. is the primary communications satellite operator of Turkey,
controlling the Turksat series of satellites. Göktürk-1, Göktürk-2 and
Göktürk-3 are Turkey's earth observation satellites for reconnaissance,
operated by the Turkish Ministry of National Defense. BILSAT-1 and RASAT are
the scientific observation satellites operated by the TÜBİTAK Space
Technologies Research Institute, which (together with Turkish Aerospace
Industries and Aselsan) also takes part in the production of Turkey's
satellites.[_citation needed_]

As of 2001, there were 16 AM, 107 FM, and 6 shortwave radio stations in the
country.[_needs update_]

As of 2015, there were 42,275,017 internet users in Turkey, which ranked 15th
in the world; while as of 2012, there were 7,093,000 internet hosts in the
country, which ranked 16th in the world.

#### Tourism

In 2023, Turkey was the fifth most visited destination in the world, with 55.2
million foreign tourists visiting the country. In 2019, Turkey ranked sixth in
the world in terms of the number of international tourist arrivals, with 51.2
million foreign visitors.

Over the years, Turkey has emerged as a popular tourist destination for many
Europeans, competing with other Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Italy
and Spain. Resorts in provinces such as Antalya and Muğla (which are located
on the Turkish Riviera) have become very popular among tourists.

#### Medical tourism

Başakşehir Çam and Sakura City Hospital in Istanbul

There are numerous private hospitals in Turkey, which has benefited from
medical tourism in recent years. Health tourism generated revenues worth $1
billion in 2019 for Turkey's economy. A total of 662,087 patients were treated
at Turkish hospitals in 2019 within the scope of health tourism, with around
60% of the income being obtained from plastic surgeries.

## Largest companies

In 2024, ten publicly traded Turkish companies were listed in the Forbes
Global 2000 list – an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the
world by Forbes magazine. The banking industry leads with four companies in
the list followed by the airline, automotive and retailer with one company
each. There are also three conglomerates. As of 2024, the listed public
companies were:

## External trade and investment

As of 2016, the main trading partners of Turkey are the European Union,
Russia, the United Kingdom, the UAE, Iraq, and China, many being top in both
export as well as import. Turkey has taken advantage of a customs union with
the EU, signed in 1995, to increase industrial production for exports, while
benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country. In addition to
the European-Turkish Customs Union, the Turkish government has signed free-
trade agreements with 22 countries.

A very large aspect of Turkey trade revolves around the automotive industry,
where its top exports are cars, accounting for $13.2 billion. Other top
exports from the country are gold, delivery trucks, vehicle parts and jewelry,
which are respectively, $6.96 billion, $5.04 billion, $4.64 billion, and $3.39
billion. These values are calculated using the 1992 revision of the Harmonized
System classification. Comparatively, it imports many of the same industries,
such as, gold valued at $17.1 billion, refined petroleum at $9.8 billion, cars
at $8.78 billion, vehicle parts at $6.34 billion and scrap iron at $5.84
billion.

The construction and contracting companies, such as Enka, Rönesans Holding and
Tekfen, have been significant players in the country's economy.

Without a carbon price exporters to the European Union will have to pay the EU
Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism from 2026, and in 2024 they started hedging
against this by buying EU Allowances.

Turkey had many improvements in the ease of doing business index. Its rank
increased from 68th in 2017 to 33rd in 2020. As of 2021, it was performing
better than countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.[_vague_]

## Natural resources

### Energy

According to some studies a coal-phase out in favour of renewable energy would
increase employment.

Turkey's energy trade deficit was over $US80 billion in 2022, causing a large
foreign trade deficit. Europe supports energy efficiency and renewable energy
via the €1 billion Mid-size Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MidSEFF) to
finance investments in these areas. Energy subsidies amounted to 200 billion
lira in 2021. Up to 150kWh per month of free electricity is provided to two
million poor families.

Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency said in 2019 that,
because of its falling price, the focus should be on maximizing onshore wind
power in Turkey. The economics of coal power has been modelled by Carbon
Tracker. They estimate that for _new_ plants both wind and solar is already
cheaper than coal power. And they forecast that _existing_ coal plants will be
more expensive than _new_ solar by 2023 and _new_ wind by 2027.

Most energy deals in 2019 were for renewables, and over half the investment in
these was from outside the country. The external costs of fossil fuel
consumption in 2018 has been estimated as 1.5% of GDP. The government sets the
price of residential gas and electricity, and as of 2018[update], for
residential consumers, "high cost is the most important problem of Turkey's
energy system".

In 2022, the energy import bill was 97 billion USD. Keeping consumer prices
low is a political priority. In 2024 Shura estimated the costs of moving to
clean energy at about half the benefits, which are mostly due to reduced air
pollution and carbon emissions.

#### Renewable energy

Renewables supply a quarter of energy in Turkey, including heat and
electricity. Some houses have rooftop solar water heating, and hot water from
underground warms many spas and greenhouses. In parts of the west hot rocks
are shallow enough to generate electricity as well as heat. Wind turbines,
also mainly near western cities and industry, generate a tenth of Turkey’s
electricity. Hydropower, mostly from dams in the east, is the only modern
renewable energy which is fully exploited. Hydropower averages about a fifth
of the country's electricity, but much less in drought years. Apart from wind
and hydro, other renewables; such as geothermal, solar and biogas; together
generated almost a tenth of Turkey’s electricity in 2022. Over half the
installed capacity for electricity generation is renewables.

Turkey has a long history of wood burning, windmills, and bathing in hot
springs. Many dams were built from the mid-20th to early 21st century, but
some say that governments have not allowed civil society enough influence on
energy policy, leading to protests against building dams, geothermal power
plants, and at least one wind farm. Despite Turkey’s sunny climate solar power
is underdeveloped. As the electricity system is already flexible increasing to
70% renewables is easily feasible.Solar power could be expanded more quickly
if the electricity grid was improved faster and energy policy revised,
especially by abolishing fossil fuel subsidies.

Many hybrid power plants are planned, and batteries are being integrated.
Companies with a lot of renewables include the state electricity generation
company (mainly hydro), Aydem, and Kalyon. If renewables could help phase-out
coal by 2030, instead of by the national net zero greenhouse gas emissions
target year of 2053, that would have significant health benefits and reduce
inflation in Turkey. As of 2022 renewables are not sufficient to meet that
target year. Various electric vehicles are being manufactured, which will use
some of the increased renewable generation and help reduce air pollution.

#### Fossil fuels

##### Gas

The _Kanuni_ has drilled in the Black Sea.

Natural gas supplies over a quarter of Turkey's energy. The country consumes
50 to 60 billion cubic metres of this natural gas each year, nearly all of
which is imported. A large gas field in the Black Sea started production in
2023.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began, several European countries
stopped buying Russian oil or gas, but Turkey's relations with Russia are good
enough that it continues to buy both. Turkey receives almost half of its gas
from Russia. As of 2023[update] wholesale gas is expensive and a large part of
the import bill.

Households buy the most gas, followed by industry and power stations. Over 80%
of the population has access to gas, and it supplies half the country's
heating requirements. As the state owned oil and gas wholesaler BOTAŞ has 80%
of the gas market, the government can and does subsidize residential and
industrial gas consumers. All industrial and commercial customers, and
households using more than a certain amount of gas, can switch suppliers.

##### Oil

Tankers, like this one in the Bosporus, are one way to export oil from Central
Asia.

Oil supplies over a quarter of Turkey's energy. Because the country produces
very little oil, it is almost completely dependent on imports of oil and oil
products such as petrol and diesel, over half of which is consumed in the
country's road vehicles. Turkey is the world's largest user of liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) for road transport.

Because Turkey produces only 7% of the oil it consumes, the country's total
imports are worth more than its exports, which is a problem for its economy.
After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began, several European countries
stopped buying Russian oil, petrol and diesel but Turkey's relations with
Russia are such that it supplies most such imports.

##### Coal

Government-owned Turkish Coal Operations Authority mine in Yeniköy, Milas

Coal supplies a quarter of Turkey's primary energy, and the country is one of
the largest consumers in the world. The heavily subsidised coal industry
generates over a third of the country's electricity and emits a third of
Turkey's greenhouse gases.

Coal is a major contributor to air pollution, and damages health across the
nation, being burnt even in homes and cities. Most coal is burnt in power
stations, and it is estimated that a phase out of coal power in Turkey by 2030
instead of by the 2050s would save over 100 thousand lives. Flue gas emission
limits are in place, but data from mandatory reporting is not made public.

Over 90% of coal mined in Turkey is lignite (brown coal), which is more
polluting than other types of coal. Turkey's energy policy encourages mining
lignite for coal-fired power stations in order to reduce gas imports; and coal
supplies over 40% of domestic energy production. Coal burning peaked in 2018,
and mining in 2022 at about 100 million tonnes. Most coal is imported, as in
contrast to local lignite production, Turkey imports most of its bituminous
coal from Russia. The largest coalfield in Turkey is Elbistan. Turkey is
bidding to host the 2026 United Nations Climate Change Conference, in which
getting agreement on coal phase-out will be very important.

### Minerals

Marble quarries in Turkey.

In 2019, the country was the world's 2nd largest producer of chromium; the
largest producer of boron; 6th largest producer of antimony; 9th largest
producer of lead; 13th largest producer of iron ore; 11th largest producer of
molybdenum; 4th largest producer of gypsum; 15th largest producer of graphite;
in addition to being the 11th largest producer of salt.

As a gold producer Turkey is currently ranked 22nd globally. Hosting some of
the largest gold deposits in the European continent it is currently Europe's
largest gold producer, producing 42 tonnes of gold in 2020. World class
deposits include Kisladag Mine 17Moz and Copler 10Moz.[_citation needed_]

## Environment

Almost all post-covid stimulus was detrimental to the environment, with Russia
being the only worse country. In the 21st century, Turkey's fossil fuel
subsidies are around 0.2% of GDP, including at least US$14 billion (US$169 per
person) between January 2020 and September 2021. Data on finance for fossil
fuels by state-owned banks and export credit agencies is not public.

As of 2023 fossil gas is subsidized more than electricity - equalizing the
subsidies would benefit the environment.

## Employment

| This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. _( November
2021)_  
---|---  
  
The minimum wage in Turkey is ₺ 22,104 (US$ 630.36) as of January 1, 2025.

TurkStat estimated unemployment at 9.4% in 2023. The province with the highest
unemployment rate was Hakkari at 23.3% and the province with the lowest
unemployment rate was Sinop at 4.8%.

In 2021 trade unions complained that according to TurkStat data the
unemployment rate was falling, whereas the data provided by the government's
Employment Agency (İŞKUR) showed that it was rising.[_needs update?_]
Environmentalists argue that some actions to improve the environment would
also benefit the economy. For example, investing in wind power in Turkey and
solar power in Turkey would create jobs and is competitive with fossil fuels.

## Poverty

Turkey made steady progress in reducing poverty from the early 2000s to the
mid-2010s.[_vague_] In 2022, social security expenditure stood at 12.4% of GDP
according to OECD data.

## Regional disparities

According to Eurostat data, Turkish GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing
power standards stood at 64 percent of the EU average in 2018. Istanbul has
the largest GDP, while Kocaeli comes first in GDP per capita.

The country's wealth is mainly concentrated in the northwest and west, while
the east and southeast suffer from poverty, lower economic production and
higher levels of unemployment. However, in line with the rapid growth of
Turkey's GDP during the first two decades of the 21st century (with brief
periods of stagnation and recession), parts of Anatolia began reaching a
higher economic standard. These cities are known as the Anatolian Tigers.
