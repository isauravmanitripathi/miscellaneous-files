The **economy of Belize** is a small, essentially private enterprise economy
that is based primarily on agriculture, tourism, and services. The cultivation
of newly discovered oil in the town of Spanish Lookout has presented new
prospects and problems for this developing nation. Belize's primary exports
are citrus, sugar, and bananas. Belize's trade deficit has been growing,
mostly as a result of low export prices for sugar and bananas.[_citation

The new government faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid
action to improve tax collection has been promised, but a lack of progress in
reining in spending could bring the exchange rate under pressure. The Belize
dollar is fixed to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 2:1.

The domestic industry is limited, constrained by relatively high-cost labour
and energy and a small domestic market. Tourism attracts the most foreign
direct investment although significant foreign investment is also found in the
energy, telecommunications, and agricultural sectors.

Belize is considered a tax haven.

## History

Belize's economy depended on forestry until well into the 20th century.
Logwood, used to make dye, was Belize's initial main export. However, the
supply outstripped the demand, especially as Europeans developed man-made dyes
which were less expensive. Loggers turned to mahogany, which grew in abundance
in the country's forests. The wood was prized for use in cabinets, ships, and
railroad carriers.

While many merchants and traders became wealthy from the mahogany industry,
ups and downs in the market had a large impact on the economy. In addition,
new mahogany trees weren't being planted because mahogany trees grow slowly;
the rate of natural regrowth necessitated a large, long-term investment in
tree farming, which was not made. As the 19th century progressed, loggers were
forced to go deeper into the forests to find the trees, increasing labour
costs.

Variations in mahogany exports over long periods of time were linked to the
accessible supply of the resource. Thus, improvements in hauling methods
helped the cutters satisfy increasing demands for mahogany by enabling them to
extract timber from areas in the interior that had been previously
inaccessible to them. Immediately after the introduction of cattle in the
early 19th century, tractors in the 1920s, and lorries in the 1940s,
production levels rose dramatically.

When the supply of accessible timber dwindled and logging became too
unprofitable in the 20th century, the country's economy shifted to new
sectors. Cane sugar became the principal export and recently has been
augmented by expanded production of citrus, bananas, seafood, and apparel. The
country has about 8,090 km2 of arable land, only a small fraction of which is
under cultivation. To curb land speculation, the government enacted
legislation in 1973 that requires non-Belizeans to complete a development plan
on land they purchase before obtaining title to plots of more than 10 acres
(40,000 m2) of rural land or more than one-half acre (2,000 m2) of urban land.

## Economic sectors

### Agriculture

Banana production accounted for 16 percent of total Belizean exports in 1999.

Citrus fruits are Belize's second most important agricultural crop.

In 2018, Belize produced 1.7 million tons of sugarcane, being heavily
dependent on this product. In addition to sugarcane, the country produced 100
thousand tons of orange, 80 thousand tons of banana, 77 thousand tons of
maize, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products such
as papaya, rice and soy.

### Energy

Agriculture is a key part of the economy

A major constraint on a functioning market economy in Belize continues to be
the scarcity of infrastructure investments. Although electricity, telephone,
and water utilities are all relatively good, Belize has the most expensive
electricity in the region. Several capital projects are currently underway.
The largest of these is a $15 million rural electrification program to be
jointly implemented by the government and Belize Electricity Limited (BEL).

### Transport

Ports in Belize City, Dangriga, and Big Creek handle regularly scheduled
shipping from the U.S. and the United Kingdom although draft is limited to a
maximum of 10 feet in Belize City and 15 feet in southern ports. International
air service is provided by WestJet, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United
Airlines and TACA to/from gateways in Toronto, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta,
Charlotte, North Carolina, Miami, and San Salvador.

### Tourism

A combination of factors—climate, the Belize Barrier Reef (longest in the
Western Hemisphere), 127 offshore Cayes (islands), excellent fishing, safe
waters for boating, scuba diving, and snorkeling, abundant jungle flora and
fauna, and numerous Mayan ruins—support the thriving tourism and ecotourism
industry. Development costs are high, but the Government of Belize has
designated tourism as its second development priority after agriculture.

In 2011, tourist arrivals totaled 888,191 (mostly from the U.S.) and tourist
receipts amounted to $260 million. The travel and tourism industry in 2011
directly contributed 350.6 million BZD (176 million USD) to Belize's GDP
(12.0% of GDP). This primarily reflects the economic activity directly
generated by industries supported by tourists, such as hotels, restaurants,
leisure industries, travel agents, airlines and other transportation services.
The total contribution to GDP in 2011 (including wider effects from
investment, the supply chain, and induced income impacts) was 971.9 million
BZD (486 million USD) (33.2% of GDP). Travel and tourism directly generated
14,500 jobs in 2011 (10.9% of total employment) and, including indirect and
induced effects, supported 40,000 jobs (30.1% of total employment).

## Trade

Belize's economic performance is highly susceptible to external market
changes. Although moderate growth has been achieved in recent years, the
achievements are vulnerable to world commodity price fluctuations and
continuation of preferential trading agreements, especially with the U.S.
(cane sugar) and UK (bananas).

Belize continues to rely heavily on foreign trade with the United States as
its number one trading partner. Total imports in 2000 totaled $446 million
while total exports were only $349.9 million. In 2000, the U.S. accounted for
48.5% of Belize's total exports and provided 49.7% of all Belizean imports.
Other major trading partners include the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states. Belize established a preferential
trade agreement with Guatemala in 2010.

Belize aims to stimulate the growth of commercial agriculture through CARICOM.
Belizean trade with the rest of the Caribbean is small compared to that with
the United States and Europe. Belize is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin
Initiative (CBI), a U.S. Government program to stimulate investment in
Caribbean nations by providing duty-free access to the U.S. market for most
Caribbean products.

Significant U.S. private investments in citrus and shrimp farms have been made
in Belize under CBI. U.S. trade preferences allowing for duty-free re-import
of finished apparel cut from U.S. textiles have significantly expanded the
apparel industry. EU and UK preferences also have been vital for the expansion
and prosperity of the sugar and banana industries.

## Belize International Business Companies

In 1990, Belize enacted the International Business Companies Act based on the
British Virgin Islands model. In ten years, Belize has registered more than
15,000 IBCs. A Belizean IBC is a corporate vehicle for international financial
transactions and allows the investor to engage in activities including asset
protection, operating bank accounts, brokerage accounts, ship ownership, and
commission arrangements.

The IBC legislation was supplemented in 1992 with the enactment of a Trusts
Act which provides for both onshore and offshore trusts.

Belize IBCs have the following features.

**Progressive legislation**

  * The IBC Act was introduced in 1990 to implement competitive offshore legislation for Belize IBCs which was subsequently amended to reflect the changes required to provide efficient Belize offshore services.

**Efficient incorporation/registration**

  * Belize incorporation is very efficient under normal circumstances, a Belize IBC can be incorporated in a couple of working days.

**Flexibility in company structure**

  * There is no requirement for a secretary, resident or otherwise
  * Only one director or shareholder required for the company formation
  * Shareholder(s) and director(s) may be the same person
  * The shareholder(s) and director(s) can be a natural person or a corporate body
  * There is no requirement for appointing local shareholder(s) and director(s)

**Privacy of identity of principals**

  * The documents for Belize offshore Incorporation do not carry the name or identity of any shareholder or director. The names or identities of these persons do not appear in any public record.

**Taxation in Belize**

  * According to the IBC Act of 1990, offshore companies are exempted from all taxes.
