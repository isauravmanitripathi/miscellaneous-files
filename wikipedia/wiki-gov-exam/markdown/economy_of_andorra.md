The **economy of Andorra** is a developed and free market economy driven by
finance, retail, and tourism. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) was
US$6.00 billion in 2024. Attractive for shoppers from France and Spain as a
free port, Andorra also has developed active summer and winter tourist
resorts. With some 270 hotels and 400 restaurants, as well as many shops, the
tourist trade employs a growing portion of the domestic labour force. An
estimated 10 million tourists visit annually.

There is a fairly active trade in consumer goods, including imported
manufactured items, which, because they are duty-free, are less expensive in
Andorra than in neighboring countries. Andorra's duty-free status also has had
a significant effect on the controversy concerning its relationship with the
European Union (EU). Its negotiations on duty-free status and relationship
with the EU began in 1987, soon after Spain joined. An agreement that went
into effect in July 1991 sets duty-free quotas and places limits on certain
items â€“ mainly milk products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.
Andorra is permitted to maintain price differences from other EU countries,
and visitors enjoy limited duty-free allowances.

The results of Andorra's elections thus far indicate that many support the
government's reform initiatives and believe the country must, to some degree,
integrate into the European Union in order to continue to enjoy its
prosperity. Although arable land comprises less than 2% of the country,
agriculture was the mainstay of the Andorran economy until the upsurge in
tourism. Sheep raising has been the principal agricultural activity, but
tobacco growing is lucrative. Most of Andorra's food is imported.

In addition to handicrafts, manufacturing includes cigars, cigarettes and
furniture for domestic and export markets. A hydroelectric plant at Les
Escaldes, with a capacity of 26.5 megawatts, provides 40% of Andorra's
electricity; Spain provides the rest.

## Overview

Tourism is the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounting for roughly 80% of
GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's
duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain
have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower
tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes
substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars
and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as
an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs).
