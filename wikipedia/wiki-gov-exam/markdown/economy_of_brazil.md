The **economy of Brazil** is the largest in Latin America and the Southern
Hemisphere in nominal terms. As of 2024, the Brazilian economy is the third
largest in the Americas in nominal terms, and second largest in purchasing
power parity. It is an upper-middle income developing economy. In 2024,
according to International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil had the 10th largest
nominal gross domestic product in the world, but the 7th largest purchasing
power parity GDP in the world. In 2024, according to _Forbes_ , Brazil was the
7th largest country in the world by number of billionaires. Brazil is one of
the ten chief industrial states in the world according to International Labour
Organization. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brazil's
nominal GDP was US$2.331 trillion; the country has a long history of being
among the largest economies in the world and the GDP per capita was US$11,178
per inhabitant.

The country is rich in natural resources. From 2000 to 2012, Brazil was one of
the fastest-growing major economies in the world, with an average annual GDP
growth rate of over 5%. Its GDP surpassed that of the United Kingdom in 2012,
temporarily making Brazil the world's sixth-largest economy. However, Brazil's
economic growth decelerated in 2013 and the country entered a recession in
2014. The economy started to recover in 2017, with a 1% growth in the first
quarter, followed by a 0.3% growth in the second quarter compared to the same
period of the previous year. It officially exited the recession.

According to the World Economic Forum, Brazil was the top country in upward
evolution of competitiveness in 2009, gaining eight positions among other
countries, overcoming Russia for the first time, and partially closing the
competitiveness gap with India and China among the BRICS economies. Important
steps taken since the 1990s toward fiscal sustainability, as well as measures
taken to liberalize and open the economy, have significantly boosted the
country's competitiveness fundamentals, providing a better environment for
private-sector development.

Brazil is a member of diverse economic organizations, such as Mercosur,
Prosur, G8+5, G20, WTO, Paris Club, Cairns Group, and is advanced to be a
permanent member of the OECD.

From a colony focused on primary sector goods (sugar, gold and cotton), Brazil
managed to create a diversified industrial base during the 20th century. The
steel industry is a prime example of that, with Brazil being the 9th largest
steel producer in 2018, and the 5th largest steel net exporter in 2018. Gerdau
is the largest producer of long steel in the Americas, and Vale is the largest
producer of iron ore in the world. Petrobras, the Brazilian oil and gas
company, is the most valuable company in Latin America.

## History

When the Portuguese explorers arrived in the 16th century, the native tribes
of current-day Brazil totaled about 2.5 million people and had lived virtually
unchanged since the Stone Age. From Portugal's colonization of Brazil
(1500–1822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the
production of primary products for exports.

In the Portuguese Empire, Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial
mercantile policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles
– sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of
Brazil was heavily dependent on African slave labor until the late 19th
century (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period
Brazil was also the colony with the largest number of European settlers, most
of them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see
Dutch Brazil), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish
and Sephardic Jews.

Subsequently, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic
growth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe, mainly from Portugal
(including the Azores and Madeira), Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, Ukraine,
Switzerland, Austria and Russia. Smaller numbers of immigrants also came from
the Netherlands, France, Finland, Iceland and the Scandinavian countries,
Lithuania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, England, Ireland,
Scotland, Croatia, Czech Republic, Malta, North Macedonia and Luxembourg, the
Middle East (mainly from Lebanon, Syria and Armenia), Japan, the United States
and South Africa, until the 1930s. In fact, international mass immigration to
Brazil during the 19th century had positive effects on the country's human
capital development. Immigrants usually exhibited better formal and informal
training than native Brazilians and tended to have more entrepreneurial
spirit. Their arrival was beneficial for the region, not only because of the
skills and knowledge they brought to the country themselves, but also because
of spillover effects of their human capital to the native Brazilian
population. Human capital spillover effects were strongest in regions with the
highest numbers of immigrants, and the positive effects are still observable
today, in some regions.

In 2007, with a population of over 190 million and abundant natural resources,
Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of
millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5 million television
sets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70 million cubic meters
of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane
gas, and a wide range of hundreds of petrochemicals.

Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads, more than 150 gigawatts
of installed electric power capacity and its real per capita GDP surpassed
US$9,800 in 2017. Its industrial sector accounts for three-fifths of the South
American economy's industrial production. The country's scientific and
technological development is argued to be attractive to foreign direct
investment, in 2019, Brazil occupied the 4th largest destination for foreign
investments, behind only the United States, China and Singapore.

The agricultural sector, locally called the _agronegócio_ (agro-business), has
also been dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil among the most
highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector. The
agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which
allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown. Due to
a downturn in Western economies, Brazil found itself in 2010 trying to halt
the appreciation of the real.

One of the most important corruption cases in Brazil concerns the company
Odebrecht. Since the 1980s, Odebrecht has spent several billion dollars in the
form of bribes to bribe parliamentarians to vote in favour of the group. At
the municipal level, Odebrecht's corruption was aimed at "stimulating
privatisations", particularly in water and sewer management.

## Components

The service sector is the largest component of the gross domestic product
(GDP) at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent.
Agriculture represents 5.5 percent of GDP (2011). The Brazilian labor force is
estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19
percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.

### Agricultural sector

Agriculture production  Main products  | Coffee, soybeans, wheat, rice, corn, sugarcane, cocoa, citrus; beef   
---|---  
Labor force  | 15.7% of total labor force   
GDP of sector  | 5.9% of total GDP   
Combine harvester on a plantation Economic activity in Brazil (1977).

Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee, orange,
guaraná, açaí and Brazil nut; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, papaya,
tobacco, pineapple, banana, cotton, beans, coconut, watermelon and lemon; is
one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, avocado, tangerine,
persimmon, mango, guava, rice, sorghum and tomato; and is one of the top 15
world producers of grape, apple, melon, peanut, fig, peach, onion, palm oil
and natural rubber.

In the production of animal proteins, Brazil is today one of the largest
countries in the world. In 2019, the country was the world's largest exporter
of chicken meat. It was also the second largest producer of beef, the world's
third largest producer of milk, the world's fourth largest producer of pork
and the seventh largest producer of eggs in the world.

Agribusiness contributes to Brazil's trade balance, in spite of trade barriers
and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.

In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew
from 51 million to approximately 187 million inhabitants, an increase of over
2 percent per year. Brazil created and expanded a complex agribusiness sector.
However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the
Amazon.

The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the
agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific subsidy
program geared towards family agriculture Programa de Fortalecimento da
Agricultura Familiar (Pronaf), which guarantees financing for equipment and
cultivation and encourages the use of new technology. With regards to family
agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit,
research and extension programs. A special line of credit is available for
women and young farmers.

Brazil is the world's largest exporter of chicken meat. Farm in Southern
Brazil.

With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to
provide suitable living and working conditions for families who live in areas
allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating jobs. Through
partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government
is working towards guaranteeing infrastructure for the settlements, following
the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land
represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land
reform program.

Over 600,000 km2 of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of
rural property; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the
Central-western region (savannah), the northern region (area of transition)
and parts of the northeastern region (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain
crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50
million tonnes.

In the cattle-raising sector, the "green ox," which is raised in pastures, on
a diet of hay and mineral salts, conquered markets in Asia, Europe and the
Americas, particularly after the "mad cow disease" scare period. Brazil has
the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads, responsible for
exports of more than US$1 billion/year.

A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber cellulose,
Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in
which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it
answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is
the world leader in soybean exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the
planet's orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for
beef and chicken.

### Mining

Gold production in the area of Pantanal.

In the mining sector, Brazil stands out in the extraction of iron ore (where
it is the world's second largest exporter), copper, gold, bauxite (one of the
5 largest producers in the world), manganese (one of the 5 largest producers
in the world), tin (one of the largest producers in the world), niobium
(concentrates 98% of reserves known to the world) and nickel. In terms of
gemstones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate
and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and
opal.

In 2019, Brazil's figures were as follows: it was the world's largest producer
of niobium (88.9 thousand tons); the 2nd largest world producer of tantalum
(430 tons); the 2nd largest world producer of iron ore (405 million tons); the
4th largest world producer of manganese (1.74 million tons); the 4th largest
world producer of bauxite (34 million tons); the 4th largest world producer of
vanadium (5.94 thousand tons); the 5th largest world producer of lithium (2.4
thousand tons); the 6th largest world producer of tin (14 thousand tons); the
8th largest world producer of nickel (60.6 thousand tons); the 8th largest
world producer of phosphate (4.7 million tons); the 12th largest world
producer of gold (90 tons); the 14th largest world producer of copper (360
thousand tons); the 14th largest world producer of titanium (25 thousand
tons); the 13th largest world producer of gypsum (3 million tons); the 3rd
largest world producer of graphite (96 thousand tons); the 21st largest world
producer of sulfur (500 thousand tons); the 9th largest world producer of salt
(7.4 million tons); besides having had a chromium production of 200 thousand
tons.

Brazil has the second-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting
for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel and
petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and consumer durables. With increased
economic stability provided by the Plano Real, Brazilian and multinational
businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large
proportion of which has been purchased from U.S. firms.

The World Bank lists the main producing countries each year, based on the
total production value. According to the 2019 list, Brazil has the 13th most
valuable industry in the world (US$173.6 billion). In the Americas, it is
second only to the United States (2nd place) and Mexico (12th place). In the
food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed
foods in the world. In 2016, the country was the 2nd largest producer of pulp
in the world and the 8th producer of paper. In the footwear industry, in 2019,
Brazil ranked 4th among world producers. In 2019, the country was the 8th
producer of vehicles and the 9th producer of steel in the world. In 2018, the
chemical industry of Brazil was the 8th in the world. In textile industry,
Brazil, although it was among the 5 largest world producers in 2013, is very
little integrated in world trade. In the aviation sector, Brazil has Embraer,
the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, behind Boeing and
Airbus.

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the
early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the
GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services
industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is
attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On 8 May
2008, the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the São Paulo-based Brazilian
Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&F) merged, creating BM&F Bovespa, one of
the largest stock exchanges in the world. Also, the previously monopolistic
reinsurance sector is being opened up to third-party companies. As of[update]
31 December 2007, there were an estimated 21,304,000 broadband lines in
Brazil. Over 75 percent of the broadband lines were via DSL and 10 percent via
cable modems. Proven mineral resources are extensive. Large iron and manganese
reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export
earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium,
copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-
quality coking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.

In the last years, the defence industry in Brazil achieved prominence with
exports of more than US$1 billion per year and sales abroad of high-technology
products like the transport jet Embraer C-390 Millennium, the Embraer EMB 314
Super Tucano, a light attack aircraft, the 6×6 armoured personnel carrier
VBTP-MR Guarani and others armaments like pistols and rifles by the company
Taurus Armas. Embraer is one the world's top 100 defense contractors.

### Creative Industries

The first study into the impact of the Creative Industries on the Brazilian
economy was published by FIRJAN. The creative economy in Latin America was
termed the "Orange Economy" in a publication released by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). This 2013 study valued Brazil's Orange Economy at
US$66.87 billion providing 5,280,000 jobs and responsible for US$9.414 million
in exports, with the value of creative exports being higher than the US$8.016
million value of coffee exports over the same period.

A 2021 study into the Intellectual Property Intensive Sectors in the Brazilian
Economy was undertaken as part of the National Strategy on Intellectual
Property 2021–2030. The study found that 450 of the 673 economic classes could
be classified as IP-intensive sectors that collectively employed 19.3 million
people. The share of GDP between 2014 and 2016 across these economic classes
amounted to R$2.1 trillion _reais_ or 44.2% of GDP over this time.

### Tourism

In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most
visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion
dollars). Tourism in South America as a whole is still underdeveloped: in
Europe, for example, countries obtain annual tourism figures like $73.7
billion (Spain), receiving 82.7 million tourists or 67.3 billion (France),
receiving 89.4 million tourists. While Europe received 710 million tourists in
2018, Asia 347 million and North America 142.2 million, South America received
only 37 million, Central America 10.8 million and the Caribbean 25.7 million.

### Largest companies

São Paulo is the largest financial center in the country and one of the
largest in the world.

In 2017, 20 Brazilian companies were listed in the Forbes Global 2000 list –
an annual ranking of the top 2000 public companies in the world by Forbes
magazine based on a combination of sales, assets, profit, and market value.
The 20 companies listed were:

### Energy

Wind power in Parnaíba. Pirapora Solar Complex, the largest in Brazil and
Latin America, with a capacity of 321 MW.

The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce
dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than
70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in
2006–2007. Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with
2.8 million barrels / day. Production manages to supply the country's demand.
In the beginning of 2020, in the production of oil and natural gas, the
country exceeded 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, for the first
time. In January this year, 3.168 million barrels of oil per day and 138.753
million cubic meters of natural gas were extracted.

Itaipu Dam in Paraná.

Brazil is one of the main world producers of hydroelectric power. In 2019,
Brazil had 217 hydroelectric plants in operation, with an installed capacity
of 98,581 MW, 60.16% of the country's energy generation. In the total
generation of electricity, in 2019 Brazil reached 170,000 megawatts of
installed capacity, more than 75% from renewable sources (the majority,
hydroelectric).

Angra Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro

In 2013, the Southeast Region used about 50% of the load of the National
Integrated System (SIN), being the main energy consuming region in the
country. The region's installed electricity generation capacity totaled almost
42,500 MW, which represented about a third of Brazil's generation capacity.
The hydroelectric generation represented 58% of the region's installed
capacity, with the remaining 42% corresponding basically to the thermoelectric
generation. São Paulo accounted for 40% of this capacity; Minas Gerais by
about 25%; Rio de Janeiro by 13.3%; and Espírito Santo accounted for the rest.
The South Region owns the Itaipu Dam, which was the largest hydroelectric
plant in the world for several years, until the inauguration of Three Gorges
Dam in China. It remains the second largest operating hydroelectric in the
world. Brazil is the co-owner of the Itaipu Plant with Paraguay: the dam is
located on the Paraná River, located on the border between countries. It has
an installed generation capacity of 14 GW for 20 generating units of 700 MW
each. North Region has large hydroelectric plants, such as Belo Monte Dam and
Tucuruí Dam, which produce much of the national energy. Brazil's hydroelectric
potential has not yet been fully exploited, so the country still has the
capacity to build several renewable energy plants in its territory.

Oil platform P-51 of Petrobras.

As of July 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of wind power
was 22 GW, with average capacity factor of 58%. While the world average wind
production capacity factors is 24.7%, there are areas in Northern Brazil,
specially in Bahia State, where some wind farms record with average capacity
factors over 60%; the average capacity factor in the Northeast Region is 45%
in the coast and 49% in the interior. In 2019, wind energy represented 9% of
the energy generated in the country. In 2019, it was estimated that the
country had an estimated wind power generation potential of around 522 GW
(this, only onshore), enough energy to meet three times the country's current
demand. In 2021 Brazil was the 7th country in the world in terms of installed
wind power (21 GW), and the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world
(72 TWh), behind only China, USA and Germany.

Nuclear energy accounts for about 4% of Brazil's electricity. The nuclear
power generation monopoly is owned by Eletronuclear (Eletrobrás Eletronuclear
S/A), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eletrobrás. Nuclear energy is produced by
two reactors at Angra. It is located at the Central Nuclear Almirante Álvaro
Alberto (CNAAA) on the Praia de Itaorna in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro. It
consists of two pressurized water reactors, Angra I, with capacity of 657 MW,
connected to the power grid in 1982, and Angra II, with capacity of 1,350 MW,
connected in 2000. A third reactor, Angra III, with a projected output of
1,350 MW, is planned to be finished.

As of October 2022,[ref] according to ONS, total installed capacity of
photovoltaic solar was 21 GW, with average capacity factor of 23%. Some of the
most irradiated Brazilian States are MG ("Minas Gerais"), BA ("Bahia") and GO
(Goiás), which have indeed world irradiation level records. In 2019, solar
power represented 1,27% of the energy generated in the country. In 2021,
Brazil was the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13
GW), and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).

In 2020, Brazil was also the 2nd largest country in the world in the
production of energy through biomass (energy production from solid biofuels
and renewable waste), with 15,2 GW installed.

### Transport

Rio–Niterói Bridge. The São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport is connected
with the São Paulo Metro. Port of Santos, one of the 40 largest and busiest
ports in the world.

Transport in Brazil is basically carried out using the road mode, the most
developed in the region. There is also a considerable infrastructure of ports
and airports. The railway and fluvial sector, although it has potential, is
usually treated in a secondary way.

Brazil has more than 1.7 million km of roads, of which 215,000 km are paved,
and about 17,000 km are divided highways. The two most important highways in
the country are BR-101 and BR-116. Due to the Andes Mountains, Amazon River
and Amazon Forest, there have always been difficulties in implementing
transcontinental or bioceanic highways. Practically the only route that
existed was the one that connected Brazil to Buenos Aires, in Argentina and
later to Santiago, in Chile. However, in recent years, with the combined
effort of South American countries, new routes have started to emerge, such as
Brazil-Peru (Interoceanic Highway), and a new highway between Brazil,
Paraguay, northern Argentina and northern Chile (Bioceanic Corridor).

There are more than 2,000 airports in Brazil. The country has the second
largest number of airports in the world, behind only the United States. São
Paulo International Airport, located in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo,
is the largest and busiest in the country – the airport connects São Paulo to
practically all major cities around the world. Brazil has 44 international
airports, such as those in Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Porto
Alegre, Florianópolis, Cuiabá, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Belém and Manaus,
among others. The 10 busiest airports in South America in 2017 were: São
Paulo-Guarulhos (Brazil), Bogotá (Colombia), São Paulo-Congonhas (Brazil),
Santiago (Chile), Lima (Peru), Brasília (Brazil), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),
Buenos Aires-Aeroparque (Argentina), Buenos Aires-Ezeiza (Argentina), and
Minas Gerais (Brazil).

About ports, Brazil has some of the busiest ports in South America, such as
Port of Santos, Port of Rio de Janeiro, Port of Paranaguá, Port of Itajaí,
Port of Rio Grande, Port of São Francisco do Sul and Suape Port. The 15
busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de
Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires
(Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itajaí (Brazil),
Valparaíso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranaguá (Brazil), Rio Grande
(Brazil), São Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).

The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It
is basically used for transporting ores.

Among the main Brazilian waterways, two stand out: Hidrovia Tietê-Paraná
(which has a length of 2,400 km, 1,600 on the Paraná River and 800 km on the
Tietê River, draining agricultural production from the states of Mato Grosso,
Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and part of Rondônia, Tocantins and Minas General)
and Hidrovia do Solimões-Amazonas (it has two sections: Solimões, which
extends from Tabatinga to Manaus, with approximately 1600 km, and Amazonas,
which extends from Manaus to Belém, with 1650 km.

Almost entirely passenger transport from the Amazon basin is done by this
waterway, in addition to practically all cargo transportation that is directed
to the major regional centers of Belém and Manaus). In Brazil, this transport
is still underutilized: the most important waterway stretches, from an
economic point of view, are found in the Southeast and South of the country.
Its full use still depends on the construction of locks, major dredging works
and, mainly, of ports that allow intermodal integration.

### Products

Brazil was the 25th largest exporter in the world in 2020, with 1.1% of the
global total.

In 2021, Brazil exported US$280.4 billion and imported US$219.4 billion, with
a surplus of US$61 billion.

The country's top ten export products were:

  * Iron ore: US$42.2 billion
  * Soy: US$37.3 billion
  * Crude petroleum oils: US$27.4 billion
  * Sugar: US$8.5 billion
  * Beef: US$7.4 billion
  * Soybean meal: US$7.2 billion
  * Petroleum fuel oils: US$6.6 billion
  * Manufacturing Industry: US$6.4 billion
  * Chicken meat: US$6.3 billion
  * Cellulose: US$6.1 billion

The country also exports maize, coffee, cotton, tobacco, orange juice,
footwear, airplanes, helicopters, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol, semi-
finished iron, among others.

### Exports

The main countries to which Brazil exports in 2021 were:

  * China: US$87.6 billion (31.28%)
  * United States: US$31.1 billion (11.09%)
  * Argentina: US$11.8 billion (4.24%)
  * Netherlands: US$9.3 billion (3.32%)
  * Chile: US$6.9 billion (2.50%)
  * Singapore: US$5.8 billion (2.10%)
  * Mexico: US$5.5 billion (1.98%)
  * Germany: US$5.5 billion (1.97%)
  * Japan: US$5.5 billion (1.97%)
  * Spain: US$5.4 billion (1.94%)

The country's export model, until today, is excessively based on exports of
basic or semi-manufactured products, generating criticism, since such model
generates little monetary value, which prevents further growth in the country
in the long run. There are several factors that cause this problem, the main
ones being: the excessive collection of taxes on production (due to the
country's economic and legislative model being based on State Capitalism and
not on Free-Market Capitalism), the lack or deficiency of infrastructure
(means of transport such as roads, railways and ports that are insufficient or
weak for the country's needs, bad logistics and excessive bureaucracy) for
export, high production costs (expensive energy, expensive fuel, expensive
maintenance of trucks, expensive loan rates and bank financing for production,
expensive export rates), the lack of an industrial policy, the lack of focus
on adding value, the lack of aggressiveness in international negotiations, in
addition to abusive tariff barriers imposed by other countries on the
country's exports. Because of this, Brazil has never been very prominent in
international trade.

Due to its size and potential, it would be able to be among the 10 largest
exporters in the world, however, its participation in global commercial
transactions usually oscillates between 0.5 and 2% only. In 2019, among the
ten products that Brazil exports the most and that generate the most value,
eight come from the agribusiness. Although still modest, the country's exports
have evolved, and today they are more diversified than they were in the past.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 70% of Brazilian exports were restricted
to coffee. Overall, however, global trade still concentrates its few exports
on low-tech products (mainly agricultural and mineral commodities) and,
therefore, with low added value.

### Imports

The main countries from which Brazil imports in 2021 were:

  * China: US$47.6 billion (21.72%)
  * United States: US$39.3 billion (17.95%)
  * Argentina: US$11.9 billion (5.45%)
  * Germany: US$11.3 billion (5.17%)
  * India: US$6.7 billion (3.07%)
  * Russia: US$5.7 billion (2.60%)
  * Italy: US$5.4 billion (2.50%)
  * Japan: US$5.1 billion (2.35%)
  * South Korea: US$5.1 billion (2.33%)
  * France: US$4.8 billion (2.19%)

### Sustainable growth

Portuguese explorers arrived in 1500, but it was only in 1808 that Brazil
obtained a permit from the Portuguese colonial government to set up its first
factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil became the eighth
largest economy in the world. Originally, its exports were basic raw and
primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84% of exports are of
manufactured and semi-manufactured products.

The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875
and 1975.

In the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3%. Agribusiness
(agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47% or 3.6% per year, was the
most dynamic sector – even after having weathered international crises that
demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy. The Brazilian
government also launched a program for economic development acceleration
called Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento, aiming to spur growth.

Brazil's transparency rank in the international world is 75th according to
Transparency International.

### Control and reform

Among measures recently adopted to balance the economy, Brazil carried out
reforms to its social security (state and retirement pensions) and tax
systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of
Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive
branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments
were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to
encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating "windows of opportunity"
for local and international investors and producers.

With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it does
not import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through
exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by
20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector
or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a liquidity
crisis. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive
balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments,
services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country
will not be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.

In 2017, President Michel Temer refused to make public the list of companies
accused of "modern slavery". The list, made public yearly since the presidency
of Luís Inácio Lula da Silva in 2003, was intended to persuade companies to
settle their fines and conform to labor regulations, in a country where
corruption of the political class risked compromising respect for the law. The
relations of the president-in-office with the "landowner lobby" were denounced
by dismissed President Dilma Rousseff on this occasion.

### Consistent policies

Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active
and independent, Congress and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of
rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy
are the reduction of up to 30 percent on manufactured products tax (IPI), and
the investment of $8 billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus
improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation
of business and information telecenters.

The policy for industry, technology and foreign trade, at the forefront of
this sector, for its part, invests $19.5 billion in specific sectors,
following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and
medicine product, and capital goods sectors.

### Mergers and acquisitions

Between 1985 and 2017, 11,563 mergers & acquisitions with a total known value
of US$1,185 billion with the involvement of Brazilian firms were announced.
The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 billion of
transactions. It is worth noticing, that in the top 100 deals by value there
are only four cases of Brazilian companies acquiring a foreign company. This
reflects the strong interest in the country from a direct investment
perspective.

Here is a list of the largest deals where Brazilian companies took on either
the role of the acquiror or the target:

### Entrepreneurship

Embraer, a Brazilian company, is the third-largest commercial jet maker in the
world, just behind Airbus and Boeing.

According to a search of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in 2011 Brazil had 27
million adults aged between 18 and 64 either starting or owning a business,
meaning that more than one in four Brazilian adults were entrepreneurs. In
comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in
total number of entrepreneurs. The Institute of Applied Economic Research
(Ipea), a government agency, found that 37 million jobs in Brazil were
associated with businesses with less than 10 employees.

Even though Brazil ranks internationally as one of the hardest countries in
the region to do business due to its complicated bureaucracy, there is a
healthy number of entrepreneurs, thanks to the huge internal consumer market
and various government programs.

The most recent research of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor revealed in 2013
that 50.4% of Brazilian new entrepreneurs are men, 33.8% are in the 35–44 age
group, 36.9% completed high school and 47.9% earn 3–6 times the Brazilian
minimum wage. In contrast, 49.6% of entrepreneurs are female, only 7% are in
the 55–64 age group, 1% have postgraduate education and 1.7% earn more than 9
times the minimum wage.

### Credit rating

Brazil's credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor's (S&P) to BBB in
March 2014, just one notch above junk. It was further downgraded in January
2018 by S&P to BB−, which is 2 notches below investment grade.

### Climate change

There are multiple impacts of climate change on basic Brazilian production
systems, such as increasing existing shortages and increasing production
costs. It is also expected that more and more serious natural disasters will
occur. This will likely result in major problems for food supply, public
health, industrial production, trade, installed infrastructure, the general
quality of life of the population and national security as a whole, with the
poor suffering the most serious consequences. The areas most vulnerable to
major impacts are the Northeast and Southeast regions, exactly where most of
the Brazilian people are concentrated, and large cities, which in general are
poorly prepared to face the challenge.
