The economy of Russia is an emerging and developing, high-income,
industrialized, mixed market-oriented economy. It has the eleventh-largest
economy in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest economy by GDP
(PPP). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, its GDP measured in nominal
terms fluctuates sharply. Russia was the last major economy to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO), becoming a member in 2012.

Russia has large amounts of energy resources throughout its vast landmass,
particularly natural gas and petroleum, which play a crucial role in its
energy self-sufficiency and exports. The country has been widely described as
an energy superpower; with it having the largest natural gas reserves in the
world, the second-largest coal reserves, the eighth-largest oil reserves, and
the largest oil shale reserves in Europe. Russia is the world's leading
natural gas exporter, the second-largest natural gas producer, the second-
largest oil exporter and producer, and the third-largest coal exporter. Its
foreign exchange reserves are the fifth-largest in the world. Russia has a
labour force of about 73 million people, which is the eighth-largest in the
world. It is the third-largest exporter of arms in the world. The large oil
and gas sector accounted up to 30% of Russia's federal budget revenues in
2024, down from 50% in the mid-2010s, suggesting economic diversification.

Russia's human development is ranked as "very high" in the annual Human
Development Index. Roughly 70% of Russia's total GDP is driven by domestic
consumption, and the country has the world's twelfth-largest consumer market.
Its social security system comprised roughly 16% of the total GDP in 2015.
Russia has the fifth-highest number of billionaires in the world. However, its
income inequality remains comparatively high, caused by the variance of
natural resources among its federal subjects, leading to regional economic
disparities. High levels of corruption, a shrinking labor force, and an aging
and declining population also remain major barriers to future economic growth.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country has faced
extensive sanctions and other negative financial actions from the Western
world and its allies which have the aim of isolating the Russian economy from
the Western financial system. However, Russia's economy has shown resilience
to such measures broadly, and has maintained economic stability and
growth—driven primarily by high military expenditure, rising household
consumption and wages, low unemployment, and increased government spending.
Yet, inflation has remained comparatively high, with experts predicting the
sanctions will have a long-term negative effect on the Russian economy.

## History

The Russian economy has been volatile over the past multiple decades. After
1989, its institutional environment was transformed from a command economy
based upon socialist organizations to a capitalistic system. Its industrial
structure dramatically shifted away over the course of several years from
heavy investment in manufacturing as well as in traditional Soviet agriculture
towards free market related developments in natural gas and oil extraction in
additional to businesses engaged in mining. A service economy also expanded
during this time. The academic analyst Richard Connolly has argued that, over
the last four centuries in a broad sense, there were four main characteristics
of the Russian economy that have shaped the system and persisted despite the
political upheavals. First of all the weakness of the legal system means that
impartial courts do not rule and contracts are problematic. Second is the
underdevelopment of modern economic activities, with very basic peasant
agriculture dominant into the 1930s. Third is technological underdevelopment,
eased somewhat by borrowing from the West in the 1920s. And fourth lower
living standards compared to Western Europe and North America.

The economy of the Russian Empire covers the economic history of Russia from
1721 to the October Revolution of 1917 (which ushered in a period of civil
war, culminating in the creation of the Soviet Union).

Russian national income per capita increased and moved to closer to the most
developed economies of Northern and Western Europe from the late 17th century
to the mid 18th century. After the mid 18th century, the Russian economy
stagnated and declined. In the 18th century, Russian national income per
capita was about 40–70% of British per capita income but higher than Poland's.
By 1860, Russian GDP per capita was similar to that of Japan; one-third of GDP
per capita in the United States or the United Kingdom; and twice that of China
or India. Russia was a late industrializer. Over the course of the late 19th
century and early 20th century, Russia's railroad system expanded
considerably, enabling greater industrialization.

Serfdom, which held back development of the wage labor market and created a
shortage of labor for industry, was abolished in 1861. In the aftermath, GDP
per capita was volatile and did not substantially increase. Steady economic
growth began in the 1890s, alongside a structural transformation of the
Russian economy. By the time World War I started, more than half the Russian
economy was still devoted to agriculture. By the early 20th century, the
Russian economy had fallen further behind the American and British economies.
From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the economy grew at a
similar pace as the Japanese economy and faster than the Brazilian, Indian and
Chinese economies.

### Soviet Union

Beginning in 1928, the course of the Soviet Union's economy was guided by a
series of five-year plans. By the 1950s, the Soviet Union had rapidly evolved
from a mainly agrarian society into a major industrial power. By the 1970s the
Soviet Union was in an Era of Stagnation. The complex demands of the modern
economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central
planners. The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became
overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration
foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the
enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers,
and suppliers.

From 1975 to 1985, corruption and data manipulation became common practice
within the bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas, thus
entrenching the crisis. Starting in 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to
address economic problems by moving towards a market-oriented socialist
economy. Gorbachev's policies of Perestroika failed to rejuvenate the Soviet
economy; instead, a process of political and economic disintegration
culminated in the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

### Transition to market economy (1991–1998)

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia underwent a radical
transformation, moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally
integrated market economy. Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes
turned over major state-owned firms to politically connected "oligarchs",
which has left equity ownership highly concentrated.

Yeltsin's program of radical, market-oriented reform came to be known as a
"shock therapy". It was based on the policies associated with the Washington
Consensus, recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists,
including Larry Summers who in 1994 urged for "the three
'-ations'—privatization, stabilization, and liberalization" to be "completed
as soon as possible." With deep corruption afflicting the process, the result
was disastrous, with real GDP falling by more than 40% by 1999, hyperinflation
which wiped out personal savings, crime and destitution spreading rapidly. The
jump in prices from shock therapy wiped out the modest savings accumulated by
Russians under socialism and resulted in a regressive redistribution of wealth
in favour of elites who owned non-monetary assets.

Shock therapy was accompanied by a drop in the standard of living, including
surging economic inequality and poverty, along with increased excess mortality
and a decline in life expectancy. Russia suffered the largest peacetime rise
in mortality ever experienced by an industrialized country. Likewise, the
consumption of meat decreased: in 1990, an average citizen of the RSFSR
consumed 63 kg of meat a year; by 1999, it had decreased to 45 kg.

The majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and
subsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth.
For example, the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often
become the owner of the same enterprise. Under the government's cover,
outrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group
of individuals at key positions of business and government. Many of them
promptly invested their newfound wealth abroad, producing an enormous capital
flight. This rapid privatization of public assets, and the widespread
corruption associated with it, became widely known throughout Russia as
"prikhvatizatisiya," or "grab-itization."

Difficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and
dependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998
Russian financial crisis.

In the 1990s, Russia was a major borrower from the International Monetary
Fund, with loan facilities totalling $20 billion. The IMF was criticised for
lending so much, as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the
money and a large part of these funds could have been "diverted from their
intended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country
illegally".

On 24 September 1993, at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) Council of Heads of State in Moscow, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan signed the
Treaty on the creation of an Economic Union which reinforces by an
international agreement the intention to create an economic union through the
step-by-step creation of a free trade area, a customs union and conditions for
the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. All these countries
have ratified the Treaty and it entered into force on 14 January 1994.
Turkmenistan and Georgia joined in 1994 and ratified the Treaty, but Georgia
withdrew in 2009.

On 15 April 1994, at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
Council of Heads of State in Moscow, all 12 post-Soviet states signed the
international Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area in order to
move towards the creation of an economic union. Article 17 also confirmed the
intention to conclude a free trade agreement in services. Article 1 indicated
that this was "the first stage of the creation of the Economic Union", but in
1999 the countries agreed to remove this phrase from the agreement. Russia
concluded bilateral free trade agreements with all CIS countries and did not
switch to a multilateral free trade regime in 1999. Bilateral free trade
agreements, except for Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (all of these are
in force as of 2024), ceased to apply only after 2012 with Russia's accession
to the new multilateral CIS free trade area.

Further integration took place outside the legal framework of the CIS.
Pursuant to the Treaty on the creation of an Economic Union, the Agreement on
the Customs Union between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus
was signed on 6 January 1995 in Minsk. The Government of the Republic of
Belarus and the Government of the Russian Federation, on the one side, and the
Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, on the other side, signed an
Agreement on the Customs Union in Moscow on 20 January 1995 in order to move
towards the creation of an economic union as envisaged by the treaty. The
implementation of these agreements made it possible to launch the Customs
Union of the Eurasian Economic Community in 2010. According to the database of
international treaties of the Eurasian Economic Union, these agreements are
still in force as of 2024 and apply in part not contrary to the Treaty on the
Eurasian Economic Union.

International agreements such as the following have further deepened trade and
economic relations and integration with Belarus. The Community of Belarus and
Russia was founded on 2 April 1996. The "Treaty on the Union between Belarus
and Russia" was signed on 2 April 1997. And finally the Treaty on the Creation
of a Union State of Russia and Belarus was signed on 8 December 1999.

### Recovery and growth (1999–2008)

Price of oil in the 2000s

Russia recovered quickly from the August 1998 financial crash, partly because
of a devaluation of the ruble, which made domestic producers more competitive
nationally and internationally.

Between 2000 and 2002, significant pro-growth economic reforms included a
comprehensive tax reform, which introduced a flat income tax of 13%; and a
broad effort at deregulation which benefited small and medium-sized
enterprises.

Between 2000 and 2008, Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity
prices. GDP grew on average 7% per year. Disposable incomes more than doubled
and in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold. The volume of consumer
credit between 2000 and 2006 increased 45 times, fuelling a boom in private
consumption. The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30%
in 2000 to 14% in 2008.

Russia repaid its borrowing of $3.3 billion from the IMF three years early in
2005.

Inflation remained a problem however, as the central bank aggressively
expanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble. Nevertheless, in
2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved "unprecedented
macroeconomic stability". Until October 2007, Russia maintained impressive
fiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000.

### 2009–2014

Russian banks were affected by the 2008 financial crisis, though no long term
damage was done due to a proactive and timely response by the government and
central bank. A sharp, but brief recession in Russia was followed by a strong
recovery beginning in late 2009.

Between 2000 and 2012, Russia's energy exports fuelled a rapid growth in
living standards, with real disposable income rising by 160%. In dollar-
denominated terms this amounted to a more than sevenfold increase in
disposable incomes since 2000. In the same period, unemployment and poverty
more than halved and Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction also rose
significantly. This growth was a combined result of the 2000s commodities
boom, high oil prices, as well as prudent economic and fiscal policies.
However, these gains have been distributed unevenly, as the 110 wealthiest
individuals were found in a report by Credit Suisse to own 35% of all
financial assets held by Russian households. Russia also has the second-
largest volume of illicit money outflows, having lost over $880 billion
between 2002 and 2011 in this way. Since 2008 Forbes has repeatedly named
Moscow the "billionaire capital of the world".

In July 2010, Russia, together with Belarus and Kazakhstan, became a founding
member of the Customs Union of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC), and
the EurAsEC Single Economic Space, a common market of the same countries, came
into force on 1 January 2012, superseding the bilateral agreements on free
trade. At the same time Russia's membership to the WTO was accepted in 2011.
Russia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 22 August 2012 after 19
years of negotiations. On 20 September 2012, the multi-lateral Free Trade Area
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS FTA) came into force for Russia
and subsequently superseded previous bilateral agreements among 9
participating post-Soviet states. In 2015, Russia became a founding member of
the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which replaced EurAsEC and envisaged a
supranational economic union (the deepest stage of economic integration).

Rapid GDP and income growth continued until 2013. The most important topic of
discussion in the economy for a decade was the middle-income trap. In 2013,
the World Bank announced that Russia had graduated to a high-income economy
based on the results of 2012 but in 2016 it was reclassified as an upper-
middle income economy due to changes in the exchange rate of the Russian
ruble, which is a floating currency. While the UN Human Development Index,
which assesses progress in the standard of living, health and education, ranks
Russia among the 'very high human development' countries.

Russian leaders repeatedly spoke of the need to diversify the economy away
from its dependence on oil and gas and foster a high-technology sector. In
2012 oil, gas and petroleum products accounted for over 70% of total exports.
This economic model appeared to show its limits, when after years of strong
performance, the Russian economy expanded by a mere 1.3% in 2013. Several
reasons were proposed to explain the slowdown, including a prolonged recession
in the EU, which is Russia's largest trading partner, stagnant oil prices,
lack of spare industrial capacity and demographic problems. Political turmoil
in neighbouring Ukraine added to the uncertainty and suppressed investment.

### 2014–2021

Factbook. Russia has the world's largest reserves.

Following the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and Russia's involvement in
the ongoing War in Donbas, the United States, the European Union, Canada, and
Japan imposed sanctions on Russia. This led to the decline of the Russian
ruble and sparked fears of a Russian financial crisis. Russia responded with
sanctions against a number of countries, including a one-year period of total
ban on food imports from the European Union and the United States.

According to the Russian economic ministry in July 2014, GDP growth in the
first half of 2014 was 1%. The ministry projected growth of 0.5% for 2014. The
Russian economy grew by a better than expected 0.6% in 2014. Russia is rated
one of the most unequal of the world's major economies.

As a result of the World Bank's designation of a high-income economy, Barack
Obama issued a proclamation 9188: "I have determined that Russia is
sufficiently advanced in economic development and improved in trade
competitiveness that it is appropriate to terminate the designation of Russia
as a beneficiary developing country effective October 3, 2014." U.S. Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) indicated that Russia formally graduated from the
GSP program on 4 October 2014.

As of 2015, real income was still lower for 99% of Russians than it was in
1991.

The Russian economy risked going into recession from early 2014, mainly due to
falling oil prices, sanctions, and the subsequent capital flight. While in
2014 GDP growth remained positive at 0.6%, in 2015 the Russian economy shrunk
by 3.7% and was expected to shrink further in 2016. By 2016, the Russian
economy rebounded with 0.3% GDP growth and officially exited recession. The
growth continued in 2017, with an increase of 1.5%.

In January 2016, Bloomberg rated Russia's economy as the 12th most innovative
in the world, up from 14th in January 2015 and 18th in January 2014. Russia
has the world's 15th highest patent application rate, the 8th highest
concentration of high-tech public companies, such as internet and aerospace
and the third highest graduation rate of scientists and engineers.

According to the British company BP (Statistical Yearbook 2018), proven oil
reserves in Russia at the end of 2017 were 14.5 billion tonnes (14.3 billion
long tons; 16.0 billion short tons), natural gas was 35 trillion cubic metres
(1.2 quadrillion cubic feet). Gold reserves in Russia's subsoil, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey, were 5,500 tonnes (5,400 long tons; 6,100 short
tons) at the end of 2017.

In 2019, the Ministry of Natural Resources estimated the country's mineral
reserves in physical terms. At the end of 2017, oil reserves were 9.04 billion
tonnes (8.90 billion long tons; 9.96 billion short tons), gas reserves were
14.47 trillion cubic metres (511 trillion cubic feet), gold reserves were
1,407 tonnes (1,385 long tons; 1,551 short tons), and diamonds reserves were
375 million carats (75 tonnes). Then for the first time the Ministry evaluated
the mineral reserves of Russia in terms of value. The value of oil reserves
amounted to 39.6 trillion rubles, the value of gas amounted to 11.3 trillion
rubles, coking coal amounted to almost 2 trillion rubles, iron ore amounted to
808 billion rubles, diamonds amounted to 505 billion rubles, gold amounted to
480 billion rubles. The combined value of all mineral and energy resources
(oil, gas, gold, copper, iron ore, thermal and lignite coal, and diamonds)
amounted to 55.24 trillion rubles (US$844 billion), or 60% of GDP for 2017.
The assessment occurred after the adoption of a new classification of reserves
in Russia and the object of the methodology was only those fields for which a
license was issued, so the assessment of the Ministry of Natural Resources is
less than the total volume of explored reserves. Experts criticized such "an
unsuccessful attempt to estimate reserves," pointing out that "one should not
take such an estimate seriously" and "the form contains an incorrect formula
for calculating the value".

In the International Comparison Program 2021, the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) region was linked through the standard global core list approach,
unlike in ICP 2017. Based on the results, the World Bank announced that in
2021 Russia was the 4th largest economy in the world ($5.7 trillion and 3.8
percent of the world) and the largest economy in Europe and Central Asia when
measured in PPP terms.

### 2022–present

Like some other major economies like the United States, China, Brazil, Japan,
Argentina and others, Russia has one of the world's lowest import dependence
as a percentage of GDP among more than 200 countries and territories over the
past 30 years. Sanctions, boycotts and disruption of supply chains in 2022 led
to a drop of import from 20.7% (top-15) to 15.6% (top-5).

In 2022, heavy sanctions were enacted due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine
which will likely result in a steep recession. Since early 2022, many official
economic statistics have not been published. Sanctions also included asset
freezes on the Russian Central Bank, which holds $630 billion in foreign-
exchange reserves, to prevent it from offsetting the effects of sanctions.

According to most estimates, every day of the war in Ukraine costs Russia $500
million to $1 billion.

On 27 June 2022, Russia defaulted on part of its foreign currency, its first
such default since 1918.

In November 2022, it was reported that Russia had officially entered a
recession as the Federal State Statistics Service had reported a national GDP
loss for the second consecutive quarter.

As part of the sanctions imposed on Russia, on 2 September 2022, the finance
ministers of the G7 group agreed to cap the price of Russian oil and petroleum
products, designed to allow Russia to maintain production, but limiting
revenue from oil sales.

In 2022, _The Economist_ calculated that Russia did graduate into the category
of high-income economies by 2022, if counted at purchasing power parity rather
than the exchange rate but could fall below the threshold due to the invasion
of Ukraine. In December 2022, a study at Bank of Russia's Research and
Forecasting Department, found that the import dependence of the Russian
economy is relatively low, does not exceed the median for other countries, and
the share of imports in most industries is lower than in other countries. The
key explanation for this could be the low involvement of the Russian economy
in global value supply chains and its focus on production of raw materials.
However, 60% of Russia's imports come from the countries that have announced
sanctions against Russia.

TASS reported poor results for the Russian economy the first quarter of 2023
with revenue of 5.7 trillion roubles – down 21% (mainly due to falling oil
revenue), expenditure 8.1 trillion roubles – up 34% (mainly due to increased
military costs), creating a deficit 2.4 trillion roubles – ($29.4 billion)

Following Central Bank of Russia interventions, the exchange rate of the
rouble against the dollar remained relatively stable in 2022, although in 2023
it started to decrease significantly, reaching RUB 97 per USD 1 on 15 August
2023. Both the interventions and the exchange rate decrease resulted in
significant criticism of the Central Bank by Russian state propaganda. Quarter
2 of 2023 saw a 13% fall in the value of the rouble against the dollar and a
current account surplus estimated in to be falling by 80% from the annual 2022
surplus of $233 billion.

After 11 years of negotiations, on 8 June 2023, in Sochi, Armenia, Belarus,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan signed the
Commonwealth of Independent States Agreement on Free Trade in Services,
Establishment, Operations and Investment to partly integrate Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan on the common standards of the WTO (General Agreement on Trade in
Services) and the EAEU (some provisions were borrowed from EAEU law) even
without their membership in the WTO (Uzbekistan) or the EAEU (Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan). The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union has preserved
international agreements on trade in services in the sphere of national
competence of the member states therefore, the EAEU is not a party to the
agreement.

In August and September 2023, the Central Bank of Russia started raising the
key lending rate, ending up at 13% in September, while USD to RUB exchange
rate remained at RUB 95. As of June 2023 share of Russia's exports to EU
dropped to 1.7% while Russia's imports from EU dropped to 1.5%. In October
2023 the "psychological barrier" of RUB 100 per USD 1 was crossed. In July
2024 the Russian Central Bank raised the key interest rate to 18%.

The 2024 budget expects revenues of 35 trillion rubles ($349 billion) with
expenditure of 36.6 trillion, based on a Urals oil forecast of $71.30 per
barrel, a 90.1 rubles to USD 1 exchange rate and inflation of 4.5%. Defence
spending will double to 10.78 trillion, 29.4% of expenditure. Russia currently
has a record low unemployment rate of just 3 percent, due to a demographic
decline, demands of the war for industrial and military manpower, and large
scale emigration.

In January 2025, it was reported that Russia had used a two-prong strategy to
finance the large costs of the Russo-Ukrainian war since early 2022. In
addition to the official Russian government defense budget —direct financial
expenditure for waging the war was estimated at US$250 billion through June
2024, rising to over 20% of annual GDP—an off-budget financing mechanism was
employed to fund the war with over US$200 billion from preferential bank loans
made to defence contractors and war-related businesses, loans compelled by the
Russian government.

Russian economy had a significant expansion in 2023, because it is crowded out
by defense spending. This became an inflationary output gap, which lead to a
stagnation, and became a recession in 2025. Until 2026 Russian economy is
expected to have a stagnation, because of the shrinking of the output gap,
with the risk of a stagflation still remaining.

## Data

Original data are obtained and published in the national currency of the
Russian Federation, the Russian ruble, by the Federal State Statistics Service
Rosstat, as well as other organizations of which Russia is a member, such as
the Eurasian Economic Commission and the Statistical Committee of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. Due to the conversion of values into other
currencies, the volume in other nominal currencies may fluctuate sharply. The
average annual exchange rate of the ruble is usually used to convert annual
data. The World Bank uses the Atlas method (a three-year average) to estimate
GNI. Purchasing power parities is calculated as part of the successive cycles
of the World Bank's International Comparison Program and comes into effect
after several years (ICP 2021 data were published in May 2024 and applies by
the World Bank since July 2024 and by the IMF since October 2024).

## Income inequality

In Russia, areas where income is higher have increased air pollution. However
while income may have been higher in these regions a greater disparity in
income inequality was found. It was discovered that "greater income inequality
within a region is associated with more pollution, implying that it is not
only the level of income that matters but also its distribution". In Russia
areas lacking in hospital beds suffer from greater air pollution than areas
with higher numbers of beds per capita which implies that the poor or
inadequate distribution of public services also may add to the environmental
inequality of that region.

## Currency and monetary policy

On 25 December 1993, the Constitution of the Russian Federation came into
force, where the main provisions were prescribed in the Article 75. The
currency in the Russian Federation is the ruble. Monetary emission is carried
out exclusively by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (the Bank of
Russia). The introduction and emission of other money in the Russian
Federation is not allowed. The protection and ensuring the stability of the
ruble is the main function of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,
which it carries out independently of other government bodies. On 1 September
2013, the Bank of Russia also became a regulator of financial markets,
applying the integrated model of financial sector supervision.

The Central Bank of the Russian Federation follows inflation targeting policy.
Higher inflation than in developed countries has remained throughout the last
25–30 post-Soviet years and the devaluation of the currency (in relation to
foreign currencies and in relation to domestic goods) is significantly
compensated by higher interest rates and an increase in nominal incomes and
assets. This situation is typical for developing markets. Typically
devaluations of the ruble relative to foreign currency strongly stimulate the
export-oriented economy of Russia.

### Foreign exchange

The currency exchange rate of the Russian ruble is floating.

In 2011, the Bank of Russia, which was then headed by Sergei Ignatiev, took a
course towards abolishing the currency corridor and designated a transition to
a floating exchange rate for the ruble. Already under the new head of the
Central Bank of the Russian Federation, Elvira Nabiullina, it was planned to
complete the transition to a floating exchange rate regime from 1 January
2015. The Bank of Russia dismantled the currency corridor two months earlier -
on 10 November 2014, so as not to waste gold and foreign exchange reserves. A
2025 study said that an important constraint on the economy was “Russia’s
dependence on hard currencies like the dollar and the euro, with only partial
“yuanization” of its foreign trade transactions”.

Ruble's Real Effective Exchange Rate remained in 2022–24 higher and stronger
than in 1994 and 1998 when the sharp devaluations happened relative to the
foreign currency.

## Public policy

### Federal, regional and municipal budgets

### Fiscal policy

Russia was expected to have a Government Budget deficit of $21 billion in
2016. The budget deficit narrowed to 0.6% of GDP in 2017 from 2.8% in 2016.

### Debts

Russia is a creditor nation and has a positive net international investment
position (NIMP). Russia has one of the lowest government debts (total external
and domestic) and lowest external debts (total public and private) among major
economies.

In 2022, domestic government debt increased by 13.9 percent to 18.78 billion
rubles. Russia Domestic government Debt data was reported at RUB 19,801.921
billion in May 2023.

In 2022, the share of external debt to GDP was 17%, decreasing from 26.3% in
2021. Russia's external debt was estimated at 381.8 billion U.S. dollars as of
1 January 2023, down 20.8 percent from the previous year. Russia External Debt
reached USD 357.9 billion in March 2023, compared with USD 380.5 billion in
the previous quarter.

### National wealth fund

On 1 January 2004, the Government of Russia established the Stabilization fund
of the Russian Federation as part of the federal budget to balance it if price
of oil falls. On 1 February 2008, the Stabilization fund was divided into two
parts. The first is a reserve fund equal to 10% of GDP and was to be invested
in a similar way as the Stabilization Fund. The second is the National Welfare
Fund of the Russian Federation to be invested in more risky instruments,
including some shares in domestic and foreign companies. The Reserve fund
which started with $125 billion was exhausted by 2017 and discontinued. The
National Wealth Fund had started with $32 billion in 2008 and by August 2022,
peaked at $201 billion. December 2023 saw it fall to $133 billion with liquid
assets also down at $56 billion.

### Corruption

Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International, 2019

Russia was the lowest rated European country in Transparency International's
Corruption Perceptions Index for 2020; ranking 129th out of 180 countries.
Corruption is perceived as a significant problem in Russia, affecting various
aspects of life, including the economy, business, public administration, law
enforcement, healthcare, and education. The phenomenon of corruption is
strongly established in the historical model of public governance in Russia
and attributed to general weakness of rule of law in Russia. As of 2020, the
percentage of business owners who distrust law enforcement agencies rose to
70% (from 45% in 2017); 75% don't believe in impartiality of courts and 79% do
not believe that legal institutions protect them from abuse of law such as
racketeering or arrest on dubious grounds.

## Regional economies and economic regions

### Federal subjects

According to the Moscow Government, the Moscow economy is the largest among
the Russian Federation constituent entities: the capital accounts for one
fifth of the country's total gross regional product. Moscow is one of the
largest urban economies in the world in terms of GDP (purchasing power parity,
PPP) and one of the top 5 global megalopolises according to this value. The
Moscow GDP (PPP) in 2021 amounted to USD 25.500 billion, which is more than
that of Seoul, Shanghai or Paris. The Government refers to Oxford Economics
stating that Moscow ranked third among the world's cities in terms of GDP at
purchasing power parity.

According to statements by the Mayor of Moscow in 2024, Moscow contributes
more than 20 per cent of the country's GDP. This contribution is related to
innovation, IT sector and services. Labour productivity in Moscow is on
average 2.5 times higher than in Russia due to the high concentration of
residents.

Moscow is home to 90 billionaires in 2025 – 16 more than a year ago. Moscow
comes in second place behind New York City according to Forbes. Moscow is home
to 30,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), whose wealth is estimated at $1
million, according to Henley & Partners.

### Groupings

Russia is divided into twelve economic regions.

In 2018, the Russian Ministry of Economic Development developed a strategy for
the spatial development of Russia, in which it was proposed to introduce the
division into 14 macro-regions. In February 2019, the strategy was approved
and the division into 12 macro-regions was implemented.

There are also macrozones such as the Baikal Amur Mainline economic zone.

### Centre-periphery model

According to a 2011 research article, the nature of the relationship between
the centre and the regions in Russia today corresponds to the so-called
"centre-periphery" model; excessive centralisation, the absence of alternative
(to Moscow) centres in the country's territorial structure and weak horizontal
links are stable characteristics of the Russian political and economic space
and are constantly reproduced over time.

More than a decade ago, Professor Natalia Zubarevich proposed an extension of
the centre-periphery model and is known as the author of the "theory of four
Russias". According to Zubarevich, the different speed of social modernisation
is more accurately explained by the centre-periphery model. The entire
population of the country can be divided into three roughly equal parts -
about a third of citizens in each. The underdeveloped republics, where 6% of
the country's population lives - this "fourth" Russia has its own specific
features. According to the concept, "First Russia" is the cities with millions
of inhabitants, i.e. the most modernised and economically developed
territories. "Second Russia" are medium-sized cities with a pronounced
industrial profile. "Third Russia" - small towns, workers' settlements, rural
areas. Compared to "first" and "second Russia" - this is a deep periphery in
terms of the quality of socio-economic life. The "fourth Russia" is made up of
the national republics of the Caucasus, as well as the south of Siberia (Tuva,
the Altai Republic). These territories also represent a periphery, but a
specific one: the demographic transition has not been completed here,
urbanisation is in its infancy, and patriarchal-clan principles are still
strong in society.

Monoprofile towns (monotowns) are the most unstable part of the "second
Russia".

## Sectors

### Primary

#### Energy

Until 2022, Russia was a key oil and gas supplier to much of Europe. Rosneft
headquarters on the bank of the Moskva River, Moscow

The mineral-packed Ural Mountains and the vast fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal),
and timber reserves of Siberia and the Russian Far East make Russia rich in
natural resources, which dominate Russian exports. Oil and gas exports,
specifically, continue to be the main source of hard currency.

Russia has been widely described as an energy superpower; as it has the
world's largest natural gas reserves, the second-largest coal reserves, the
eighth-largest oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe. It
is the world's leading natural gas exporter, the second-largest natural gas
producer, the second-largest oil exporter and producer, and the third largest
coal exporter. Fossil fuels cause most of the greenhouse gas emissions by
Russia. The country is the world's fourth-largest electricity producer, and
the ninth-largest renewable energy producer in 2019. Russia was also the
world's first country to develop civilian nuclear power, and built the world's
first nuclear power plant. In 2019, It was the world's fourth-largest nuclear
energy producer. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian state
nuclear conglomerate Rosatom became the dominant actor in international
nuclear power markets, training experts, constructing nuclear power plants,
supplying fuel and taking care of spent fuel in around the world. Whereas oil
and gas were subject to international sanctions after Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2023, its nuclear industry was not targeted by
sanctions.

In the mid-2000s, the share of the oil and gas sector in GDP was around 20%,
and in 2013 it was 20–21% of GDP. The share of oil and gas in Russia's exports
(about 50%) and federal budget revenues (about 50%) is large, and the dynamics
of Russia's GDP are highly dependent on oil and gas prices, but the share in
GDP is much less than 50%. According to the first such comprehensive
assessment published by the Russian statistics agency Rosstat in 2021, the
maximum total share of the oil and gas sector in Russia's GDP, including
extraction, refining, transport, sale of oil and gas, all goods and services
used, and all supporting activities, amounts to 16.9% in 2017, 21.1% in 2018,
19.2% in 2019 and 15.2% in 2020. To compare the data obtained using the same
methodology, the source provides data for other countries. This is more than
the share of GDP in the United States (8%) and Canada (less 10%). This is
comparable to the share of GDP in Norway (14%) and Kazakhstan (13.3%). It is
much lower than the share of GDP in the United Arab Emirates (30%) and Saudi
Arabia (50%). This assessment did not include, for example, the production of
used pumps or specialized education, which should have been included,
according to experts. Russia consumes domestically two-thirds of its gas
production and a quarter of its oil production while it sells three-quarters
of its oil on the world market and Russia's share of the traded world oil
market is 17.5% - more than Saudi Arabia's. At the same time, experts note
that there are formal and informal part of the rent and the total oil and gas
rent in 2023 can be estimated at 24% of Russia's GDP. Michael Alexeyev (son of
Lyudmila Alexeyeva), a professor of economics at Indiana University, notes
that the oil and gas taxes reported by the government do not include corporate
dividends and the so-called indirect or additional revenues derived from the
expenditure of oil and gas rents in the economy. There is also such an
indicator as the oil rent (% of GDP), which is published by the World Bank. It
is 9.7% for Russia, 14.8% for Kazakhstan, 6.1% for Norway, 23.7% for Saudi
Arabia, 15.7% for the United Arab Emirates, 2.8% for Canada and 0.6% for the
United States.

2023 saw a fall in Russia's oil and gas tax revenues of 24% to 8.8 trillion
roubles ($99.4 billion) compared to 2022.

#### Mining

Russia is also a leading producer and exporter of minerals and gold. Russia is
the largest diamond-producing nation in the world, estimated to produce over
33 million carats in 2013, or 25% of global output valued at over $3.4
billion, with state-owned ALROSA accounting for approximately 95% of all
Russian production.

In 2019, the country was the 3rd world producer of gold; 2nd worldwide
producer of platinum; 4th worldwide producer of silver; 9th largest world
producer of copper; 3rd largest world producer of nickel; 6th largest world
producer of lead; 9th largest world producer of bauxite; 10th largest world
producer of zinc; 2nd worldwide producer of vanadium; 2nd largest world
producer of cobalt; 5th largest world producer of iron ore; 7th largest world
producer of boron; 9th largest world producer of molybdenum; 13th largest
world producer of tin; 3rd largest world producer of sulfur; 4th largest world
producer of phosphate; 8th largest world producer of gypsum; in addition to
being the world's 10th largest producer of salt. It was the world's 6th
largest producer of uranium in 2018.

#### Agriculture

A combine harvester in Rostov Oblast

Russia's agriculture sector contributes about 5% of the country's total GDP,
although the sector employs about one-eighth of the total labour force. It has
the world's third-largest cultivated area, at 1,265,267 square kilometres
(488,522 sq mi). However, due to the harshness of its environment, about 13.1%
of its land is agricultural, and only 7.4% of its land is arable. The main
product of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies considerably
more than half of the cropland. Russia is the world's largest exporter of
wheat, and is the largest producer of barley, buckwheat, oats, and rye, and
the second-largest producer of sunflower seed. Various analysts of climate
change adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during
the rest of the 21st century as arability increases in Siberia, which would
lead to both internal and external migration to the region.

More than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the
remaining farmland is devoted to industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits.
Owing to its large coastline along three oceans, Russia maintains one of the
world's largest fishing fleets, ranking sixth in the world in tonnage of fish
caught; capturing 4.77 million tonnes (4.69 million long tons; 5.26 million
short tons) of fish in 2018. It is also home to the world's finest caviar (the
beluga), and produces about one-third of all canned fish, and some one-fourth
of the world's total fresh and frozen fish.

### Industry

#### Defence industry

The defence industry of Russia is a strategically important sector and a large
employer in the country. Russia has a large and sophisticated arms industry,
capable of designing and manufacturing high-tech military equipment, including
a fifth-generation fighter jet, nuclear powered submarines, firearms, and
short range/long range ballistic missiles. It is the world's second-largest
exporter of arms, behind only the United States.

#### Aerospace

The Sukhoi Superjet 100 is one of Russia's most recent civilian aviation
products. The regional passenger plane was ordered around 280 times for
various airlines and leasing companies as of 2018.

Aircraft manufacturing is an important industry sector in Russia, employing
around 355,300 people. The Russian aircraft industry offers a portfolio of
internationally competitive military aircraft such as MiG-29 and Su-30, while
new projects such as the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are hoped to revive the fortunes
of the civilian aircraft segment. In 2009, companies belonging to the United
Aircraft Corporation delivered 95 new fixed-wing aircraft to its customers,
including 15 civilian models. In addition, the industry produced over 141
helicopters. It is one of the most science-intensive hi-tech sectors and
employs the largest number of skilled personnel. The production and value of
the military aircraft branch far outstrips other defence industry sectors, and
aircraft products make up more than half of the country's arms exports.

The Space industry of Russia consists of over 100 companies and employs
250,000 people.

#### Automotive industry

Russian automotive industry. Aurus Senat, a recent armoured limousine project
by NAMI

Automotive production is a significant industry in Russia, directly employing
around 600,000 people or 1% of the country's total workforce. Russia produced
1,767,674 vehicles in 2018, ranking 13th among car-producing nations in 2018,
and accounting for 1.8% of the worldwide production. Following the 2022
sanctions and the withdrawal of Western manufacturers the production dropped
to 450,000 passenger cars in 2022, the lowest level since the dissolution of
the Soviet Union in 1991. The main local brands are light vehicle producers
AvtoVAZ and GAZ, while KamAZ is the leading heavy vehicle producer. In
December 2022 the only foreign car manufacturers are eleven Chinese carmakers
that have production operations or are constructing their plants in Russia.

#### Electronics

Russia was experiencing a regrowth of microelectronics, with the revival of
JCS Mikron until sanctions took effect in 2022.

### Services

#### Retail

As of 2013, Russians spent 60% of their pre-tax income on shopping, the
highest percentage in Europe. This is possible because many Russians pay no
rent or house payments, owning their own home after privatization of state-
owned Soviet housing. Shopping malls were popular with international investors
and shoppers from the emerging middle class. Russia had over 1,000 shopping
malls in 2020, although in 2022, many international companies left Russia
resulting in empty stores in malls. A supermarket selling groceries is a
typical anchor store in a Russian mall.

#### Telecommunications

Russia's telecommunications industry is growing in size and maturity. As of
December 2007, there were an estimated 4,900,000 broadband lines in Russia.

As of 2020[update], 122,488,468 Russians (85% of the country's total
population) were Internet users.

There are four national mobile phone networks, MegaFon, Tele2, Beeline and MTS
with total subscriptions between 2011 and 2021 ranging between 200 and 240
million.

#### Transportation

The Trans-Siberian Railway, the longest railway-line in the world, as seen
across the coast of Lake Baikal The Russky Bridge in Vladivostok is the
longest cable-stayed bridge in the world.

Railway transport in Russia is mostly under the control of the state-run
Russian Railways. The total length of common-used railway tracks is the
world's third-longest, and exceeds 87,157 km (54,157 mi). As of 2016[update],
Russia has 1,452.2 thousand km of roads, and its road density is among the
world's lowest. Russia's inland waterways are the world's second-longest, and
total 102,000 km (63,380 mi). Among Russia's 1,218 airports, the busiest is
Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow.

Russia's largest port is the Port of Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai along the
Black Sea. Russia is the world's sole country to operate nuclear-powered
icebreakers, which advance the economic exploitation of the Arctic continental
shelf of Russia, and the development of sea trade through the Northern Sea
Route.

#### Construction

The Port of Novorossiysk

In 2022, construction was worth 13 trillion rubles, 5% more than in 2021.
Residential construction in 2022 reached 126.7 million square metres (1,364
million square feet).

The 2020–2030 target for construction is 1 billion square metres (1.1×1010
square feet) of housing, 20% of all housing stock to be renovated and to
increase space from 27.8 square metres (299 sq ft) up to 33.3 square metres
(358 sq ft) per person.

#### Insurance

According to the Central Bank of Russia 422 insurance companies operate on the
Russian insurance market by the end of 2013. The concentration of insurance
business is significant across all major segments except compulsory motor
third party liability market (CMTPL) [ru], as the top 10 companies in 2013
charged 58.1% premiums in total without compulsory health insurance (CHI).
Russian insurance market in 2013 demonstrated quite significant rate of growth
in operations. Total amount of premiums charged (without CHI) in 2013 is RUB
904.9 bln (increase on 11.8% compared to 2012), total amount of claims paid is
RUB 420.8 bln (increase on 13.9% compared to 2012). Premiums to GDP ratio
(total without CHI) in 2013 increased to 1.36% compared to 1.31 a year before.
The share of premiums in household spending increased to 1.39%. Level of
claims paid on the market total without CHI is 46.5%, an insufficient increase
compared to 2012. The number of policies in 2013 increased on 0.1% compared to
2012, to 139.6 mln policies.

Although relative indicators of the Russian insurance market returned to pre-
crisis levels, the progress is achieved mainly by the increase of life
insurance and accident insurance, the input of these two market segments in
premium growth in 2013 largely exceeds their share on the market. As before,
life insurance and accident insurance are often used by banks as an appendix
to a credit contract protecting creditors from the risk of credit default in
case of borrower's death or disability. The rise of these lines is connected,
evidently, with the increase in consumer loans, as the total sum of credit
obligations of population in 2013 increased by 28% to RUB 9.9 trillion. At the
same time premium to GDP ratio net of life and accident insurance remained at
the same level of 1.1% as in 2012. Thus, if "banking" lines of business are
excluded, Russian insurance market is in stagnation stage for the last four
years, as premiums to GDP ratio net of life and accident insurance remains at
the same level of 1.1% since 2010.

#### Information technology

Russia has more academic graduates than any other country in Europe (and world
leader in percentage of population with associate degree or higher: 54%,
compared to 31% in UK).

The IT market is one of the most dynamic sectors of the Russian economy.
Russian software exports have risen from just $120 million in 2000 to $3.3
billion in 2010. Since the year 2000 the IT market has started growth rates of
30–40% a year, growing by 54% in 2006 alone. The biggest sector in terms of
revenue is system and network integration, which accounts for 28.3% of the
total market revenues. Meanwhile, the fastest growing segment of the IT market
is offshore programming.

Interior of the Beriev Scientific and Technical Complex in Taganrog

The government has launched a program promoting construction of IT-oriented
technology parks (Technoparks)—special zones that have an established
infrastructure and enjoy a favorable tax and customs regime, in seven
different locations: Moscow, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Kaluga, Tumen,
Republic of Tatarstan and St. Peterburg Region.

Under a government decree signed in June 2013, a special "roadmap" is expected
to ease business suppliers' access to the procurement programs of state-owned
infrastructure monopolies, including such large ones as Gazprom, Rosneft,
Russian Railways, Rosatom, and Transneft. These companies will be expected to
increase the proportion of domestic technology solutions they use in their
operations. The decree puts special emphasis on purchases of innovation
products and technologies. According to the new decree, by 2015, government-
connected companies must double their purchases of Russian technology
solutions compared to the 2013 level and their purchasing levels must
quadruple by 2018.

Russia is one of the few countries in the world with a homegrown internet
search engine with a significant marketshare as the Russian-based search
engine Yandex is used by 53.8% of internet users in the country.

Known Russian IT companies are ABBYY (FineReader OCR system and Lingvo
dictionaries), Kaspersky Lab (Kaspersky Anti-Virus, Kaspersky Internet
Security), Mail.Ru (portal, search engine, mail service, Mail.ru Agent
messenger, ICQ, Odnoklassniki social network, online media sources).

#### Tourism

Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg, a UNESCO World Heritage Site

According to a UNWTO report, Russia is the sixteenth-most visited country in
the world, and the tenth-most visited country in Europe, as of 2018, with 24.6
million visits. Russia is ranked 39th in the Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness Report 2019. According to Federal Agency for Tourism, the
number of inbound trips of foreign citizens to Russia amounted to 24.4 million
in 2019. Russia's international tourism receipts in 2018 amounted to $11.6
billion. In 2020, tourism accounted for about 4% of country's GDP. Major
tourist routes in Russia include a journey around the Golden Ring theme route
of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like the Volga, and journeys on
the famous Trans-Siberian Railway. Russia's most visited and popular landmarks
include Red Square, the Peterhof Palace, the Kazan Kremlin, the Trinity Lavra
of St. Sergius and Lake Baikal.

## Economic integration  
  
---  
Top 4 largest economies (China, the US, India, Russia) in the world by PPP-
adjusted GDP in 2023  
according to the World Bank, the members of the Eurasian Economic Union as
well as  
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan that are forming a common market within the CIS
(EAEU+2)  
  
Russia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 22 August 2012. On 20
September 2012, the Free Trade Agreement of the Commonwealth of Independent
States signed on 18 October 2011 came into force (CIS FTA) for Russia and
superseded previous agreements. Russia is a founding member of the Eurasian
Economic Union (EAEU) and is party to EAEU trade agreements with Vietnam,
Iran, Singapore, and Serbia. In 2018, the EAEU signed a trade cooperation
agreement with China, and it is in trade negotiations with India, Israel, and
Egypt. Russia is also a party to several agreements that predate the EAEU. The
EAEU Treaty in 2015 superseded previous integration agreements and envisaged
an economic union (the deepest stage of economic integration). The EAEU
provides for free movement of goods, services, capital and labour without a
work permit ("four economic freedoms" as in the European Union), pursues
coordinated, harmonized and single policy in the sectors determined by the
Treaty and international agreements within the Union. The EAEU has a Eurasian
Customs Union and an integrated single market of 183 million people.

## External trade and investment

Over the past 30 years, the share of imports of goods and services as a share
of Russia's GDP has been below 25% for almost all years. The growth of oil
rents, rapid economic growth, economic integration, WTO accession, improved
transport accessibility and the government's import substitution program
hardly changed the percentage, and only sanctions and boycotts in 2022 led to
a drop to 15.6%.

### Trade

Russia recorded a trade surplus of US$15.8 billion in 2013. Balance of trade
in Russia is reported by the Central Bank of Russia. Historically, from 1997
until 2013, Russia balance of trade averaged US$8.338billion reaching an all-
time high of US$20.647 billion in December 2011 and a record low of −185 US$
million in February 1998. Russia runs regular trade surpluses primarily due to
exports of commodities.

In 2015, Russia main exports are oil and natural gas (62.8% of total exports),
ores and metals (5.9%), chemical products (5.8%), machinery and transport
equipment (5.4%) and food (4.7%). Others include: agricultural raw materials
(2.2%) and textiles (0.2%).

Russia top exports in 2021 were: Crude oil $110.9b, Processed oil $69.9b, gold
$17.3b, coal $15.4b and natural gas $7.3b.

Russia top imports in 2021 were: Transmission equipment $10.7b, medication
$7.3b, tankers $3.7b, parts and accessories for data processing 3.7b and
storage units $3.3b.

### 2013–present

In 2017, Russian Federation's commercial services' shares of total exports and
imports were 13.9% and 26.8%, respectively. Russian Federation had a trade-to-
GDP ratio of 46.6% in 2017. In 2013–2017, Russia had a trade surplus for
goods, and a trade deficit for services. Since trade in goods is larger than
trade in services, Russia had a significant trade surplus. Trade is relatively
important to the Russian economy: the ratio of Russia's goods trade (exports
plus imports) to GDP has averaged about 40% in recent years, compared to 20%
for the United States. In 2021, Russia ranked 13th among world goods exporters
and 22nd among importers. According to Russian official sources, its goods
exports totaled $492 billion in 2021, up 46% from 2020 (not adjusting for
inflation). Minerals, including oil and gas, made up nearly 45% of these
exports. Goods imports rose by 27%, reaching $294 billion in 2021. Machinery
and mechanical appliances topped the list of imports, accounting for almost a
third of Russia's goods imports. In services trade, Russia ranked 26th among
world exporters and 19th among importers in 2020, the most recent year for
which data is available. The country was a net importer of services, exporting
$49 billion worth of services and importing $76 billion.

According to the World Bank, imports of goods and services accounted for 21.3%
of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021, while exports made up 30.9%.
Russia has trade-to-GDP ratio (trade openness) 49.26% which is below the
global average. In a December 2022 study, an economist from the Bank of
Russia's Research and Forecasting Department found that Russia's import
dependence is relatively low, does not exceed the median for other countries
and the share of imports in most industries is lower than in other countries.
The key explanation for this could be the low involvement of the Russian
economy in global value supply chains and its focus on production of raw
materials. However, 60% of Russia's imports come from the countries that have
imposed sanctions against it.

## Mergers and acquisitions

Between 1985 and 2018, almost 28,500 mergers or acquisitions have been
announced in Russia. This cumulates to an overall value of around USD 984
billion which translates to RUB 5.456 billion. In terms of value, 2007 has
been the most active year with USD 158 billion, whereas the number of deals
peaked in 2010 with 3,684 (964 compared to the value record year 2007). Since
2010 value and numbers have decreased constantly and another wave of M&A is
expected.

The majority of deals in, into or out of Russia have taken place in the
financial sector (29%), followed by banks (8.6%), oil and gas (7.8%), and
Metals and Mining (7.2%).

Here is a list of the top deals with Russian companies participating ranked by
deal value in million USD:
