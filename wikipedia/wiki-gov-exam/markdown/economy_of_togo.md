The **economy ofTogo** has struggled greatly. The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) ranks it as the tenth poorest country in the world, with development
undercut by political instability, lowered commodity prices, and external
debts. While industry and services play a role, the economy is dependent on
subsistence agriculture, with industrialization and regional banking suffering
major setbacks.

In January 2017, the IMF signed an Extended Credit Facility arrangement,
consisting of a three-year $238 million loan package. Progress depends on
follow through on privatization, increased transparency in government
financial operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued
support from foreign donors.

## Agriculture

The majority of the Togolese population depends on subsistence agriculture.
Its agricultural products includes coffee, cocoa, cotton, yams, cassava
(tapioca), corn, beans, rice, pearl millet, sorghum and livestock such as
fish. Food and cash crop production employs the majority of the labor force
and contributes about 42% to the gross domestic product (GDP). Coffee and
cocoa are traditionally the major cash crops for export, but cotton
cultivation increased rapidly in the 1990s, with 173,000 metric tons produced
in 1999.

After a disastrous harvest in 2001 (113,000 metric tons), cash crops
production rebounded to 168,000 metric tons in 2002. Despite insufficient
rainfall in some areas, the Togolese Government has achieved its goal of self-
sufficiency in food crops — maize, cassava, yams, sorghum, pearl millet, and
groundnut. Small and medium-sized farms produce most of the food crop; the
average farm size is one to three hectares.

Togo produced in 2018:

  * 1 million tons of cassava;
  * 886 thousand tons of maize;
  * 858 thousand tons of yam;
  * 277 thousand tons of sorghum;
  * 207 thousand tons of beans;
  * 156 thousand tons of palm oil;
  * 143 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 145 thousand tons of rice;
  * 127 thousand tons of cotton;
  * 43 thousand tons of peanut;
  * 41 thousand tons of cocoa;
  * 26 thousand tons of millet;
  * 26 thousand tons of banana;
  * 21 thousand tons of coffee;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

Choco Togo is the country's first bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer.

## Industry

### Mining

In the industrial sector, phosphates are Togo's most important commodity, and
the country has an estimated 60 million metric tons of phosphate reserves.
From a high point of 2.7 million tons in 1997, production dropped to
approximately 1.1 million tons in 2002. The fall in production is partly the
result of the depletion of easily accessible deposits and the lack of funds
for new investment. The formerly state-run company Société Nouvelle des
Phosphates du Togo (New Phosphate Company of Togo) appears to have benefited
from private management, which took over in 2001. Togo also has substantial
limestone and marble deposits.

Encouraged by the commodity boom of the mid-1970s, which resulted in a
fourfold increase in phosphate prices and sharply increased government
revenues, Togo embarked on an overly ambitious program of large investments in
infrastructure while pursuing industrialization and development of state
enterprises in manufacturing, textiles, and beverages. However, following
declines in world prices for commodities, its economy became burdened with
fiscal imbalances, heavy borrowing, and unprofitable state enterprises.

### Other

While Togo itself produces no crude oil, it is the namesake of an illegal
market for stolen oil off the Niger Delta, called the Togo Triangle.

## IMF relationship

Togo turned to the IMF for assistance in 1979, while simultaneously
implementing a stringent adjustment effort with the help of a series of IMF
standby programs, World Bank loans, and Paris Club debt rescheduling. Under
these programs, the Togolese Government introduced a series of austerity
measures and major restructuring goals for the state enterprise and rural
development sectors. These reforms were aimed at eliminating most state
monopolies, simplifying taxes and customs duties, curtailing public
employment, and privatizing major state enterprises. Togo made good progress
under the international financial institutions' programs in the late 1980s,
but movement on reforms ended with the onset of political instability in 1990.
With a new, elected government in place, Togo negotiated new 3-year programs
with the World Bank and IMF in 1994.

Togo returned to the Paris Club in 1995 and received Naples terms, the club's
most concessionary rates. With the economic downturn associated with Togo's
political problems, scheduled external debt service obligations for 1994 were
greater than 100% of projected government revenues (excluding bilateral and
multilateral assistance). By 2001, Togo was embarked on an IMF Staff Monitored
Program designed to restore macroeconomic stability and financial discipline
but without any new IMF resources pending new legislative elections. New IMF,
World Bank and Africa Development Bank (ADB) lending must await the
willingness of Togo's traditional donors – the European Union, principally,
but the US also – to resume aid flows. So far, Togo's problematic legislative
and presidential elections and the government's continued unwillingness to
transition from an Eyadéma-led autocracy to democracy have deterred these
donors from providing Togo with more aid. As of the fall 2002, Togo was $15
million in arrears to the World Bank and owed $3 million to the ADB.

Togo is one of 16 members of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS). The ECOWAS development fund is based in Lomé. Togo also is a member
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), which groups seven
West African countries using the CFA franc. The West African Development Bank
(BOAD), which is associated with UEMOA, is based in Lomé. Togo long served as
a regional banking center, but that position has been eroded by the political
instability and economic downturn of the early 1990s. Historically, France has
been Togo's principal trading partner, although other European Union countries
are important to Togo's economy. Total United States trade with Togo amounts
to about $16 million annually.

## Open Market

Trade is extremely important to Togo's economy; the combined value of exports
and imports equals 105 percent of GDP. The average applied tariff rate is 11.4
percent. Non-tariff barriers impede some trade. Government openness to foreign
investment is above average. Capital transactions are subject to some controls
or government approval. The evolving banking system continues to expand but
lacks liquidity.
