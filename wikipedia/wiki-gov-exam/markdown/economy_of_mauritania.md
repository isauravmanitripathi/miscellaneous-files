Mauritanian exports in 2006

The **economy of Mauritania** is still largely based on agriculture, mining
and livestock, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
were forced into the cities by recurring droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.

Train carrying iron ore.

Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of
total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to
cutbacks in production. With the current rise in metal prices, gold and copper
mining companies are opening mines in the interior.

The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world,
but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The
country's first deep water port opened near Nouakchott in 1986.

In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup
of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a
joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission on a $54 million enhanced
structural adjustment facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set
for 1999–2002. Privatization remains one of the key issues.

## Macro-economic trends

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Mauritania at market
prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions
of Mauritanian Ouguiyas.

---|---|---|---  
1980 | 37,211 | 45.93 Ouguiyas | 23   
1985 | 60,197 | 77.07 Ouguiyas | 36   
1990 | 97,819 | 80.64 Ouguiyas | 52   
1995 | 158,443 | 129.76 Ouguiyas | 73   
2000 | 258,245 | 240.00 Ouguiyas | 100   
2005 | 514,642 | 265.55 Ouguiyas | 144   
  
Current GDP per capita of Mauritania grew 82% in the Sixties reaching a peak
growth of 166% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable, and growth
consequently scaled back to 14% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 29% in
the Nineties. Mean wages were $0.97 per man-hour in 2009.

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1990–2024.

## Diversification

In 2007, mining industries accounted for well over 35 percent of the
Mauritanian economy, with the fish industry so much as 54% (with big changes
between these industries in the power relationship). Diversification of the
economy into non-mining industries remains a long-term issue. Mauritania is a
net importer of food, reportedly importing 70% of its domestic food needs.

## Natural Gas and the Tortue/Ahmeyim Project

In 2015, Kosmos Energy made significant natural gas discoveries on the
maritime border between Senegal and Mauritania, and in December 2016, it
entered into partnership with British Petroleum. The two companies, along with
Mauritanian and Senegalese governments and the two countries' national oil
companies, are optimistic about the potential of these gas discoveries. The
Grand Tortue/Ahmeyim reserves are estimated at 15 trillion cubic feet.
According to BP, 'that's equivalent to all of Africa's current gas production
for nearly seven years.' The production phase will begin in 2022, starting
with 2.3 million tons annually.

## Dispute with Woodside Petroleum

In February 2006, the new Mauritanian government denounced amendments to an
oil contract made by former Leader Ould Taya with Woodside Petroleum, an
Australian company. In 2004, Woodside had agreed to invest US$600 million in
developing Mauritania's Chinguetti offshore oil project. The controversial
amendments, which Mauritanian authorities declared had been signed "outside
the legal framework of normal practice, to the great detriment of our
country", could cost Mauritania up to $200 million a year, according to BBC
News. Signed by Woodside two weeks after the February 1, 2005, legislation
authorizing the four amendments, they provided for a lower state quota in the
_profit-oil_ , and reduced taxes by 15 percent in certain zones. They also
eased environmental constraints and extended the length and scope of the
exploitation and exploration monopoly, among other measures.

The disputed amendments were signed by former Oil Minister Zeidane Ould Hmeida
in February 2004 and March 2005. Hmeida was arrested in January 2006 on
charges of "serious crimes against the country's essential economic
interests".

Nouakchott's authorities declared that the government would likely seek
international arbitration, which Woodside (which operated for Hardman, BG
Group, Premier Oil, ROC Oil, Fusion, Petronas, Dana Petroleum, Energy Africa
and the Hydrocarbons Mauritanian Society) also contemplated.

Discovered in 2001, Chinguetti has proven reserves of about 120,000,000
barrels (19,000,000 m3) of oil. At the end of December 2005, authorities
estimated that in 2006, the oil profits would be 47 billion _ouguiyas_ (about
US$180 million) and represent a quarter of the state budget, according to
_RFI_.

Some U.S. oil companies are alleged to be playing a part in Mauritania's oil
related corruption.

## Electricity

Mauritania has 380 MW of generating capacity, of which 263 MW are fossil fuels
and 117 MW are renewable. Its sunny weather makes solar power highly
favorable, and eight plants totaling 16.6 MW were installed with the support
of Masdar in 2016.
