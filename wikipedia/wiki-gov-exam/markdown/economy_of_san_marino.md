The **economy ofSan Marino** is a developed free-market economy focused on
industries such as tourism, banking, and the manufacture of ceramics,
clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and wine. Taken
together, the manufacturing and financial sector make up more than half of the
national GDP. The primary sector contribution to the GDP of the country is
marginal, with the main agricultural products being wine and cheeses. In
addition, San Marino sells collectible postage stamps to philatelists.

## Overview

San Marino's per-capita GDP stands at almost $53,000 in 2023, placing the
country 17th in the world. Overall, the per capita level of output and
standard of living is comparable to the richest regions of Italy. Most of the
food, water, and other raw resources are imported from Italy, including also
the totality of electricity and natural gas. Taxes, especially on labor and
capital income, are generally much lower than in Italy, therefore, there are
extremely strict requirements to obtain citizenship.

Following the global recession of 2007–2008, San Marino's economy contracted
considerably, especially in the finance and banking sector. As a result, GDP
decreased by 40% between 2008 and 2019, and unemployment, which was
practically nonexistent until 2007, arose to around 5–8 % in the years
following the great recession. During the same period, banks' deposits
plummeted, going from almost 14 billion euros in 2008 to 5.2 billion. An
important liquidity crisis followed suit, also made worse by the absence of a
lender of last resort, as San Marino is not part of the European Union. As a
consequence of these events, several banks have been bailed-out by the
government, including Cassa di Risparmio, the main bank of the country. Still,
the banking system remains weak, with balance sheets that are impaired by Non-
Performing Loans, which amount to 114% of the country's GDP.

The country is shifting away from an economic model typical of tax havens,
reliant on banks and tax secrecy. Major steps in this direction were taken in
2010 with the abolition of anonymous companies and in 2017 with the abolition
of banking secrecy. Currently, San Marino actively cooperates with
international organizations, especially the Council of Europe and the European
Union, for what regards fighting against money laundering and terrorism
financing. As a result, San Marino was removed from the Italian blacklist of
tax havens in 2014, and from that of Ecofin in 2017.

## Public finances

In the years preceding the great recession, San Marino's public finances were
in very good shape, with a central government budget surplus and no national
debt. During the global downturn, the government adopted measures to dampen
the shock on the real economy and to bail out financial institutions, which
came at a high price for the soundness of public finances. The official
estimates place government debt at 32% of GDP in 2020, however, the actual
value is equal to 86% according to the International Monetary Fund, which
takes a broader view in considering government's liabilities.

While San Marino does not issue public debt securities that are traded on
financial markets, its creditworthiness is monitored by the rating agency
Fitch. The current rating of BB+ is the result of several downgrades that
occurred during and after the great recession: from AA to A in 2009 and to BBB
in 2016.

In the years following the Italian unification of 1861, several treaties were
signed between San Marino and the newborn Kingdom of Italy. The first such
treaty addressing economic issues was signed in 1865 for the introduction of
the Sammarinese lira, which was equivalent to the Italian lira and fully
recognized as a legal tender in both countries. Probably the most important
agreement is the convention of friendship and good neighborhood that was
signed in 1939, during fascism. This treaty establishes a customs union with
Italy and sets out some limitations on the carrying out of certain economic
activities, like tobacco cultivation, gambling, and radio broadcasting.

While San Marino is not part of the European Union, it had a customs union
with it since 1991, and there is an open border between the two areas. San
Marino also uses the Euro as its currency since 2000, when an agreement was
signed with Italy, on behalf of the EU. A new monetary convention was signed
in 2012 directly with the EU, covering a wider range of financial and monetary
issues. San Marino is also allowed to mint Sammarinese Euro coins, which are
printed by the Italian mint in Rome but feature a different national design
than Italian Euro coins. Since they are minted in a very limited amount, they
are rare and highly appreciated by coin collectors.

The main commercial partner of San Marino is Italy, with which around 88% of
exports and 78% of imports take place (2017). Other important partners are the
other countries of the EU, especially France and Germany.

## Companies

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in San
Marino is Retail Trade with 756 companies followed by Wholesale Trade and
Services with 753 and 752 companies respectively.

## Coins and stamps

One of the sources of income from tourism comes from the sale of historic
coins and stamps. In 1894, San Marino issued the first commemorative stamps
and since then that has been part of a large livelihood in the republic. All
10 of the Post Offices of San Marino sell these stamps and collectible coins,
including "Legal Gold Tender Coins".

Traditional economic activities in San Marino were food crops, sheep farming,
and stone quarrying. Today farming activities focus on grain, vines, and
orchards, as well as animal husbandry (cattle and swine).
