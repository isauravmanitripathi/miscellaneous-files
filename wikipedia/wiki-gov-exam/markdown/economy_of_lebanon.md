The **economy of Lebanon** has been experiencing a large-scale multi-
dimensional crisis since 2019, including a banking collapse, the Lebanese
liquidity crisis and a sovereign default. It is classified as a developing,
lower-middle income economy. The nominal GDP was estimated at $19 billion in
2020, with a per capita GDP amounting to $2,500. In 2018 government spending
amounted to $15.9 billion, or 83% of GDP.

The Lebanese economy went through a significant expansion after the 34-day war
of 2006, with growth averaging 9.1% between 2007 and 2010. After 2011 the
local economy was affected by the Syrian civil war, growing by a yearly
average of 1.7% on the 2011–2016 period and by 1.5% in 2017. In 2018, the size
of the GDP was estimated to be $54.1 billion. Between 2019 and 2021, the
economy shrank by 53.4%, the highest contraction in a list of 193 countries.
Since 2020, the International Monetary Fund no longer publishes data on the
Lebanese economy.

Lebanon is the third-highest indebted country in the world in terms of debt-
to-GDP ratio. As a consequence, interest payments consumed 48% of domestic
government revenues in 2016, thus limiting the government's ability to make
needed investments in infrastructure and other public goods.

The Lebanese economy is service-oriented. Lebanon has a strong tradition of
_laissez-faire_ , with the country's constitution stating that "the economic
system is free and ensures private initiative and the right to private
property". The major economic sectors include metal products, banking,
agriculture, chemicals, and transport equipment. The main growth sectors
include banking and tourism. There are no restrictions on foreign exchange or
capital movement.

A pedestrian-only street in Beirut's central district.

The 1975–1990 Lebanese Civil War seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
infrastructure, cut national output by half, and had major consequences for
Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. After the
war, the central government regained its ability to control key port and
government facilities. As a result, GDP per capita expanded 353% in the 1990s.
Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and
resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances,
banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the
main sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy has made impressive gains
since the launch of "Horizon 2000," the government's $20 billion
reconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and 7% in 1995 before
Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted economic activity.
Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of less than 3% per year for 1997 and
1998 and only 1% in 1999. During 1992–98, annual inflation fell from more than
100% to 5%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $6 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have generated foreign payments
surpluses, and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable. Progress
also has been made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial
infrastructure. Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of
Beirut's central business district; the stock market reopened in January 1996,
and international banks and insurance companies are returning. The government
nonetheless faces serious challenges in the economic arena. It has had to fund
reconstruction by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting borrowing.
Reducing the government budget deficit is a major goal of the current
government. The gap between rich and poor grew in the 1990s, resulting in
popular dissatisfaction over the skewed distribution of the reconstruction's
benefits and leading the government to shift its focus from rebuilding
infrastructure to improving living conditions.

After the end of the civil war, Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability,
Beirut's reconstruction was almost complete, and increasing numbers of
tourists poured into the nation's resorts. The economy witnessed growth, with
bank assets reaching over US$75 billion, Market capitalization was also at an
all-time high, estimated at $10.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of
2006. The month-long 2006 war severely damaged Lebanon's economy, especially
the tourism sector. Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure
mainly in the real estate and tourism sectors, resulting in a comparatively
robust post war economy. Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon
include Saudi Arabia (with US$1.5 billion pledged), the European Union (with
about $1 billion) and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of
up to $800 million.

Given the frequent security turmoil it has faced, the Lebanese banking system
has adopted a conservative approach, with strict regulations imposed by the
central bank to protect the economy from political instability. These
regulations have generally left Lebanese banks unscathed by the 2008 financial
crisis. Lebanese banks remain, under the current circumstances, high on
liquidity and reputed for their security. In late 2008, Moody's shifted
Lebanon's sovereign rankings from stable to positive, acknowledging its
financial security. Moreover, with an increase of 51% in the Beirut stock
market, the index provider MSCI ranked Lebanon the world's best performer in
2008. Lebanon is one of the only seven countries in the world in which the
value of the stock market increased in 2008. The Lebanese economy experienced
continued resilience, growing 8.5 percent in 2008, 7 percent in 2009 and 8.8%
in 2010. However, Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio remained one of the highest in
the world.

The Syrian crisis has significantly affected Lebanese economic and financial
situation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living
in Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct
consequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A
loss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also
been registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate
increased with 170,000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the
period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and
losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian
refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every
year.

The International Monetary Fund issued a second report on Lebanon in October
2015, where its expectations of the economic growth rate were lowered to 2%,
compared to the 2.5% growth rate of the first report, released in April 2015.

In October 2019, Lebanon witnessed nationwide protests that erupted over the
country's deteriorating economic conditions. Thousands of demonstrations took
to the streets of downtown Beirut, calling for the government of Prime
Minister Saad al-Hariri to quit over "its utter failure to stop the
deterioration of the economic and living conditions in the country". The
protests began after the government announced to charge 20 cents per day for
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) over social media apps, including
WhatsApp, Facebook, and other applications.

Lebanon has a very high level of public debt and large external financing
needs. The 2010 public debt exceeded 150.7% of GDP, ranking fourth highest in
the world as a percentage of GDP, though down from 154.8% in 2009. At the end
2008, finance minister Mohamad Chatah stated that the debt was going to reach
$47 billion in that year and would increase to $49 billion if privatization of
two telecoms companies did not occur. The Daily Star wrote that exorbitant
debt levels have "slowed down the economy and reduced the government's
spending on essential development projects".

During the early part of 2020, the central bank (BdL) defaulted on $90
sovereign debt obligations and the government needed recourse to the IMF for a
shortfall of $50 billion.

On 4 August 2020, the explosion of 2,750 tons ammonium nitrate in a Beirut
port warehouse caused the destruction of the "only large grain silo" in the
country, in addition to more than 200 people killed and several square
kilometres of pulverised buildings in the downtown core of the city. By 9
August, President of France Emmanuel Macron had counted over €250 million of
global contributions to the relief effort. On 10 August, the government of
Hassan Diab resigned. The day before, IMF director Kristalina Georgieva had
laid down four conditions for the co-operation of her organization:

  * restoring the financial solvency of the state,
  * cutting losses at state-owned companies,
  * passing a law to regulate capital outflows and
  * setting up a social safety net.

On 14 August, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (UNOCHA) launched a $565 million appeal for donors of aid to victims
of the explosions. The UN effort was to focus on: meals, first aid, shelters,
and repair of schools. Some of the money that Macron collected would be used
by the UNOCHA.

### 2019–present economic crisis

According to a World Bank report, Lebanon's economy which was structurally
strained before the Syrian shock suffered a real blow as an aftermath of the
Syrian crisis which brought around 1.5 million Syrian refugees into Lebanon.
The GDP growth rate declined by around 1 percent in 2018. In August 2019, the
USD parallel exchange rate started diverging from the official exchange rate;
the official exchange rate for the USD had been £L1,507.5 since 1997, while
the parallel exchange rate was £L1,600 in the fall of 2019 and would increase
to around £L4,200 in May 2020. The USD parallel exchange rate is increasing
because of the dollar shortage in Lebanon. In a bid to lower the dollar price,
the central bank made an agreement with the licensed exchangers to make the
official rates on offer at £L3,860/3,910. However, despite the central bank's
efforts, on 23 June 2020, the black market dollar reached a staggering rate of
£L 6,075 devaluing the Lebanese pound by 75%. This dollar shortage also caused
785 restaurants and cafes to close between September 2019 and February 2020
and caused 25,000 employees to lose their jobs. This economic crisis made
Lebanon's gross domestic product fall to about $44 billion, which was about
$55 billion the year before. The crisis became worse when the COVID-19
pandemic affected the Lebanese economy. In 2020, the country defaulted for the
first time on $30 billion in bonds and tried to seek help from the IMF but the
negotiations never reached fruition.

The liquidity crisis also lead to a restriction on the withdrawals from US
dollar bank accounts. Depositors needed to preserve the value of their
savings, especially following press reports about possible haircuts and
restructuring of the banking sector. They therefore turned to buying real
estate. For example, revenues from land sales of the major real estate
developer, Solidere company, soared from nearly $1.3 million to $234.5
million. Also, these depositors turned to buying shares in Solidere company,
which lead to a rise of 500% in its price between the start of the liquidity
crisis and April 2021.

The already battered economy of Lebanon suffered fresh blow with the port
blast on 4 August 2020. Economists have claimed that the blasts could result
in the contraction of Beirut's GDP by around 20–25% for the year. The current
figure surpasses IMF's last forecast of 12% crash in GDP because of the
ongoing and increasing economic and political crisis in Lebanon.

In March 2021, Lebanon approved an emergency assistance package from the World
Bank worth $246 million in order to support struggling families and strengthen
the social safety and try to face the economic crisis.

On March 16, as the Lebanese pound jumped on the black market from £L13,000 to
£L15,000 against the US dollar, protesters took to the streets, grocery stores
closed and bakeries threatened to close.

After the meeting of the President Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Saad
Hariri on March 18, the Lebanese pound dropped from £L15,000 against the
dollar on the black market to £L12,500.

As of 2023, Lebanon is considered by some to have become a failed state,
suffering from chronic poverty, economic mismanagement and a banking collapse.
Lebanon’s poverty rate have surged from 20 percent to over 80 percent after
2019, driven by economic crises worsened by the 2020 Beirut explosion and the
COVID-19 pandemic. These crises have intensified resource shortages and
deepened reliance on sectarian patronage systems that have further entrenched
societal divisions and accompanying political and economic stagnation.

#### Causes

##### External debt

After the civil war, the Lebanese government resorted to massive borrowing to
finance its post-war restructuring. The yearly growth of gross debt between
1993 and 1995 was 123 percent and between 1995 and 2000 was 171 percent.
Between 2005 and 2018, the yearly growth of debt has averaged around 22
percent, and in comparison the GDP growth rate for the same period has been in
single digits with an exception of 2009. This high debt has caused Lebanon to
spend a big chunk of its revenues in debt servicing; on average, close to 45
percent is spent by the government as interest payments. In 1996, interest
payments made up almost 68 percent of that year's budget deficit. With debt
piling up and growth being minuscule, Lebanon's debt to GDP ratio reached 178
percent by the end of 2019, which makes it the third most indebted country
after Greece and Japan. In 2020, Beirut defaulted on a $1.2 billion external
bond, the first sovereign default in its history. The nation is currently in
discussions with a group of creditors about a possible restructuring of a
defaulted Eurobond. A successful restructuring would allow the country to
again access external credit markets.

##### Currency crisis

Lebanon's national currency, the Lebanese pound is pegged to the US dollar at
£L15,000 to US$1. This fixed rate has been unstable due to the depreciating
value of the pound in the black market. According to reports, the pound was
trading at £L8,100 to US$1 in 2019 on the black market. The causes of the
pound's depreciation can be traced back to the economy's dependence on
imports. Lebanon in 2018 imported US$20 bn worth of goods and exported goods
worth only US$3 bn. This trade deficit also widened as the remittances share,
which was around 24 percent in 2008 declined to nearly 12 percent in 2018.
This coupled with geopolitical tensions of the region, caused the Pound-Dollar
peg rate to wither. As a response, the central bank resorted to more borrowing
and also issued a directive that required all money transfer offices to cash
out transfers in the local currency, further exacerbating the dollar crunch.

##### Corruption and political instability

After a devastating explosion in Beirut on 4 August 2020 that killed at least
200 people, the government, headed by Prime Minister Hassan Diab, announced
that his government was stepping down. In his speech, Mr. Diab said that
corruption cases were widespread in the country's political and administrative
landscape; other calamities hiding in many minds and warehouses, and which
pose a great threat, are protected by the class that controls the fate of the
country.

According to reports, the financial troubles and political inaction had caused
growing anger and frustration among people who began protesting in October
last year. Protesters demanded an end to corruption and the resignation of
political leaders including the then Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. This year,
the newly formed government under Diab faced the same accusations of
corruption. In November 2019, The central bank of Lebanon was accused of
running a Ponzi scheme as it relied on fresh borrowing to service its debt.
The bank denied the allegations stating that its action was in par with the
1963 Code of Money and Credit. Amidst the failing banking system, banks
resorted to putting informal curbs on dollar withdrawals and international
transfers, stirring mass protests and police violence. The pandemic brought
the protests to a halt for some time but the port explosion in Beirut once
again brought people to the streets, who, as reports state, have lost faith in
the political elite. Some estimates state that half of Lebanon's population is
living near or below the poverty line and thousands of people have lost their
jobs. There have been incessant power cuts and some residents have been
calling the blackouts worse than those witnessed in the 1975–1990 civil war.

## Trade

Lebanese exports in 2006 External trade (USD, million)

Lebanon's trade balance is structurally negative. In 2017, the trade deficit
reached $20.3 billion. The country imported $23.1 billion worth of goods and
services, and exported $2.8 billion.

Lebanon has a competitive and free market regime and a strong laissez-faire
commercial tradition. The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth
sectors include banking and tourism. There are no restrictions on foreign
exchange or capital movement.[_citation needed_]

### Food security

Food accounted for 18% of the dollar value of the imports to Lebanon in 2018,
according to World Bank statistics. Wheat and livestock are two foodstuffs for
which Lebanon is import-dependent. Around 90 percent of imported wheat is
sourced from Ukraine and Russia. The wheat reserves of Lebanon are kept in
silos at the Port of Beirut and cover about three months of consumption. In
2019, domestic wheat production measured 130,000 tons, while wheat imports
measured 570,000 tons.

The food security of Lebanon is a subject of debate. On the one hand,
administrators of the UNESCWA used the World Food Programme in May 2016 to
sell the story that the country imports up to 80% of its needs. On the other
hand, domestic audiences are told that the country is almost self-sufficient
in food:

> Overall, Lebanon is self-sufficient in the production of fruits, and almost
> self-sufficient with regards to the production of vegetables. Self-
> sufficiency indexes reach up to 200% for bananas, citrus, and apples.
> However, Lebanon has a significant deficit in the production of cereals,
> livestock, and dairy products. Lebanon had a deficit in cereal production at
> an average of 800 thousand tons per year prior to the Syrian Crisis. Half of
> the quantity of imported cereals is soft wheat. Lebanon implements a wheat
> subsidies instrument, through the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MET)... The
> implementation of wheat subsidies is left to a yearly decision undertaken by
> the Council of Ministers... MET also implements a bread price control, with
> prices of bread fixed at 1 USD per 900 grams of standard Lebanese bread.
> Through this policy, MET supports bakeries and mills by providing in-kind
> wheat flour deliveries to reduce production cost and ensure mills and
> bakeries still have a profit margin on the standard 900 gram bread package.

## Corruption

According to NGO Transparency International Lebanon ranks 138th out of 180
countries surveyed in the Corruption Perceptions Index. A poll conducted by
Transparency International in 2016 indicated that 92% of Lebanese thought that
corruption had increased that year. Additionally, 67% of the respondents
indicated that they believed that the majority of the political and economical
elites were corrupted, and 76% indicated that the government was doing poorly
when it came to fighting corruption.

As of July 2020, Riad Salamé, governor of Banque du Liban (the country's
central bank) since 1993, has had his assets frozen, and is facing an October
hearing accused of the embezzlement of central bank assets, and the
mismanagement of public funds.

The already suffering country was struck by a huge explosion on 4 August 2020.
The explosion devastated the Port of Beirut and destroyed many houses, leaving
almost 300,000 people homeless. This explosion has led to the demolition of
the country's main harbor that was used to import food.

## Inequality

The top 1% richest adults receive approximately a quarter of the total
national income, placing Lebanon among the most unequal countries in the
world. The bottom 50% of the population is left with 10% of total national
income.

Lebanon is characterized by a dual social structure, with an extremely rich
group at the top, whose income levels are comparable to their counterparts in
high-income countries, and a much poorer mass of the population, as in many
developing countries. This polarized structure reflects the absence of a broad
"middle class": While the middle 40% receives more than the share accruing to
the top 10% in Western Europe, and a bit less in the US, it is left with far
less income than the top 10% in Lebanon (between 20 and 30 p.p less). The
richest captured most of the income growth since 2005: The top 10% saw its
income increase by 5 to 15%, while the bottom 50% saw it decrease by 15% and
the poorest 10% by a quarter.

Lebanese billionaires' wealth represents on average, between 2005 and 2016,
20% of national income as opposed to 2% in China, 5% in France, and 10% in the
US.

## Fiscal haven

In 2018, Lebanon ranked 11th on the Financial Secrecy Index. Lebanon has a
strong history of banking secrecy but has taken steps to fight money
laundering and tax evasion in recent years. As of January 2019, banking
secrecy applies to Lebanese nationals living in Lebanon but is not applicable
to US citizens and US fiscal residents since the FATCA agreement was
introduced. Lebanon is part of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange
of Information for Tax Purposes and has signed an agreement to exchange fiscal
data with other countries, but as of January 2019, it is not compliant with
certain provisions of the treaty.

On the 24th of April 2025, a bill to amend the banking secrecy law was passed,
allowing all regulatory bodies and banking supervisory to request access to
all information.

Ali Hassan Khalil, Finance Minister, confirmed that 2019's draft budget showed
a deficit of less than 9% of GDP compared to 11.2% in 2018. Khalil also
claimed that the economic growth forecast of 1.5 percent could go up to 2% in
2019.

## Foreign investment

There are few restrictions on foreign investment, barring Israeli citizens and
entities. There are no country-wide U.S. trade sanctions against Lebanon,
although Hezbollah and individuals associated with it have been targeted by
the American government. Foreign ownership of real estate is legal under
certain conditions.

According to a report by _The Wall Street Journal_ , "Lebanon has one of the
world's highest public debt-to-gross domestic product ratios, rising to over
150% as it takes on more debt to plug budget holes." In January 2019, in a
move to boost the economy of Lebanon and help the country overcome its debts,
Qatar pledged to buy $500 million's worth of government bonds. In June 2019,
Bloomberg reported that Qatar had bought some of the bonds and planned to
complete the rest of the investment soon.

### Remittances

Lebanon benefits from its large, cohesive, and entrepreneurial diaspora. Over
the course of time, emigration has yielded Lebanese "commercial networks"
throughout the world. Consequently, in 2009, remittances from Lebanese abroad
to family members within the country totaled $8.2 billion and accounted for
one fifth of the country's economy. Nassib Ghobril, the head of research and
analysis for Byblos Bank, calculates that Lebanese abroad supply Lebanon with
about $1,400 per capita every year.

## Investment

The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Lebanon was valued at
$9.6 billion in January 2019, down from $11.5 billion in January 2018

Lebanon was unable to attract significant foreign aid to help it rebuild from
both the long civil war (1975–89) and the Israeli occupation of the south
(1978–2000). In addition, the delicate social balance and the near-
dissolution of central government institutions during the civil war
handicapped the state as it sought to capture revenues to fund the recovery
effort. Thus it accumulated significant debt, which by 2001 had reached $28
billion, or nearly 150% of GDP. Economic performance was sluggish in 2000 and
2001 (zero growth in 2000, and estimates between 1.0 and 1.4% in 2001, largely
attributed to slight increases in tourism, banking, industry, and
construction). Unemployment is estimated at 14% for 2000 and 29% among the
15-24-year age group, with preliminary estimates of further increases in 2001.
However, many Lebanese expatriates have been able to return to the country due
to the negative financial situations they are facing abroad, due to the global
economic crisis. Also, more job opportunities are attracting more Lebanese
youths for a chance to return and work in Lebanon, and also a benefit for the
Lebanese living in the country, graduating from universities.

Lebanon's current program of reforms focuses on three main pillars:

Lebanon has always been under constant political and social challenges because
of its location between the east and the west.

  * Economic revival and sustainable growth, with the private sector as the engine of growth;
  * Fiscal consolidation and structural improvement in public sector finances; and
  * Monetary, financial, and price stability.

The government also has maintained a firm commitment to the Lebanese pound,
which has been pegged to the dollar since September 1999. In late 2000, the
government substantially reduced customs duties, adopted export promotion
schemes for agriculture, decreased social security fees and restrictions on
investment in real estate by foreigners, and adopted an open-skies policy,
with positive effects on trade in 1991. Nonetheless, the relative appreciation
of the Lebanese currency has undermined competitiveness, with merchandise
exports falling from 23% of GDP in 1989 to 4% in 2000.

In 2001, the government turned its focus to fiscal measures, Increasing
gasoline taxes, reducing expenditures, and approving a value-added-tax that
became effective in February 2002. Slow money growth and dollarization of
deposits have hampered the ability of commercial banks to finance the
government, leaving more of the burden to the central bank. This monetization
of the fiscal deficit has put enormous pressure on central bank reserves,
mitigated only slightly with the issuance of new Eurobonds over the past 2
years. The central bank has maintained a stable currency by intervening
directly in the market, as well as low inflation, and succeeded in maintaining
investors' confidence in debt. It has done so at a cost, however, as
international reserves declined by $2.4 billion in 2000 and by $1.6 billion in
the first half of 2001.

For 2002, the government has put primary emphasis on privatization, initially
in the telecom sector and electricity, with continued planning for sales of
the state airline, Beirut port, and water utilities. The government has
pledged to apply the proceeds of sales to reducing the public debt and the
budget deficit. In addition, it projects that privatization will bring new
savings as government payrolls are pared, interest rates decline, and private
sector growth and foreign investment are stimulated. The government also is
tackling the daunting task of administrative reform, aiming to bring in
qualified technocrats to address ambitious economic programs, and reviewing
further savings that can be realized through reforms of the income tax system.
The Lebanese Government faces major challenges in order to meet the
requirements of a fiscal adjustment program focusing on tax reforms and
modernization, expenditure rationalization, privatization, and improved debt
management.

Faraya in Mount Lebanon Governorate. The Lebanese economy depends on its
tourism sector throughout all seasons of the year. Tourists from Europe, GCC,
and Arab countries visit Lebanon for various reasons.

The U.S. enjoys a strong exporter position with Lebanon, generally ranking as
Lebanon's fourth-largest source of imported goods. More than 160 offices
representing U.S. businesses currently operate in Lebanon. Since the lifting
of the passport restriction in 1997 (see below), a number of large U.S.
companies have opened branches or regional offices, including Microsoft,
American Airlines, Coca-Cola, FedEx, UPS, General Electric, Parsons
Brinckerhoff, Cisco Systems, Eli Lilly, Computer Associates and Pepsi Cola.

Solidere shares are the most actively traded in the Beirut Stock Exchange. Its
share price in the Beirut Stock Exchange has risen sharply in the last year
from around US$5.00 in early 2004 to close at US$17.50 on Friday, 23 December
2005.

In 2025, Lebanon amended its banking secrecy laws under pressure from the IMF.
The reforms would allow independent auditors access to banking records from
the past 10 years in an effort to stop corruption and facilitate a larger
restructuring of the Lebanese banking industry.

## Salaries of Lebanese

Marina Towers, Beirut

On 15 October 2011, after various unions, including the teachers' union, the
general worker's union and others threatened to strike, the minimum wage was
raised by 40% (£L200,000 - $133) to £L700,000 ($466). Most unions went ahead
with the strike except the general worker's union.

  * Wages between minimal wage and £L1,200,000 ($800) were increased by £L200,000 ($133) to become £L700,000 (minimal wage) and £L1,400,000 ($933) respectively.
  * Wages more than £L1,200,000 up to £L1,700,000 ($1,133) were increased by £L300,000 ($200) to become £L1,500,000 ($1,000) and £L2,000,000 ($1,333).
  * Wages above £L1,800,000 ($1,200) were not increased.

The increase in wages was welcomed by most Lebanese but it also sparked
criticism by some worker's unions, saying that the increases were not up to
expectations, especially that employees earning more than $1200 were not
entitled to raises. Others criticized the raises altogether citing that it
would burden small business that might end up closing altogether; those
critics were mainly opposition politicians.

As of 2013 World Bank analysis of Quality Life Index, it was estimated that:

  * 15% of the Lebanese people lives below the poverty line ($2,500)
  * 54% of the Lebanese people lives in the moderate middle class ($9,000) annually.  12% from 1998
  * 32% of the Lebanese people lives in the upper middle class ($15,000–27,000) annually.  19% from 1998
  * 7% of the Lebanese people lives in the highest upper class ($30,000 and above) annually  1% from 1998

## FATF analysis of Lebanon

In October 2024, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Lebanon on its
"grey list," designating it as a jurisdiction under increased monitoring due
to strategic deficiencies in countering money laundering and terrorist
financing.

### Background

Lebanon has faced a severe economic crisis since 2019, characterized by a
collapsing financial system, sovereign default, and escalating public debt.
The situation was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 Beirut
port explosion, leading to widespread poverty and infrastructure damage. In
March 2025, the World Bank estimated that Lebanon's recovery and
reconstruction needs amount to approximately $11 billion.

### FATF Grey Listing

The FATF's decision to grey-list Lebanon was influenced by several factors:

  * **Ineffective Judiciary** : Concerns over the independence and efficiency of Lebanon's judicial system in prosecuting financial crimes.
  * **Cash-Based Economy** : Following the collapse of its banking sector in 2019, Lebanon's increased reliance on cash transactions raised alarms about illicit financial flows.
  * **Terrorist Financing Risks** : The FATF highlighted that Lebanese authorities did not adequately address risks stemming from the activities of local paramilitary organizations.

### Implications

Being on the grey list subjects Lebanon to enhanced monitoring and may deter
foreign investment, complicate remittances, and increase compliance costs for
its financial institutions. The designation underscores the urgent need for
comprehensive reforms to strengthen Lebanon's anti-money laundering and
counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) framework.

### Government Response

In response to the grey listing, Lebanese authorities have committed to
implementing a detailed two-year action plan, concluding at the end of 2026,
to address the identified deficiencies and facilitate reassessment of
Lebanon's status by the FATF.

## 2025 government establishment

The European Union has stipulated that Lebanon must implement significant
financial reforms and secure an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) before it can receive the remaining €500 million of a previously pledged
€1 billion aid package. This condition was emphasized by EU Commissioner for
the Mediterranean, Dubravka Suica, during her recent visit to Lebanon, where
she highlighted the necessity of restructuring Lebanon's banking sector.
Despite a draft agreement with the IMF in 2022, Lebanon has yet to enact the
required reforms to access the associated funding. The newly formed
government, led by Finance Minister Yassine Jaber, has expressed a renewed
commitment to economic reform and plans to engage with the IMF, with a
delegation expected to visit in March to discuss the government's reform
agenda.

## 2025 IMF–World Bank Spring Meetings

In April 2025, a Lebanese delegation participated in the IMF–World Bank Spring
Meetings in Washington, D.C., where it presented a unified reform vision aimed
at addressing Lebanon’s protracted financial and economic crisis. The
delegation, led by Finance Minister Yassine Jaber, included the Minister of
Economy, the Governor of Banque du Liban, and senior presidential advisors.
This marked a notable shift from previous years, with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) positively noting the coherence and clarity in Lebanon’s
reform approach.

The delegation outlined a series of proposed reforms covering areas such as
tax policy, social security, economic restructuring, and monetary governance.
Banque du Liban Governor Karim A. Souaid emphasized the importance of
preserving the central bank’s independence and safeguarding the rights of
small depositors.

While IMF officials welcomed the renewed seriousness of the Lebanese side,
they reiterated that progress would depend on effective
implementation—something that had hindered past negotiations due to political
divisions and legislative inaction. Further discussions were held with IMF
Middle East and Central Asia Director Jihad Azour. In addition, Lebanon sought
support through a proposed $1 billion World Bank loan to assist in post-
conflict reconstruction and the establishment of a national social safety net.
According to the delegation, the reform proposals were internally driven and
framed as essential for the country's economic recovery and long-term
stability, rather than merely a response to external pressures.
