The **economy of Serbia** is a developing upper-middle income economy. Its
tertiary sector accounts for two-thirds of total gross domestic product (GDP).
Serbia's nominal GDP is estimated to reach $92 billion in 2025, with a GDP per
capita of $14,175. It's purchasing power parity (PPP) stood at $216.22
billion, which amounts to $33,115 per capita. Their capital city and financial
centre is Belgrade, with Novi Sad and Niš being important economic hubs. The
Belgrade Waterfront is adjacent to the National Bank of Serbia and the
Belgrade Stock Exchange.

Serbia has a significant industrial and manufacturing base, focused mainly on
machinery, automotive manufacturing, energy, and mining. Core exports of the
Serbian economy include automobiles, base metals, furniture, food processing,
machinery, chemicals, tires, clothes, and pharmaceuticals. Highly dependent on
international trade in Europe, key trading partners include its neighbors
around Central Europe as well as China and Russia.

## Historical preview

In the decades leading up to World War I, GDP growth in Serbia grew by 0.28%
per annum. This was a slower growth rate than Northwestern Europe, leading to
a widening economic divergence between Serbia and Western Europe. Prior to
WWI, there was extensive growth in Serbia's dominant agricultural sector.
However, industrial and service sectors remained small.

In the late 1980s, at the beginning of the process of economic transition from
a planned economy to a market economy, Serbia's economy had a favorable
position in comparison to most of the Eastern Bloc countries, but it was
gravely impacted by poor economic decision-making in the 1990s, the Yugoslav
Wars, and UN sanctions and trade embargo during the 1990s. At the same time,
the country experienced a serious "brain drain". There was a severe recession
which continued until 1999. After the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in 2000,
Serbia went through a process of transition to a market-based economy and
experienced sustained economic growth. During that period, the Serbian economy
grew 4-5% annually, average wages quadrupled, and economic and social
opportunities dramatically improved. During the Great Recession, Serbia marked
a decline in its economy of 3.1% in 2009, and following years of economic
stagnation pre-crisis level of GDP was reached only in 2016.

Since 2014, the country has been in the process of accession negotiations to
join the European Union.

## Macroeconomic trends

### Economic growth

The Serbian economy is expected to grow to $116 billion in 2029, slightly
outpacing the rest of the former Yugoslav Republics according to the IMF. It's
economy has been the largest former Yugoslav by purchasing power parity (PPP)
since 2008 and the second-largest by nominal GDP since 1998. Serbia's debt-to-
GDP ratio is currently at 41.7%, which is lower than the 60% level defined by
the Maastricht criteria as the upper limit of an acceptable level. It's
sovereign debt level is projected to be the second-lowest among the former
Yugoslav Republics by 2029, with an expected decrease from the current 49% to
46% of GDP. The average growth of Serbia's GDP from 2020 to 2025 was 4% per
year.

GDP structure by sector is: services 67.9%, industry 26.1%, agriculture 6.0%.

### Currency and inflation

1000 Serbian dinar banknote

The official currency in Serbia is the Serbian dinar and its earliest use
dates back to 1214.

Serbia historically has battled high inflation, especially during the 1980s
and 1990s. In 1992 and 1993, it experienced a period of hyperinflation which
lasted for a total of 25 months. In 1993, the monthly inflation rate stood at
a staggering 313 million percent. Since the early 2000s, the inflation rate
has stabilized and in the last couple of years a relatively low level of
inflation was recorded.

## Economic sectors

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Serbia
is Services with 125,511 companies followed by Wholesale Trade and
Manufacturing with 28,699 and 21,865 companies respectively.

### Agriculture

Map of motorways in Serbia. Vineyards in Fruška Gora; Serbia was the 11th
largest wine producer in Europe and 19th in the world in 2014.

Serbia has very favourable natural conditions (land and climate) for varied
agricultural production. It has 5,056,000 ha of agricultural land (0.7 ha per
capita), out of which 3,294,000 ha is arable land (0.45 ha per capita). In
2024, Serbia exported agricultural and food products worth $5.3 billion.
Agricultural exports constitute more than one-fifth of all Serbia's sales on
the world market. Serbia is one of the largest provider of frozen fruit to the
EU (largest to the French market, and second largest to the German market).
Agricultural production is most prominent in Vojvodina on the fertile
Pannonian Plain. Other agricultural regions include Mačva, Pomoravlje,
Tamnava, Rasina, and Jablanica. In the structure of the agricultural
production 70% is from the crop field production, and 30% is from the
livestock production. Serbia is world's second largest producer of plums
(582,485 tons; second to China) and the third largest of raspberries (127,010
tons, trailing only Russia and the United States). It is also significant
producer of maize (6.48 million tons, ranked 32nd in the world) and wheat
(2.07 million tons, ranked 35th in the world). Other important agricultural
products are: sunflower, sugar beet, soybean, potato, apple, mutton, pork
meat, beef, poultry and dairy.

There are 56,000 ha of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 230 million litres
of wine annually. Most famous viticulture regions are located in Vojvodina and
Šumadija.

### Energy

Đerdap 1 hydroelectric power station

The energy sector is one of the largest and most important sectors to the
country's economy. Serbia is a net exporter of electricity and importer of key
fuels (such as oil and gas).

Serbia has an abundance of coal, and significant reserves of oil and gas.
Serbia's proven reserves of 5.5 billion tons of coal lignite are the 5th
largest in the world (second in Europe, after Germany). Coal is found in two
large deposits: Kolubara (4 billion tons of reserves) and Kostolac (1.5
billion tons). Despite being small on a world scale, Serbia's oil and gas
resources (77.4 million tons of oil equivalent and 48.1 billion cubic meters,
respectively) have a certain regional importance since they are largest in the
region of former Yugoslavia as well as the Balkans (excluding Romania). Almost
90% of the discovered oil and gas are to be found in Banat and those oil and
gas fields are by size among the largest in the Pannonian basin but are
average on a European scale.

The production of electricity in 2018 in Serbia was 38.3 billion kilowatt-
hours (KWh), while the final electricity consumption amounted to 28.1 billion
kilowatt-hours (KWh). Most of the electricity produced comes from thermal-
power plants (71% of all electricity) and to a lesser degree from
hydroelectric-power plants (24%) and wind energy (3%). There are 6 lignite-
operated thermal-power plants with an installed power of 3,936 MW; largest of
which are 1,502 MW-Nikola Tesla 1 and 1,160 MW-Nikola Tesla 2, both in
Obrenovac. Total installed power of 9 hydroelectric-power plants is 2,831 MW,
largest of which is Đerdap 1 with capacity of 1,026 MW. In addition to this,
there are mazute and gas-operated thermal-power plants with an installed power
of 353 MW. The entire production of electricity is concentrated in
Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), public electric-utility power company.

The current oil production in Serbia amounts to over 1.1 million tons of oil
equivalent and satisfies some 43% of country's needs while the rest is
imported. National petrol company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), was
acquired in 2008 by Gazprom Neft. The company's refinery in Pančevo (capacity
of 4.8 million tons) is one of the most modern oil-refineries in Europe; it
also operates network of 334 filling stations in Serbia (74% of domestic
market) and additional 36 stations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 31 in Bulgaria,
and 28 in Romania. There are 155 kilometers of crude oil pipelines connecting
Pančevo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil
pipeline.

Serbia is heavily dependent on foreign sources of natural gas, with only 17%
coming from domestic production (totalling 491 million cubic meters in 2012)
and the rest is imported, mainly from Russia (via gas pipelines that run
through Ukraine and Hungary). Srbijagas, public company, operates the natural
gas transportation system which comprise 3,177 kilometers of trunk and
regional natural gas pipelines and a 450 million cubic meter underground gas
storage facility at Banatski Dvor.

### Industry

The industry is the economy sector that was the hardest hit by the UN
sanctions and trade embargo and NATO bombing during the 1990s and transition
to market economy during the 2000s. The industrial output saw dramatic
downsizing: in 2013 it was expected to be only a half of that of 1989. Main
industrial sectors include: automotive, mining, non-ferrous metals, food-
processing, electronics, pharmaceuticals, clothes. Serbia has 14 free economic
zones as of September 2017, in which many foreign direct investments are
realized.

Automotive industry (with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as a forebearer) is
dominated by cluster located in Kragujevac and its vicinity, and contributes
to export with about $2 billion. Country is a leading steel producer in the
wider region of South Central Europe and had production of nearly 2 million
tons of raw steel in 2018, coming entirely from Smederevo steel mill, owned by
the Chinese Hesteel.

Serbia notably manufactures intel smartphones named Tesla smartphones.

Food industry is well known both regionally and internationally and is one of
the strong points of the economy. Some of the international brand-names
established production in Serbia: PepsiCo and Nestlé in food-processing
sector; Coca-Cola (Belgrade), Heineken (Novi Sad) and Carlsberg (Bačka
Palanka) in beverage industry; Nordzucker in sugar industry. Serbia's
electronics industry had its peak in the 1980s and the industry today is only
a third of what it was back then, but has witnessed a something of revival in
last decade with investments of companies such as Siemens (wind turbines) in
Subotica, Panasonic (lighting devices) in Svilajnac, and Gorenje (electrical
home appliances) in Valjevo. The pharmaceutical industry in Serbia comprises a
dozen manufacturers of generic drugs, of which Hemofarm in Vršac and Galenika
in Belgrade, account for 80% of production volume. Domestic production meets
over 60% of the local demand.

#### Mining

Serbia's mining industry is comparatively strong: Serbia is the 18th largest
producer of coal (7th in Europe) extracted from large deposits in Kolubara and
Kostolac basins; it is also world's 23rd largest (3rd in Europe) producer of
copper which is extracted by Zijin Bor Copper, a large copper mining company,
acquired by Chinese Zijin Mining in 2018; significant gold extraction is
developed around Majdanpek.

### Telecommunications and IT industry

Fixed telephone lines connect 89% of households in Serbia, and with about 8.82
million users the number of cellphones surpasses the total population of
Serbia by 25%. The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija with 4.06 million
subscribers, followed by Yettel Serbia with 2.73 million users and A1 Srbija
with about 2.03 million. Some 58% of households have fixed-line (non-mobile)
broadband Internet connection while 67% are provided with pay television
services (i.e. 38% cable television, 17% IPTV, and 10% satellite). Digital
television transition has been completed in 2015 with DVB-T2 standard for
signal transmission.

The Serbian IT industry is rapidly growing and changing pace. In 2018, IT
services exports reached $1.3 billion. With 6,924 companies in the IT sector
(2013 data[update]), Belgrade is one of the information technology centers in
this part of Europe, with strong growth. Microsoft Development Center located
in Belgrade was at the time of its establishment fifth such center in the
world. Many world IT companies choose Belgrade as regional or European center
such as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, NCR, Ubisoft, etc. These companies have
taken advantage of Serbia's large pool of engineers and relatively low wages.

Large investments by global tech companies, such as Microsoft, typical of the
2000s, are being eclipsed by a growing number of domestic startups which
obtain funding from domestic and international investors. What brought
companies like Microsoft in the first place was a large pool of talented
engineers and mathematicians. In just the first quarter of 2016, more than
US$65 million has been raised by Serbian startups including $45 million for
Seven Bridges (a Bioinformatics firm) and $14 million for Vast (a data
analysis firm). One of the most successful startups have been Nordeus, which
was founded in Belgrade in 2010, and is one of Europe's fastest-growing
companies in the field of video games (the developer of Top Eleven Football
Manager; a game played by over 20 million people).

### Tourism

The touristic sector accounted for 1.4% of GDP in 2017 and employs some 75,000
people, about 3% of the country's workforce. Foreign exchange earnings from
tourism in 2018 were estimated at $1.5 billion.

Serbia is not a mass-tourism destination but nevertheless has a diverse range
of touristic products. In 2018, total of over 3.4 million tourists were
recorded in accommodations, of which half were foreign.

Tourism is mainly focused on the mountains and spas of the country, which are
mostly visited by domestic tourists, as well as Belgrade which is preferred
choice of foreign tourists. The most famous mountain resorts are Kopaonik,
Stara Planina, and Zlatibor. There are also many spas in Serbia, the biggest
of which is Vrnjačka Banja, Soko Banja, and Banja Koviljača. City-break and
conference tourism is developed in Belgrade (which was visited by 938,448
foreign tourists in 2018, more than a half of all international visits to the
country) and to a lesser degree Novi Sad. Other touristic products that Serbia
offer are natural wonders like Đavolja varoš, Christian pilgrimage to the many
Orthodox monasteries across the country and the river cruising along the
Danube. There are several internationally popular music festivals held in
Serbia, such as EXIT (with 25–30,000 foreign visitors coming from 60
countries) and the Guča trumpet festival.

### Transport

Serbia has a strategic transportation location since the country's backbone,
Morava Valley, represents by far the easiest route of land travel from
continental Europe to Asia Minor and the Near East.

Serbian road network carries the bulk of traffic in the country. Total length
of roads is 45,419 km of which 915 km are "class-Ia state roads" (i.e.
motorways); 4,481 km are "class-Ib state roads" (national roads); 10,941 km
are "class-II state roads" (regional roads) and 23,780 km are "municipal
roads". The road network, except for the most of class-Ia roads, are of
comparatively high quality to the Western European standards because of huge
financial investments Serbias has been seeing in the last 10 years.

Over 300 kilometers of new motorways has been constructed in the last decade
and additional 142 kilometers are currently under construction: A5 motorway
(from north of Kruševac to Čačak) and 30 km-long segment of A2 (between Čačak
and Požega). Coach transport is very extensive: almost every place in the
country is connected by bus, from largest cities to the villages; in addition
there are international routes (mainly to countries of Western Europe with
small Serb diaspora). Routes, both domestic and international, are served by
more than 100 bus companies, biggest of which are Lasta and Niš-Ekspres. As of
2018[update], there were 1,959,584 registered passenger cars or 1 passenger
car per 3.5 inhabitants.

Serbia has 3,819 kilometers of rail tracks, of which 1,279 are electrified and
283 kilometers are double-track railroad. The major rail hub is Belgrade (and
to a lesser degree Niš), while the most important railroads include:
Belgrade–Bar (Montenegro), Belgrade–Šid–Zagreb (Croatia)/Belgrade–Niš–Sofia
(Bulgaria) (part of Pan-European Corridor X), Belgrade–Subotica–Budapest
(Hungary) and Niš–Thessaloniki (Greece). Although still a major mode of
freight transportation, railroads face increasing problems with the
maintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds. The rail services are
operated by Srbija Voz (passenger transport) and Srbija Kargo (freight
transport).

There are three airports with regular passenger traffic. Belgrade Nikola Tesla
Airport served 5.6 million passengers in 2018 and is a hub of flagship carrier
Air Serbia which carried some 2.5 million passengers in 2018. Niš Constantine
the Great Airport is mainly catering low-cost airlines. Morava Airport is
currently only served by Air Serbia.

Serbia has a developed inland water transport since there are 1,716 kilometers
of navigable inland waterways (1,043 km of navigable rivers and 673 km of
navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the
country. The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-
European Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and
Timiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe
through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Central Europe via
the Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the
Sava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian
rivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad,
Belgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac.

## Labour

In 2021, the labour force was estimated at 3.201 million and employment stood
at 2.848 million persons (formal employment amounted to 2.473 million while
informal was at 0.375 million). Employment rate (among population aged 15 and
over) is comparatively low and stood at 48.6%; of those employed; of those
employed 15.9 worked in agriculture, 28.1% in industry, and 56% in services in
2018. The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-
socialist era, reaching its peak at 25.9% in 2012. Since then, the rate has
decreased substantially, with the creation of new jobs in primarily private
sector, reaching 9.8% in 2021.

According to the latest monthly report of the Statistical Office of the
Republic of Serbia, the average monthly salary in January 2022 amounted to
120,085 Serbian dinars (1,022 euros) gross or 85,422 Serbian dinars (727
euros) net. The median salary amounted to 85,422 Serbian dinars (727 euros)
gross or 64,860 (552 euros) net, which means that 50% of the employees had
earned a salary up to that amount.

The employer is also liable to pay for additional social security
contributions which brings the total labour cost for the average salary to
150,107 Serbian dinars (1,280 euros), thus the total tax ratio amounts to
26.9%. The map below shows average salaries by region in December 2022,
expressed in gross terms in order to make the data comparable to the data that
is published by Eurostat. Due to the nature of Serbia's economy, the majority
of people working in Serbia work under the so-called "entrepreneurship"
salary. This category of worker is seen in local markets, for examples,
plumbers, and a variety of occupations. The majority of people working in the
IT are also entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs' tax contribution will not exceed
the maximum amount of 10% of their salary. The average tax contribution is
from €80 to €250 a month (depending on the location registered in Serbia),
which is between 0.0042% to 2% of tax when compared to the max amount of
income allowed under the entrepreneurship bracket. This makes Serbia one of
the best countries for entrepreneurship in Europe, with lowest income tax rate
in Europe.
