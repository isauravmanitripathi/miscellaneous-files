The **economy of Guinea-Bissau** comprises a mixture of state-owned and
private companies. Guinea-Bissau is among the world's least developed nations
and one of the 10 poorest countries in the world, and depends mainly on
agriculture and fishing. Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent
years, and the country ranked ninth in cashew production for the year 2019.

Guinea-Bissau exports to Asia non-fillet frozen fish and seafood, peanuts,
palm kernels, and timber. License fees for fishing in their sea-zone (Gulf of
Guinea) provide the government with some small revenue. Rice is the major crop
and staple food. Due to European regulations, fish and cashew-nuts exports to
Europe are totally prohibited as well as agriculture products in general.

## Economic history

### Early colonialism

The flag of the Guinea Company, a Portuguese company that traded in several
commodities and slaves around the Guinea coast from the 15th century.

From a European viewpoint, the economic history of the Guinea Coast is largely
associated with slavery. Indeed, one of the alternative names for the region
was the Slave Coast. When the Portuguese first sailed down the Atlantic coast
of Africa in the 1430s, they were interested in gold. Ever since Mansa Musa,
king of the Mali Empire, made his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1325, with 500 slaves
and 100 camels (each carrying gold) the region had become synonymous with such
wealth. The trade from sub-Saharan Africa was controlled by the Islamic Empire
which stretched along Africa's northern coast. Muslim trade routes across the
Sahara, which had existed for centuries, involved salt, kola, textiles, fish,
grain and slaves.

As the Portuguese extended their influence around the coast, Mauritania,
Senegambia (by 1445) and Guinea, they created trading posts. Rather than
becoming direct competitors to the Muslim merchants, the expanding market
opportunities in Europe and the Mediterranean resulted in increased trade
across the Sahara. In addition, the Portuguese merchants gained access to the
interior via the Sénégal and Gambia rivers which bisected long-standing trans-
Saharan routes.

The Portuguese brought in copper ware, cloth, tools, wine and horses. Trade
goods soon also included arms and ammunition. In exchange, the Portuguese
received gold (transported from mines of the Akan deposits), pepper (a trade
which lasted until Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498) and ivory.

There was a very small market for African slaves as domestic workers in
Europe, and as workers on the sugar plantations of the Mediterranean. The
Portuguese found they could make considerable amounts of gold transporting
slaves from one trading post to another, along the Atlantic coast of Africa.
Muslim merchants had a high demand for slaves, which were used as porters on
the trans-Saharan routes, and for sale in the Islamic Empire. The Portuguese
found Muslim merchants entrenched along the African coast as far as the Bight
of Benin.

Before the arrival of the Europeans, the African slave trade, centuries old in
Africa, was not yet the major feature of the coastal economy of Guinea. The
expansion of trade occurs after the Portuguese reach this region in 1446,
bringing great wealth to several local slave trading tribes. The Portuguese
used slave labour to colonize and develop the previously uninhabited Cape
Verde islands where they founded settlements and grew cotton and indigo. They
then traded these goods, in the estuary of the Geba River, for black slaves
captured by other black peoples in local African wars and raids.

The slaves were sold in Europe and, from the 16th century, in the Americas.
The Company of Guinea was a Portuguese governative institution whose task was
to deal with the spices and to fix the prices of the goods. It was called
_Casa da Guiné_ , _Casa da Guiné e Mina_ from 1482 to 1483 and _Casa da Índia
e da Guiné_ in 1499. The local African rulers in Guinea, who prosper greatly
from the slave trade, have no interest in allowing the Europeans any further
inland than the fortified coastal settlements where the trading takes place.
The Portuguese presence in Guinea was therefore largely limited to the port of
Bissau.

### Colonial era

As with the other Portuguese territories in mainland Africa (Portuguese Angola
and Portuguese Mozambique), Portugal exercised control over the coastal areas
of Portuguese Guinea when first laying claim to the whole region as a colony.
For three decades there are costly and continuous campaigns to suppress the
local African rulers. By 1915 this process was complete, enabling Portuguese
colonial rule to progress in a relatively unruffled state - until the
emergence of nationalist movements all over Africa in the 1950s.

For a brief period in the 1790s the British attempted to establish a rival
foothold on an offshore island, at Bolama, but by the 19th century the
Portuguese were sufficiently secure in Bissau to regard the neighbouring
coastline as their own special territory. It was therefore natural for
Portugal to lay claim to this region, soon to be known as Portuguese Guinea,
when the European scramble for Africa began in the 1880s. Britain's interest
in the region declined since the end of the British slave trade in 1807. After
the abolition of slavery in the Portuguese overseas territories in the 1830s,
the slave trade went into serious decline.

Portugal's main rivals were the French, their colonial neighbours along the
coast on both sides - in Senegal and in the region which became French Guinea.
The Portuguese presence in Guinea was not disputed by the French. The only
point at issue was the precise line of the borders. This was established by
agreement between the two colonial powers in two series of negotiations, in
1886 and 1902–5. Until the end of the 19th century, rubber was the main
export.

### As an overseas province

In 1951, when the Portuguese government overhauled the entire colonial system,
all Portugal's colonies, including Portuguese Guinea, were renamed Overseas
Provinces (_Províncias Ultramarinas_). New infrastructures were built for
education, health, agriculture, transportation, commerce, services, and
administration.

Cashew, peanut, rice, timber, livestock and fish were the main economic
productions. The port of Bissau was one of the main employers and a very
important source of taxes for the province's authorities.

#### Independence war

The fight for independence began in 1956, when Amílcar Cabral founded the
_Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde_ (Portuguese:
_African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde_), the PAIGC. In
1961, when a purely political campaign for independence had made predictably
little progress, the PAIGC adopted guerrilla tactics. Although heavily
outnumbered by Portuguese troops (approximately 30,000 Portuguese to some
10,000 guerrillas), the PAIGe had the great advantage of safe havens over the
border in Senegal and Guinea, both recently independent of French rule.

Several communist countries supported the guerrillas with weapons and military
training. The conflict in Portuguese Guinea involving the PAIGC guerrillas and
the Portuguese Army was the most intense and damaging of all Portuguese
Colonial War. Thus, during the 1960s and early 1970s, Portuguese development
plans promoting strong economic growth and effective socioeconomic policies,
like those applied by the Portuguese in the other two theaters of war
(Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique), were not possible. In 1972
Cabral set up a government in exile in Conakry, the capital of neighbouring
Guinea. It was there, in 1973, that he was assassinated outside his house -
just a year before a left-wing military coup in Portugal dramatically altered
the political situation.

By 1973 the PAIGC controlled most of the interior of the country, while the
coastal and estuary towns, including the main population and economic centres,
remained under Portuguese control. The village of Madina do Boé in the
southeasternmost area of the territory, close to the border with neighbouring
Guinea, was the location where PAIGC guerrillas declared the independence of
Guinea-Bissau on September 24, 1973. The war in the colonies was increasingly
unpopular in Portugal itself, as the people got weary of war and balked at its
ever-rising expense. Following the coup d'état in Portugal in 1974, the new
left-wing revolutionary government of Portugal began to negotiate with the
PAIGC and decided to offer independence to all the overseas territories.

### After independence

As his brother Amílcar Cabral had been assassinated in 1973, Luís Cabral
became the first president of independent Guinea-Bissau in the time after
independence was granted on September 10, 1974. Already as the President of
Guinea-Bissau, Luís Cabral tried to impose a planned economy in the country,
and supported a socialist model that left the economy of Guinea-Bissau itself
ruined. Similarly, the repression imposed on the population by his
authoritarian single-party regime, and severe food shortages, also left marks.

Luís Cabral served from 1974 to 1980, when a military _coup d'état_ led by
João Bernardo "Nino" Vieira deposed him. Despite having always denied it, Luís
Cabral was accused of being responsible for the death of a large number of
black Guinea-Bissauan soldiers who had fought along with the Portuguese Army
against the PAIGC guerrillas during the Portuguese Colonial War. After the
military coup, in 1980 PAIGC admitted in its official newspaper "Nó Pintcha"
(dated November 29, 1980) that many were executed and buried in unmarked
collective graves in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole and Mansabá. All these
events did not help the new country to reach the level of prosperity, economic
growth and development the new rulers had promised to its population.

In 1985 the first Chinese oversees fishing fleet to go abroad was sent to
Guinea-Bissau, 13 trawlers from the China National Fisheries Corporation.

In May 1997 Guinea-Bissau joined the francophone West African Monetary Union.
Consequently, National Bank of Guinea-Bissau was converted as a national
branch of Central Bank of West African States, and the national currency
Guinea Bissau peso was replaced by West African CFA franc.

## Present day

### Macro-economic trend

Following the April 2012 coup d'État growth plunged to reach -1.5% of GDP. In
2013, the country's GDP grew only by 0.9%. This low growth level during a
period of democratic transition is explained by a combination of low
administrative efficiency, low investments on account of the political
instability and a bad cashew export season. Key macroeconomic indicators
estimated by the African Development Bank are presented in the chart below:

Real GDP growth  | 2013  | 2014 (estimate)  | 2015 (projection)  | 2016 (projection)   
---|---|---|---|---  
Real GDP per capita growth  | 0.9  | 2.6  | 3.9  | 3.7   
Real GDP per capita growth  | -1.5  | 0.2  | 1.6  | 1.3   
Budget balance % GDP  | -1.4  | -2.1  | -3.9  | -3.4   
Current account balance % GDP  | -4.1  | -0.5  | -0.8  | -1.2   
  
Intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops and a
military junta destroyed much of the country's infrastructure and caused
widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in
GDP that year, with partial recovery in 1999. Agricultural production is
estimated to have fallen by 17% during the conflict. Cashew nut output, the
main export crop, declined in 1998 by an estimated 30%. World cashew prices
dropped by more than 50% in 2000, compounding the economic devastation caused
by the conflict.

Before the war, trade reform and price liberalization were the most successful
part of the country's structural adjustment program under IMF sponsorship. The
tightening of monetary policy and the development of the private sector had
also begun to reinvigorate the economy. Under the government's post-conflict
economic and financial program, implemented with IMF and World Bank input,
real GDP recovered in 1999 by almost 8%. In December 2000 Guinea-Bissau
qualified for almost $800 million in debt-service relief under the first phase
of the enhanced HIPC initiative and is scheduled to submit its Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper in March 2002. Guinea-Bissau will receive the bulk of
its assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative when it satisfies a number
of conditions, including implementation of its Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper.

Because of high costs, the development of petroleum, phosphate, and other
mineral resources is not a near-term prospect. The country produces 400,000
barrels/day of petrol.

Mean wages were $0.52 per man-hour in 2009. In 2019 the minimal monthly wage
was around 35000 CFA = US$60.

### Financial sector

The financial sector of Guinea-Bissau is relatively underdeveloped: in 2013,
financial intermediation accounted for 4% of GDP, banking penetration is below
1% of the population (IMF 2013. Article IV Consultations – Guinea-Bissau, IMF
Country Report No 13/197) and access to finance is cited as the second most
important constraint for businesses. As of 2015, only four banks were
operating in the country. According to the IMF, regional private foreign banks
held about 65% of shares in the Bissau-Guinean banking system (IMF 2013).
Banks are regulated by the WAEMU authorities. In the aftermath of the civil
war (1998/1999), private sector credit had fallen below 1% of GDP. In 2003 the
balance sheets of banks amounted to EUR 21.3 million. Since then credit to the
economy has risen to nearly 13.8% of GDP.

### "Terra Ranka" (A fresh start): a new economic plan

On March 25, 2015, the Government of Guinea-Bissau convened an international
donor conference in Brussels. Hosted by the European Union with support from
the UNDP and other partners including the African Development Bank and the
World Bank, the country's major partners joined in welcoming the country's new
vision up to 2025, and to put pledges forth for its strategic and operational
plan dubbed "Terra Ranka" (A fresh start). Pledges totalled EUR 1.3 billion.

The strategic and operational plan is composed of six pillars: (i) peace and
governance, (ii) infrastructure, (iii) industrialisation, (iv) urban
development, (v) human development and (vi) biodiversity. Each of the pillars
is composed of a series of structuring projects to be financed either through
direct donor support or through the mobilisation of private funding.

## Income from waste dumping

In the 1980s Guinea-Bissau was part of a trend in the African continent toward
the dumping of waste as a source of income. Plans to import toxic waste from
Europe were cancelled after an international campaign to halt the trade. The
government was offered a contract to dispose of 15 million tons of toxic waste
over a 15-year period. The income from it was equivalent to twice the value of
its external debt. After strong pressure from other African countries and
environmental groups the Guinea-Bissau government renounced the deal.

## Drug trafficking

Over the last decade European consumption of cocaine is believed to have
tripled, and West Africa has become a primary transit point for trafficking
the drug from Colombia to Europe. Guinea-Bissau is the leading West African
country in this regard, with smugglers taking advantage of government
corruption and disorder to operate unimpeded. The army and police are alleged
to be complicit, and a lack of boats or planes to patrol or control the vast
sea-zone further brings them to turn a blind eye to cocaine shipments from
Latin America. The local population does not have access to the drug. Planes
fly in, and use Guinea-Bissau's 88 remote islands, the majority of which are
uninhabited.

## Energy

As of 2019, only 28% of the total population had access to electricity, with
only 7% of rural population and 56% of urban population having access to
electricity.

In 2016, 99% of electricity generation capacity came from fossil sources and
1% from renewable sources.
