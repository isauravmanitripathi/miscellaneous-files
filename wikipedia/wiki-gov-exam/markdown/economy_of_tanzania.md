The **economy of Tanzania** is a lower-middle income economy that is centered
around Manufacturing, Tourism, Agriculture, and financial services. Tanzania's
economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy
since 1985. Although the total GDP has increased since these reforms began,
GDP per capita dropped sharply at first, and only exceeded the pre-transition
figure in around 2007.

Following the rebasing of the economy in 2014, the GDP increased by a third to
$58.1 billion.

In 2020, the real GDP of Tanzania grew by 4.8% reaching US$89.5 billion versus
US$82.9 billion in 2019. This growth made it the 2nd largest economy in East
Africa after Kenya, and the 7th largest in Sub-Saharan Africa.

It has sustained relatively high economic growth compared to global trends, as
is characteristic of African nations. According to World Bank data, the last 5
years have seen the slowest growth since 2000. The medium-term outlook is so
far positive, with growth projected at 6 percent in 2020/21, which is
supported by large infrastructure spending.

The World Bank (WB) expects the economic growth of Tanzania to slow to 2.5% in
2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected the labor market, the
production capacity, and productivity. Tourism has halted, and exports of
manufacturing and agricultural goods slumped.

On 7 September 2021, the IMF approved US$567.25 million in emergency financial
assistance to support Tanzania’s efforts in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic by addressing the urgent health, humanitarian, and economic costs.

The IMF projects a GDP growth for Tanzania of +4.0% and +5.1% in 2021 and
2022, and 6.0% in 2026.

According to the World Bank, the GDP of Tanzania expanded by 4.6% in 2022, up
from 4.3% in 2021.

The value of Tanzania's GDP at current prices reached USD 105.1 billion in
2022.

The World Bank projects Tanzania's GDP growth to reach 5.1% in 2023.

## History

Significant measures have been taken to liberalize the Tanzanian economy along
market lines and encourage both foreign and domestic private investment.
Beginning in 1986, the Government of Tanzania embarked on an adjustment
program to dismantle the socialist (Ujamaa) economic controls and encourage
more active participation of the private sector in the economy. The program
included a comprehensive package of policies which reduced the budget deficit
and improved monetary control, substantially depreciated the overvalued
exchange rate, liberalized the trade regime, removed most price controls,
eased restrictions on the marketing of food crops, freed interest rates, and
initiated a restructuring of the financial sector. Tanzania accepted austerity
measures required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank-
imposed structural adjustment policies.

Current GDP per capita of Tanzania grew more than 40 percent between 1998 and
2007. In May 2009, the IMF approved an Exogenous Shock Facility for Tanzania
to help the country cope with the global economic crisis Tanzania is also
engaged in a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) with the IMF, which commenced in
February 2007 after Tanzania completed its second three-year Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), the first having been completed in August 2003.
The PRGF was the successor program to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility, which Tanzania also participated in from 1996 to 1999. The IMF's PSI
program provides policy support and signaling to participating low-income
countries and is intended for countries that have usually achieved a
reasonable growth performance, low underlying inflation, an adequate level of
official international reserves, and have begun to establish external and net
domestic debt sustainability.

Tanzania also embarked on a major restructuring of state-owned enterprises.
The program has so far divested 335 out of some 425 parastatal entities.
Overall, real economic growth has averaged about 4 percent a year, much better
than the previous 20 years, but not enough to improve the lives of average
Tanzanians. Also, the economy remains overwhelmingly donor-dependent.
Moreover, Tanzania has an external debt of $7.9 billion. The servicing of this
debt absorbs about 40 percent of total government expenditures. Tanzania has
qualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative. Debts worth over $6 billion were canceled following
implementation of the Paris Club 7 Agreement.

## Agriculture

Farmers clearing a rice field manually

The Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture, which accounts for 28.7
percent of gross domestic product, provides 85 percent of exports, and
accounts for half of the employed workforce; The agricultural sector grew 4.3
percent in 2012, less than half of the Millennium Development Goal target of
10.8 percent. 16.4 percent of the land is arable, with 2.4 percent of the land
planted with permanent crops.

This strong dependence on agriculture, makes Tanzania's economy highly
vulnerable to weather shocks and fluctuating commodity prices. 76% of
Tanzania's population subsist thanks to agriculture and, due to the lack of
knowledge and infrastructure to develop and implement some kind of
agricultural technology, any droughts, floods, or temperature shocks can
severely damage the living standards of those people and create huge increases
in unemployment, hunger, and malnutrition rates, as well as, in really severe
case, mortality rates due to starvation.

Tanzania produced in 2018:

  * 5.9 million tons of maize;
  * 5 million tons of cassava (12th largest producer in the world);
  * 3.8 million tons of sweet potato (4th largest producer in the world, second only to China, Malawi and Nigeria);
  * 3.4 million tons of banana (10th largest producer in the world, 13th adding plantain production);
  * 3 million tons of rice;
  * 3 million tons of sugarcane;
  * 1.7 million tons of potato;
  * 1.2 million tons of beans (6th largest producer in the world);
  * 940 thousand tons of peanut (7th largest producer in the world);
  * 930 thousand tons of sunflower seed (12th largest producer in the world);
  * 808 thousand tons of sorghum;
  * 561 thousand tons of sesame seed (5th largest producer in the world, losing only to Sudan, Myanmar, India and Nigeria);
  * 546 thousand tons of coconut (11th largest producer in the world);
  * 454 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);
  * 389 thousand tons of pineapple;
  * 373 thousand tons of orange;
  * 356 thousand tons of tomato;
  * 238 thousand tons of cotton;
  * 171 thousand tons of cashew nuts (6th largest producer in the world);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like
tobacco (107 thousand tons, 8th largest producer in the world), coffee (55
thousand tons), tea (36 thousand tons) and sisal (33 thousand tons).

## Industry

Industries are a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy,
contributing 22.2 percent of GDP in 2013. This component includes mining and
quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and natural gas, water supply, and
construction.

### Mining

Mining contributed 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The vast majority of the
country's mineral export revenue comes from gold, accounting for 89 percent of
the value of those exports in 2013. It also exports sizable quantities of
gemstones, including diamonds and tanzanite. All of Tanzania's coal
production, which totalled 106,000 short tons in 2012, is used domestically.

#### Minerals

Other minerals exploited in Tanzania include;

  1. Pozzolana
  2. Salt
  3. Gypsum
  4. Kaolinite
  5. Silver ore
  6. Copper
  7. Phosphate
  8. Tanzanite
  9. Tin
  10. Graphite
  11. Bauxite.

Modern gold mining in Tanzania started in the German colonial period,
beginning with gold discoveries near Lake Victoria in 1894. The first gold
mine in what was then Tanganyika, the Sekenke Gold Mine, began operation in
1909, and gold mining in Tanzania experienced a boom between 1930 and World
War II. By 1967, gold production in the country had dropped to insignificance
but was revived in the mid-1970s, when the gold price rose once more. In the
late 1990s, foreign mining companies started investing in the exploration and
development of gold deposits in Tanzania, leading to the opening of a number
of new mines, like the Golden Pride mine, which opened in 1999 as the first
modern gold mine in the country, or the Buzwagi mine, which opened in 2009.

Buzwagi Gold Mine

Nickel reserves amounting to 290,000 tonnes were discovered in October 2012 by
Ngwena Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Australian mining company IMX
Resources. An initial investment of around USD $38 million has been made since
exploration began in 2006, and nickel should start being mined at the end of
2015.

Chinese firms have been showing major interest in Tanzania's mineral deposits;
an announcement was made in late 2011 of a plan by the Sichuan Hongda Group,
to invest about US$3 billion to develop the Mchuchuma coal and Liganga iron
ore projects in the south of the country. It was also announced in August 2012
that China National Gold Corp are in talks to purchase mining assets in
Tanzania from African Barrick Gold, in a deal that could be worth more than £2
billion stg.

In November 2012, the Tanzanian government announced investigations into
allegations that mining investors in the country were harassing and on some
occasions, killing residents around mining sites.

### Electricity

The government-owned Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO)
dominates the electric supply industry in Tanzania. The country generated
6.013 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity in 2013, a 4.2 percent
increase over the 5.771 billion kWh generated in 2012. Generation increased by
63 percent between 2005 and 2012; however, only 15 percent of Tanzanians had
access to electric power in 2011. Almost 18 percent of the electricity
generated in 2012 was lost because of theft and transmission and distribution
problems. The electrical supply varies, particularly when droughts disrupt
hydropower electric generation; rolling blackouts are implemented as
necessary. The unreliability of the electrical supply has hindered the
development of Tanzanian industry. In 2013, 49.7 percent of Tanzania's
electricity generation came from natural gas, 28.9 percent from hydroelectric
sources, 20.4 percent from thermal sources, and 1.0 percent from outside the
country. The government is building a 532 kilometres (331 mi) gas pipeline
from Mnazi Bay to Dar es Salaam, with a scheduled completion in 2015. This
pipeline is expected to allow the country to double its electricity generation
capacity to 3,000 megawatts by 2016. The government's goal is to increase
capacity to at least 10,000 megawatts by 2025.

### Natural gas

Songo Songo Gas Plant

According to PFC Energy, 25 to 30 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural
gas resources have been discovered in Tanzania since 2010. The value of
natural gas actually produced in 2013 was US$52.2 million, a 42.7 percent
increase over 2012.

Commercial production of gas from the Songo Songo Island field in the Indian
Ocean commenced in 2004, thirty years after it was discovered there. Over 35
billion cubic feet of gas was produced from this field in 2013, with proven,
probable, and possible reserves totalling 1.1 trillion cubic feet. The gas is
transported by pipeline to Dar es Salaam. As of 27 August 2014, TANESCO owed
the operator of this field, Orca Exploration Group Inc., US$50.4 million, down
from US$63.8 million two months earlier.

A newer natural gas field in Mnazi Bay in 2013 produced about one-seventh of
the amount produced near Songo Songo Island but has proven, probable, and
possible reserves of 2.2 trillion cubic feet. Virtually all of that gas is
being used for electricity generation in Mtwara.

The Indian Ocean, off the coast of Mozambique and Tanzania, is proving to be a
rich hunting ground for natural gas exploration. According to US Geological
Survey estimates, the combined gas reserves of Mozambique and Tanzania could
be as high as 250 trillion cubic feet. In Mozambique alone, proven gas
reserves have increased dramatically from a mere 4.6 trillion cubic feet in
2013 to 98.8 trillion cubic feet as of mid-2015. Given continued offshore
discoveries and the size of discoveries to date, continued growth in proven
gas reserves is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.

In 2014, Tanzania's natural gas production was 19 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a
30% decline from five years prior, but increased in mid-2015 following the
commencement of operations at the Mnazi Bay Concession and a new pipeline to
Dar es Salaam. Significant gas discoveries, including 16 to 17 trillion cubic
feet (Tcf) by the BG Group and partners, and 22 Tcf by Statoil with
ExxonMobil, have positioned Tanzania to potentially become an LNG exporter.
However, development plans, including an LNG plant agreed upon in 2014 with
international companies and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation
(TPDC), have not advanced to sanctioning.

New exploration on more frontier blocks, however, will likely be slowed as oil
and gas prices fall and companies apply increasing caution to investing in
frontier markets with nascent industries, poor infrastructure and long lead
times.

The exploration and development of natural gas in Tanzania have boosted its
economic framework. In 2024, the Ntorya gas field received a 25-year
development license, a major step in harnessing Tanzania's natural gas.
Managed by ARA Petroleum Tanzania Limited (APT), this field is expected to
begin producing substantial gas quantities for domestic use within a year.
Initial production is projected at 40 million cubic feet per day, with
potential expansion to 140 million cubic feet per day in future years.

## External trade and investment

Tanzanian exports in 2006

Tanzania's history of political stability has encouraged foreign direct
investment. The government has committed itself to improve the investment
climate including redrawing tax codes, floating the exchange rate, licensing
foreign banks, and creating an investment promotion centre to cut red tape.
Its economy is currently being managed according to the Tanzania Mini-Tiger
Plan. Tanzania has mineral resources and a largely untapped tourism sector,
which might make it a viable market for foreign investment.

The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Tanzania was valued at
$588 million in 2005 by the World Bank.

## Zanzibar

Zanzibar's economy is based primarily on the production of cloves (90% grown
on the island of Pemba), the principal foreign exchange earner. Exports have
suffered from the downturn in the clove market.

The Government of Zanzibar has been more aggressive than its mainland
counterpart in instituting economic reforms and has legalized foreign exchange
bureaus on the islands. This has loosened up the economy and dramatically
increased the availability of consumer commodities. Furthermore, with external
funding, the government plans to make the port of Zanzibar a free port.
Rehabilitation of current port facilities and plans to extend these facilities
will be the precursor to the free port. The island's manufacturing sector is
limited mainly to import substitution industries, such as cigarettes, shoes,
and process agricultural products. In 1992, the government designated two
export-producing zones and encouraged the development of offshore financial
services. Zanzibar still imports much of its staple requirements, petroleum
products, and manufactured articles.
