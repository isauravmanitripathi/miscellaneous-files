The **economy of Chad** suffers from the landlocked country's geographic
remoteness, drought, lack of infrastructure, and political turmoil. About 80%
of the population depends on subsistence agriculture, including livestock
herding. Of Africa's Francophone countries, Chad benefited least from the 50%
devaluation of their currencies in January 1994. Financial aid from the World
Bank, the African Development Bank, and other sources is directed mainly at
improving agriculture, especially livestock production. Because of a lack of
financing, the development of oil fields near Doba, originally due to finish
in 2000, was delayed until 2003. It was finally developed and is now operated
by ExxonMobil. until 2023 Regarding gross domestic product, Chad ranks 147th
globally with $11.051 billion as of 2018.
