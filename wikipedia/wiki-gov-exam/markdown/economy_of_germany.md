The economy of Germany is a highly developed social market economy. It has the
largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the
world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency
exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but it
is among the world's top 4 since 1960. In 2025, the country accounted for
23.7% of the Euro area economy according to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). Germany is a founding member of the European Union and the eurozone.

Germany is the third-largest exporter globally with $1.66 trillion worth of
goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus
worth $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes
around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%. Exports
accounted for 50.3% of national output. The top 10 exports of Germany are
vehicles, machinery, chemical goods, electronic products, electrical
equipment, pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, basic metals, food products,
and rubber and plastics. Germany is the largest manufacturing economy in
Europe, contributing around one third of all manufacturing in Europe, which
makes it more resilient to global economic crises. Germany conducts applied
research with practical industrial value and sees itself as a bridge between
the latest university insights and industry-specific product and process
improvements. It generates a great deal of knowledge in its own laboratories.
Among OECD members, Germany has a highly efficient and strong social security
system, which comprises roughly 25% of GDP.

Germany is rich in timber, lignite, potash, and salt. Some minor sources of
natural gas are being exploited in the state of Lower Saxony. Until German
reunification, the German Democratic Republic mined for uranium in the Ore
Mountains (see also: SAG/SDAG Wismut). Energy in Germany is sourced
predominantly by fossil fuels (30%), with wind power in second place, then
gas, solar, biomass (wood and biofuels), and hydro. Germany is the first major
industrialised nation to commit to the renewable energy transition called
_Energiewende_. Renewables produced 46% of electricity consumed in Germany (as
of 2019). Germany has been called "the world's first major renewable energy
economy". Germany has the world's second-largest gold reserve, with over 3,000
tonnes of gold. As of 2023, Germany spends around 3.1% of GDP, third among
major economies, on research and development. It is also the world's second-
largest high-technology exporter and ranks in the top 10 of countries by stock
market capitalization.

More than 99 percent of all German companies belong to the German
"_Mittelstand_ ", small and medium-sized enterprises, which are mostly family-
owned. These companies represent 48% of the global market leaders in their
segments, labelled hidden champions. Of the world's 500 largest publicly
listed companies measured by revenue, the Fortune Global 500, 29 are
headquartered in Germany, as are 26 of Europe's 100 largest. Germany is home
to many financial centres and economically important cities, such as Berlin,
Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Stuttgart. Four German banks are
among the biggest in the world. Germany is the world's top location for trade
fairs; around two thirds of the world's leading trade fairs take place in
Germany. Some of the largest international trade fairs and congresses are held
in several German cities such as Hanover, Frankfurt, Cologne, Leipzig, and
Düsseldorf.

## History

Real GDP per capita development in Germany since 1820

### Age of Industrialisation

The Industrial Revolution in Germany got underway approximately a century
later than in the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, partly because Germany
only became a unified country in 1871.

  * Train factory of August Borsig in 1847

  * Many companies, such as steam-machine producer J. Kemna, modeled themselves on English industry.

  * BASF plant in Ludwigshafen, 1881

  * The invention of the automobile. Bertha Benz and Karl Benz in a Benz Viktoria, model 1894

  * The invention of the cruise ship. Albert Ballin's SS _Auguste Viktoria_ in 1890

  * Railway construction as an expression of the Industrial Revolution (here the Bonn-Cölner railway around 1844)

  * The LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin of DELAG, the world's first airline

  * Krupp factory in Essen, (c. 1905), when Krupp was Europe´s largest company

The establishment of the _DeutscherZollverein_ (German Customs Union) in 1834
and the expansion of railway systems were the main drivers of Germany's
industrial development and political union. From 1834, tariff barriers between
increasing numbers of the _Kleindeutschland_ German states were
eliminated.[_citation needed_] In 1835 the first German railway linked the
Franconian cities of Nuremberg and Fürth – it proved so successful that the
decade of the 1840s saw "railway mania" in all the German states. Between 1845
and 1870, 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi) of rail had been built and in 1850
Germany was building its own locomotives. Over time, other German states
joined the customs union and started linking their railroads, which began to
connect the corners of Germany. The growth of free trade and a rail system
across Germany intensified economic development which opened up new markets
for local products, created a pool of middle managers,[_clarification needed_]
increased the demand for engineers, architects, and skilled machinists, and
stimulated investments in coal and iron.

Another factor that propelled German industry forward was the unification of
the monetary system, made possible in part by political unification. The
Deutsche Mark, a new monetary coinage system backed by gold, was introduced in
1871. However, this system did not fully come into use as silver coins
retained their value until 1907.[_citation needed_]

The victory of Prussia and her allies over Napoleon III of France in the
Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 marked the end of French hegemony in Europe
and resulted in the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871. The
establishment of the empire inherently presented Europe with the reality of a
new populous and industrialising polity possessing a considerable, and
undeniably increasing, economic and diplomatic presence. The influence of
French economic principles produced important institutional reforms in
Germany, including the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large
landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and
the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nonetheless,
political decisions about the economy of the empire were still largely
controlled by a coalition of "rye and iron", that is the Prussian Junker
landowners of the east and the Ruhr heavy industry of the west.

Regarding politics and society, between 1881 and 1889 Chancellor Otto von
Bismarck promoted laws that provided social insurance and improved working
conditions. He instituted the world's first welfare state. Germany was the
first to introduce social insurance programmes including universal healthcare,
compulsory education, sickness insurance, accident insurance, disability
insurance, and a retirement pension. Moreover, the government's universal
education policy bore fruit with Germany achieving[_when?_] the highest
literacy rate in the world – 99% – education levels that provided the nation
with more people good at handling numbers, more engineers, chemists,
opticians, skilled workers for its factories, skilled managers, knowledgeable
farmers, and skilled military personnel.

By 1900, Germany surpassed Britain in steel production and became the largest
producer behind only the United States. The German economic miracle was also
intensified by unprecedented population growth from 35 million in 1850 to 67
million in 1913. From 1895 to 1907, the number of workers engaged in machine
building doubled from half a million to well over a million. Only 40 percent
of Germans lived in rural areas by 1910, a drop from 67% at the birth of the
Empire. Industry accounted for 60 percent of the gross national product in
1913. The German chemical industry became the most advanced in the world, and
by 1914 the country was producing half the world's electrical equipment.

The rapid advance to industrial maturity led to a drastic shift in Germany's
economic situation – from a rural economy into a major exporter of finished
goods. The ratio of the finished product to total exports jumped from 38% in
1872 to 63% in 1912. By 1913 Germany had come to dominate all the European
markets. By 1914 Germany had become one of the biggest exporters in the world.

### Weimar Republic and Third Reich

The Nazis rose to power while unemployment was very high, but achieved full
employment later thanks to massive public works programmes such as the
_Reichsbahn_, _Reichspost_ , and the _Reichsautobahn_ projects. In 1935
rearmament in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles added to the economy.

The post-1931 financial crisis economic policies of expansionary fiscal
policies (as Germany was off the gold standard) was advised by their non-Nazi
Minister of Economics, Hjalmar Schacht, who in 1933 became the president of
the central bank. Schacht later resigned from the post in 1938 and was
replaced by Hermann Göring.

The trading policies of the Third Reich aimed at self-sufficiency but with a
lack of raw materials Germany would have to maintain trade links but on
bilateral preferences, foreign exchange controls, import quotas, and export
subsidies under what was called the "New Plan"(_Neuer Plan_) of 19 September
1934. The "New Plan" was based on trade with less developed countries who
would trade raw materials for German industrial goods saving currency.
Southern Europe was preferable to Western Europe and North America as there
could be no trade blockades. This policy became known as the
_Grosswirtschaftsraum_ ("greater economic area") policy.

Eventually, the Nazi party developed strong relationships with big business
and abolished trade unions in 1933 in order to form the Reich Labour Service
(RAD), German Labour Front (DAF) to set working hours, Beauty of Labour (SDA)
which set working conditions, and Strength through Joy (KDF) to ensure sports
clubs for workers.

### West Germany

The Volkswagen Beetle was an icon of West German reconstruction.

Beginning with the replacement of the Reichsmark with the Deutsche Mark as
legal tender, a lasting period of low inflation and rapid industrial growth
was overseen by the government led by German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and
his minister of economics, Ludwig Erhard, raising West Germany from total
wartime devastation to one of the most developed nations in modern Europe.

In 1953 it was decided that Germany was to repay $1.1 billion of the aid it
had received. The last repayment was made in June 1971.

Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the
population in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s and extra labour supplied by
thousands of _Gastarbeiter_ ("guest workers") provided a vital base for the
economic upturn.

### East Germany

The Trabant was an icon of East Germany.

By the early 1950s, the Soviet Union had seized reparations in the form of
agricultural and industrial products and demanded further heavy reparation
payments. Silesia with the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, and Stettin, a prominent
natural port, were lost to Poland.

Exports from West Germany exceeded $323 billion in 1988. In the same year,
East Germany exported $30.7 billion worth of goods; 65% to other communist
states. East Germany had zero unemployment.

Car markers like the Automobilwerk Eisenach and the HQM Sachsenring GmbH
produced icons of the East German economy like the Trabant line and the
Wartburg line.

### Federal Republic

As of 2013[update], Germany is the third-largest exporter and third-largest
importer in the world, producing the largest trade surplus as a national
economy.

The German economy practically stagnated in the beginning of the 2000s. The
worst growth figures were achieved in 2002 (+1.4%), in 2003 (+1.0%), and in
2005 (+1.4%). Unemployment was also chronically high. Due to these problems,
together with Germany's aging population, the welfare system came under
considerable strain. This led the government to push through a wide-ranging
programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market
reforms known as Hartz I - IV.

In the later part of the first decade of 2000, the world economy experienced
high growth, from which Germany as a leading exporter also profited. Some
credit the Hartz reforms with achieving high growth and declining unemployment
but others contend that they resulted in a massive decrease in standards of
living and that its effects are limited and temporary.

The nominal GDP of Germany contracted in the second and third quarters of
2008, putting the country in a technical recession following a global and
European recession cycle. German industrial output dropped to 3.6% in
September vis-à-vis August. In January 2009 the German government under Angela
Merkel approved a €50 billion ($70 billion) economic stimulus plan to protect
several sectors from a downturn and a subsequent rise in unemployment rates.
Germany exited the recession in the second and third quarters of 2009, mostly
due to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports - primarily from outside
the eurozone - and relatively steady consumer demand.

Germany is a founding member of the EU, the G8, and the G20, and was the
world's largest exporter from 2003 to 2008. In 2011 it remained the third
largest exporter and third largest importer. Most of the country's exports are
in engineering, especially machinery, automobiles, chemical goods, and metals.
Germany is a leading producer of wind turbines and solar-power technology.
Annual trade fairs and congresses are held in cities throughout Germany. 2011
was a record-breaking year for the German economy. German companies exported
goods worth over €1 trillion ($1.3 trillion), the highest figure in history.
The number of people in work has risen to 41.6 million, the highest recorded
figure.

Through 2012, Germany's economy continued to be stronger relative to local
neighbouring nations. In 2023, Germany experienced economic difficulties as a
result of the closure of Russian natural gas resources due to international
sanctions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany imported 55% of
its gas from Russia at the time when Russia started the invasion in 2022. Amid
a global energy crisis, Chancellor Olaf Scholz committed to weaken dependence
on Russian energy imports by halting certification of Nord Stream 2, while
also committing to his long-term predecessor Angela Merkel's policy of phasing
out nuclear energy.

As of December 2023, Germany is the third largest economy in nominal terms in
the world after the United States and China, and the largest economy in
Europe. It is the third largest export nation in the world.

In April 2024, a report by the German Economic Institute revealed that despite
attempts to expand into other markets, the German economy remains heavily
reliant on China for various products and raw materials.

During 2024, the German economy experienced its second consecutive year of
contraction. Europe's largest economy declined by 0.2% over the year,
following a 0.3% contraction in 2023. Germany's trade surplus with the United
States, reported by Reuters to have reached a record €65 billion (£54.7
billion) during the first 11 months of 2024, has made the nation a likely
target for potential tariffs from Donald Trump's administration. The economic
climate has also been affected by widespread layoffs across major German
corporations. Companies such as Siemens, Bosch, Thyssenkrupp, and Deutsche
Bahn, all featured in the Fortune 500, are estimated to have collectively cut
over 60,000 jobs during the first 10 months of 2024. Bosch, a highly regarded
manufacturing firm, announced in November alone plans to reduce its workforce
by approximately 7,000 employees.

Germany is recognised for its specialised small and medium enterprises, known
as the _Mittelstand_ model. SMEs account for more than 99 percent of German
companies. Around 1,000 of these companies are global market leaders in their
segment and are labelled hidden champions.

From 1991 to 2010, 40,301 mergers and acquisitions with an involvement of
German firms with a total known value of 2,422 bil. EUR have been announced.
The largest transactions since 1991 are: the acquisition of Mannesmann by
Vodafone for 204.8 bil. EUR in 1999, the merger of Daimler-Benz with Chrysler
to form DaimlerChrysler in 1998 valued at 36.3 bil. EUR.

Berlin developed an international startup ecosystem and became a leading
location for venture capital funded firms in the European Union.

The sector with the highest number of companies registered in Germany is
Services with 1,443,708 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real
Estate and Construction with 480,593 and 173,167 companies respectively.

### Mergers and acquisitions

Since German reunification, there have been 52,258 mergers or acquisitions
deals inbound or outbound in Germany. The most active year in terms of value
was 1999 with a total value of 48 billion EUR, twice as much as the runner up
which was 2006 with 24 billion EUR (see graphic "M&A in Germany").

Here is a list of the top 10 deals (ranked by value) that include a German
company. The Vodafone–Mannesmann deal is still the biggest deal in global
history.

## Economic region

Germany is part of a monetary union, the eurozone (dark blue), and of the EU
single market.

Germany as a federation is a polycentric country and does not have a single
economic centre. The stock exchange is located in Frankfurt am Main, the
largest Media company (Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA) is headquartered in
Gütersloh; the largest car manufacturers are in Wolfsburg (Volkswagen),
Stuttgart (Mercedes-Benz and Porsche), and Munich (Audi and BMW).

Germany is an advocate of closer European economic and political integration.
Its commercial policies are increasingly determined by agreements among
European Union (EU) members and EU single market legislation. Germany
introduced the common European currency, the euro on 1 January 1999. Its
monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

The southern states ("_Bundesländer_ "), especially Bayern, Baden-Württemberg,
and Hessen, are economically stronger than the northern states. One of
Germany's traditionally strongest (and at the same time oldest) economic
regions is the Ruhr area in the west, between Duisburg and Dortmund. 27 of the
country's 100 largest companies are located there. In recent years, however,
the area, whose economy is based on natural resources and heavy industry, has
seen a substantial rise in unemployment (2010: 8.7%).

The economy of Bayern and Baden-Württemberg, the states with the lowest number
of unemployed people (2018: 2.7%, 3.1%), on the other hand, is based on high-
value products. Important sectors are automobiles, electronics, aerospace, and
biomedicine, among others. Baden-Württemberg is an industrial centre
especially for the automobile and machine-building industry and the home of
brands like Mercedes-Benz (Daimler), Porsche and Bosch.

With the reunification on 3 October 1990, Germany began the major task of
reconciling the economic systems of the two former republics. Interventionist
economic planning ensured gradual development in eastern Germany up to the
level of former West Germany, but the standard of living and annual income
remains significantly higher in western German states. The modernisation and
integration of the eastern German economy continues to be a long-term process
scheduled to last until the year 2019, with annual transfers from west to east
amounting to roughly $80 billion. The overall unemployment rate has
consistently fallen since 2005 and reached a 20-year low in 2012. The country
in July 2014 began legislating to introduce a federally mandated minimum wage
which would come into effect on 1 January 2015.[_needs update_]

On 25 May 2023, a declaration of a recession in the German economy was made.
It was reported that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had contracted by 0.3%
between January and March. This contraction was largely due to increased
prices which discouraged consumer spending. The statistics office in Germany
reported that household spending had dropped by 1.2% in the first quarter of
the year.

### German states

## Sectors

German exports in 2006

Germany has a social market economy characterised by a highly qualified labour
force, a developed infrastructure, a large capital stock, a low level of
corruption, and a high level of innovation. It has the largest national
economy in Europe, the third largest by nominal GDP in the world, and ranked
fifth by GDP (PPP) in 2023.

The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%,
and agriculture 0.9%.

### Primary

German wine region Rheingau. Germany is the EU´s second-largest agriculture
goods exporter and the fourth-largest worldwide

In 2010 agriculture, forestry, and mining accounted for only 0.9% of Germany's
gross domestic product (GDP) and employed only 2.4% of the population, down
from 4% in 1991. Agriculture is extremely productive, and Germany can cover
90% of its nutritional needs with domestic production. Germany is the third-
largest agricultural producer in the European Union after France and Italy.
Germany's principal agricultural products are potatoes, wheat, barley, sugar
beets, fruit, and cabbages.

Despite the country's high level of industrialisation, almost one-third of its
territory is covered by forest. The forestry industry provides for about two-
thirds of domestic consumption of wood and wood products, so Germany is a net
importer of these items.

Strip mining lignite at Tagebau Garzweiler near Grevenbroich, Germany

The German soil is relatively poor in raw materials. Only lignite (brown coal)
and potash salt (_Kalisalz_) are available in significant quantities. However,
the former GDR's Wismut mining company produced a total of 230,400 tonnes of
uranium between 1947 and 1990 and made East Germany the fourth-largest
producer of uranium ore worldwide (largest in USSR's sphere of control) at the
time. Oil, natural gas, and other resources are, for the most part, imported
from other countries.

Potash salt is mined in the centre of the country (Niedersachsen, Sachsen-
Anhalt, and Thüringen). The most important producer is K+S (formerly Kali und
Salz AG).

Germany's bituminous coal deposits were created more than 300 million years
ago from swamps which extended from the present-day South England, over the
Ruhr area to Poland. Lignite deposits developed similarly, but during a later
period, about 66 million years ago. Because the wood is not yet completely
transformed into coal, brown coal contains less energy than bituminous coal.

Lignite is extracted in the extreme western and eastern parts of the country,
mainly in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Sachsen, and Brandenburg. Considerable amounts
are burned in coal plants near the mining areas, to produce electricity.
Transporting lignite over far distances is not economically feasible,
therefore the plants are located practically next to the extraction sites.
Bituminous coal is mined in Nordrhein-Westfalen and Saarland. Most power
plants burning bituminous coal operate on imported material, therefore the
plants are located not only near to the mining sites, but throughout the
country.

In 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of selenium, the
world's 5th largest producer of potash, the world's 5th largest producer of
boron, the world's 7th largest producer of lime, the world's 13th largest
producer of fluorspar, the world's 14th largest producer of feldspar, the
world's 17th largest producer of graphite, the world's 18th largest producer
of sulfur, in addition to being the 4th largest world producer of salt.

### Industry

The world's largest coherent chemistry plant BASF in Ludwigshafen

Industry and construction accounted for 30.7% of the gross domestic product in
2017 and employed 24.2% of the workforce. Germany excels in the production of
automobiles, machinery, electrical equipment, and chemicals. With the
manufacture of 5.2 million vehicles in 2009, Germany was the world's fourth-
largest producer and largest exporter of automobiles. German automotive
companies enjoy an extremely strong position in the so-called premium segment,
with a combined world market share of about 90%. All new automobiles sold in
Germany must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.

Small- to medium-sized manufacturing firms (_Mittelstand_ companies) which
specialise in technologically advanced niche products and are often family-
owned form a major part of the German economy. It is estimated that about
1,500 German companies occupy a top three position in their respective market
segment worldwide. In about two thirds of all industry sectors German
companies belong to the top three competitors.

Germany is the only country among the top five arms exporters that is not a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

### Services

In 2017 services constituted 68.6% of gross domestic product (GDP), and the
sector employed 74.3% of the workforce. The subcomponents of services are
financial, renting, and business activities (30.5%); trade, hotels and
restaurants, and transport (18%); and other service activities (21.7%).

Germany is the seventh most visited country in the world, with a total of 407
million overnights during 2012. This number includes 68.83 million nights by
foreign visitors. In 2012, over 30.4 million international tourists arrived in
Germany. Berlin has become the third most visited city destination in Europe.
Additionally, more than 30% of Germans spend their holiday in their own
country, with the biggest share going to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Domestic and
international travel and tourism combined directly contribute over EUR43.2
billion to German GDP. Including indirect and induced impacts, the industry
contributes 4.5% of German GDP and supports 2 million jobs (4.8% of total
employment). The largest annual international trade fairs and congresses are
held in several German cities such as Hannover, Frankfurt, and Berlin.

The debt-to-GDP ratio of Germany had its peak in 2010 when it stood at 80.3%
and decreased since then. According to Eurostat, the government gross debt of
Germany amounts to €2,152.0 billion or 71.9% of its GDP in 2015. The federal
government achieved a budget surplus of €12.1 billion ($13.1 billion) in 2015.
Germany's credit rating by credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's, Moody's,
and Fitch Ratings stands at the highest possible rating _AAA_ with a stable
outlook in 2016.

Germany's "debt clock" (_Schuldenuhr_) reversed for the first time in 20 years
in January 2018. It is now currently increasing at 10,424.00 per second
(October 2020).

Economists generally see Germany's current account surplus as undesirable.

## Infrastructure

### Energy

Germany is the world's fifth-largest consumer of energy, and two-thirds of its
primary energy was imported in 2002. In the same year, Germany was Europe's
largest consumer of electricity, totaling 512.9 terawatt-hours. Government
policy promotes energy conservation and the development of renewable energy
sources, such as solar, wind, biomass, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy.
As a result of energy-saving measures, energy efficiency has been improving
since the beginning of the 1970s. The government has set the goal of meeting
half the country's energy demands from renewable sources by 2050. Renewable
energy also plays an increasing role in the labour market: Almost 700,000
people are employed in the energy sector. About 50 percent of them work with
renewable energies.

The largest solar power and third-largest wind power capacity in the world is
installed in Germany.

In 2000, the red-green coalition under Chancellor Schröder and the German
nuclear power industry agreed to phase out all nuclear power plants by 2021.
The conservative coalition under Chancellor Merkel reversed this decision in
January 2010, electing to keep plants open. The nuclear disaster of the
Japanese nuclear plant Fukushima in March 2011 however, changed the political
climate fundamentally: Older nuclear plants have been shut down. Germany is
seeking to have wind, solar, biogas, and other renewable energy sources play a
bigger role, as the country looks to completely phase out nuclear power by
2022 and coal-fired power plants by 2038. Renewable energy yet still plays a
more modest role in energy consumption, though German solar and wind power
industries play a leading role worldwide. Germany has been called "the world's
first major renewable energy economy".

In 2009, Germany's total energy consumption (not just electricity) came from
the following sources: oil 34.6%, natural gas 21.7%, lignite 11.4%, bituminous
coal 11.1%, nuclear power 11.0%, hydro and wind power 1.5%, others 9.0%.

In the first half of 2021, coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy comprised 56%
of the total electricity fed into Germany's grid in the first half of 2021.
Coal was the leader out of the conventional energy sources, comprising over
27% of Germany's electricity. Wind power's contribution to the electric grid
was 22%.

There are 3 major entry points for oil pipelines: in the northeast (the
Druzhba pipeline, coming from Gdańsk), west (coming from Rotterdam) and
southeast (coming from Nelahozeves). The oil pipelines of Germany do not
constitute a proper network, and sometimes only connect two different
locations. Major oil refineries are located in or near the following cities:
Schwedt, Spergau, Vohburg, Burghausen, Karlsruhe, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen,
Lingen, Wilhelmshaven, Hamburg, and Heide.

Germany's network of natural gas pipelines, on the other hand, is dense and
well-connected. Imported pipeline gas comes mostly from Russia, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

### Transport

The ICE 3 trainset, here run by Deutsche Bahn, in Frankfurt

With its central position in Europe, Germany is an important transportation
hub. This is reflected in its dense and modern transportation networks. The
extensive motorway (_Autobahn_) network ranks worldwide third largest in its
total length and features a lack of blanket speed limits on the majority of
routes.

Germany has established a polycentric network of high-speed trains. The
Intercity Express or _ICE_ is the most advanced service category of the
Deutsche Bahn and serves major German cities as well as destinations in
neighbouring countries. The train maximum speed varies between 200 km/h and
320 km/h (125-200 mph). Connections are offered at either 30-minute, hourly,
or two-hourly intervals. German railways are heavily subsidised, receiving
€17.0 billion in 2014.

The largest German airports are Frankfurt Airport and Munich Airport, both are
global hubs of Lufthansa. Other major airports are Berlin Brandenburg Airport,
Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne/Bonn, and Stuttgart.

### Banking system

Seven German banks are among the biggest in the world. As of 2019, Germany is
the country in Europe with the highest number of credit institutions: between
1,600 and 1,800. The types of institutions are in strong competition with each
other: 390 _Sparkassen_ and 8 public _Landesbanken_ groups (1,200 billion
euros of deposits), private commercial banks (DB, Commerzbank, and Unicredit-
HypoVereinsbank, for 780 billion), cooperative credit banks (700 billion
euros), savings banks, and _Raiffeisen_. The total of the system is worth
3,800 billion. 75% of retail customer deposits are managed by savings banks
and cooperative credit banks.

According to Eurostat, in 2022 Germany also recorded the highest European rate
of gross savings (19.98% of disposable income).

## Technology

Liquid crystal as visualised by a polarizing microscope. Germany is a pioneer
research centre for nanotechnology and materials engineering.

Germany's achievements in sciences have been significant, and research and
development efforts form an integral part of the economy.

Germany is also one of the leading countries in developing and using green
technologies. Companies specialising in green technology have an estimated
turnover of €200 billion. German expertise in engineering, science, and
research is eminently respectable.

The lead markets of Germany's green technology industry are power generation,
sustainable mobility, material efficiency, energy efficiency, waste management
and recycling, sustainable water management.

Regarding triadic patents, Germany is in third place after the U.S. and Japan.
With more than 26,500 registrations for patents submitted to the European
Patent Office, Germany is the leading European nation. Siemens, Bosch, and
BASF, with almost 5,000 registrations for patents between them in 2008, are
among the top 5 of more than 35,000 companies registering patents. Together
with the U.S. and Japan, about patents for nano, bio, and new technologies
Germany is one of the world's most active nations. With around one-third of
triadic patents, Germany leads the way worldwide in the field of vehicle
emission reduction.

According to Winfried Kretschmann, who is premier of the region where Daimler
is based, "China dominates the production of solar cells. Tesla is ahead in
electric cars and Germany has lost the first round of digitalization to
Google, Apple, and the like. Whether Germany has a future as an industrial
economy will depend on whether we can manage the ecological and digital
transformation of our economy".

## Challenges

Angela Merkel at the Electromobility conference in Berlin. All new cars sold
in Germany must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.

Despite economic prosperity, Germany's biggest threat to future economic
development is the nation's declining birthrate, which is among the lowest in
the world. This is particularly prevalent in parts of society with higher
education. As a result, the numbers of workers are expected to decrease and
the government spending needed to support pensioners and healthcare will
increase if the trend is not reversed.

Less than a quarter of German people expect living conditions to improve in
the coming decades.

On August 25, 2020, Federal Statistical Office of Germany revealed that the
German economy plunged by 9.7% in the second quarter which is the worst on
record. The latest figures show how hard the German economy was hit by the
government measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Energy-intensive German industry and German exporters were hit particularly
hard by the 2022 global energy crisis. Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned
that the planned end of Russian energy imports will permanently raise energy
prices for German industry and consumers.

In the early 21st century, German governments supported the European Green
Deal and Germany's transition to green energy. Germany planned to phase out
coal by 2030. The last three nuclear power plants in Germany were shut down on
15 April 2023.

Speaking at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai in December 2023, German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for a phase-out of fossil fuels, including coal,
oil and natural gas, and reiterated Germany's commitment to be climate neutral
by 2045, saying, "The technologies are there: wind power, photovoltaics,
electric motors, green hydrogen."

In April 2025, the German government cut its economic growth forecast for 2025
to zero, citing the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies. The
United States is Germany’s largest trading partner, and Habeck said Trump’s
tariffs were going to hit the German economy harder than other nations because
it is so reliant on exports.

### Immigration

In October 2023, Economy Minister Robert Habeck called for more immigration to
Germany, saying the shortage of skilled workers was the country's "most
pressing structural problem". Net immigration to Germany was 663,000 in 2023,
down from a record 1,462,000 in 2022.

### Poverty

A beggar in Trier, Germany

In recent decades, poverty in Germany has been increasing. Children are more
likely to be poor than adults. There has been a strong increase in the number
of poor children. In 1965, only one in 75 children lived on welfare, in 2007
one in 6 did.

Poverty rates differ by states. In 2005, only 6.6% of children and 3.9% of all
citizens in states like Bavaria were impoverished. In Berlin, 15.2% of the
inhabitants and 30.7% of the children received welfare payments.

The German _Kinderhilfswerk_ , an organization caring for children in need has
demanded the government to do something about the poverty problem.

As of 2015, poverty in Germany was at its highest since the German
reunification (1990). Some 12.5 million Germans are now classified as poor.

### Homelessness

Homelessness in Germany is a significant social issue, estimated to affect
around 678,000 people, including about 372,000 people accommodated by public
services, e.g. municipalities, in refugee shelters, etc. As of 2017[update]
there had been a 150% increase in the homeless population within the country
since 2014. Around 22,000 of the homeless population are reported to be
children.[_citation needed_]

In addition, the country has yet to publish statistics on homelessness at a
Federal Level despite it being an ongoing and widespread matter.

### Climate change

As a highly industrial, urbanized economy with a relatively short coastline
compared to other major economies, the effects of climate change on Germany
are more narrowly focused than other major economies. Germany's traditional
industrial regions are typically the most vulnerable to climate change. These
are mostly located in the provinces of North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Thuringia, Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and the free
cities of Bremen and Hamburg.

The Rhineland is historically a heavily industrial and population-dense area
which includes the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland Palatinate, and
Saarland. This region is rich in iron and coal deposits and supports one of
Europe's largest coal industries. In the past, sulfuric acid emissions from
Rhineland coal plants contributed to acid rain, damaging forests in other

challenges including Munich and Bremen.
