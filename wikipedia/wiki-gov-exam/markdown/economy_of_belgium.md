The **economy of Belgium** is a highly developed, high-income, mixed economy.

Belgium's economy has capitalised on the country's central geographic
location, and has a well-developed transport network, and diversified
industrial and commercial base. Belgium was the first European country to join
the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century. It has since developed a
highly-developed transportation infrastructure made up of ports (most notably
the Port of Antwerp), canals, railways, and highways, in order to integrate
its industry with that of its neighbours. Among OECD nations, Belgium has a
highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood
at roughly 29% of GDP.

Belgium's industry is concentrated mainly in the populous region of Flanders
in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and
Charleroi, along the _Sillon industriel_. Belgium imports raw materials and
semi-finished goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its
coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural
resources other than fertile soils. Despite the heavy industrial component,
services dominate the country's economy and account for 77.2% of Belgium's
gross domestic product (GDP), while agriculture accounts for 0.7%.

With exports equivalent to over two-thirds of the country's gross national
income (GNI), Belgium depends heavily on world trade. Belgium's trade
advantages are derived from its central geographic location and a highly
skilled, multilingual, and productive work force. One of the founding members
of the European Community, Belgium strongly supports deepening the powers of
the present-day European Union (EU) to integrate European economies further.
About three-quarters of its trade is with other EU countries. In 2021,
Belgium's public debt was about 108% of the country's gross domestic product
(GDP).

## History

### In the twentieth century

Evolution of the Belgian GDP

For 50 years through World War II, French-speaking Wallonia was a technically
advanced, industrial region, with its industry concentrated along the sillon
industriel, while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with
some industry, mainly processing agricultural products and textiles. This
disparity began to fade during the interwar period. When Belgium emerged from
World War II with its industrial infrastructure relatively undamaged thanks to
the Galopin doctrine, the stage was set for a period of rapid development,
particularly in Flanders. The postwar boom years, enhanced by the
establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels,
contributed to the rapid expansion of light industry throughout most of
Flanders, particularly along a corridor stretching between Brussels and
Antwerp, which is the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam.

Foreign investment contributed significantly to Belgian economic growth in the
1960s. In particular, U.S. firms played a leading role in the expansion of
light industrial and petrochemical industries in the 1960s and 1970s.

The older, traditional industries of Wallonia, particularly the steel
industry, began to lose their competitive edge during this period, but the
general growth of world prosperity masked this deterioration until the 1973
and 1979 oil price shocks and resultant shifts in international demand sent
the economy into a period of prolonged recession. In the 1980s and 1990s, the
economic center of the country continued to shift northwards to Flanders with
investments by multinationals (automotive industry, chemical industry) and
growing local industrial agriculture (for textiles and food).

The early 1980s saw the country facing a difficult period of structural
adjustment caused by declining demand for its traditional products,
deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform.
Consequently, the 1980–82 recession shook Belgium to the core—unemployment
mounted, social welfare costs increased, personal debt soared, the government
deficit climbed to 13% of GDP, and the national debt, although mostly held
domestically, mushroomed.

Against this grim backdrop, in 1982, Prime Minister Martens' center-right
coalition government formulated an economic recovery program to promote
export-led growth by enhancing the competitiveness of Belgium's export
industries through an 8.5% devaluation. Economic growth rose from 2% in 1984
to a peak of 4% in 1989. In May 1990, the government linked the Belgian franc
to the Deutsche Mark, primarily through closely tracking German interest
rates. Consequently, as German interest rates rose after 1990, Belgian rates
have increased and contributed to a decline in the economic growth rate. In
1992–93, the Belgian economy suffered the worst recession since World War II,
with the real GDP declining 0.96% in 1993.

On 1 May 1998, Belgium became a first-tier member of the European Monetary
Union.

### In the twenty-first century

Belgium switched from the Belgian franc to the Euro as its currency after 1
January 2002. Belgian per capita GDP ranks among the world's highest. In 2008,
the per capita income (PPP) was $37,500. The federal government has not
managed to present balanced budgets in recent years and public debt remains
high, at 99% of 2009 GDP.[_citation needed_] In 2009, during the Great
Recession, Belgium suffered negative growth and increased unemployment. GDP
growth in 2009 was −1.5%.

### Trade unions

With 65% of the workers belonging to a union, Belgium is a country with one of
the highest percentages of trade union membership. Only the Scandinavian
countries have a higher trade union density. The biggest union with around 1.7
million members is the Christian democrat Confederation of Christian Trade
Unions (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904. The origins of the union can be
traced back to the "Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union" that was founded in
1886. The second biggest union is the socialist General Federation of Belgian
Labour (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5 million. The ABVV-
FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in
Ghent by a group of weavers. This and other socialist unions became unified
around 1898. The ABVV-FGTB in its current form dates back to 1945. The third
major multi-sector union in Belgium is the liberal (classical liberal) union
General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium (ACLVB-CGSLB) which
is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290
thousand members. The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite
the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the
"Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van België". In 1930, the ACLVB-
CGSLB adopted its current name.

Besides these "big three" there are a number of smaller unions, some more
influential than others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one
profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also
the Neutral and Independent Union that rejects the pillarization of the "big
three" trade unions (their affiliation with political parties). There is also
a small Flemish nationalist union that exists only in the Flemish-speaking
part of Belgium, called the Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond. The last Belgian union
worth mentioning is the very small, but highly active anarchist union called
the Vrije Bond.

## Trade

About 80% of Belgium's trade is with fellow EU member states. Given this high
percentage, it seeks to diversify and expand trade opportunities with non-EU
countries. The Belgian authorities are, as a rule, anti-protectionist and try
to maintain a hospitable and open trade and investment climate. The European
Commission negotiates on trade issues for all member states, which, in turn
lessens bilateral trade disputes with Belgium.

The Belgian Government encourages new foreign investment as a means to promote
employment. With regional devolution, Flanders, Brussels, and Wallonia are now
courting potential foreign investors and offer a host of incentives and
benefits. Foreign companies in Belgium account for approximately 11% of the
total work force, with the U.S.

Attracted by the EU 1992 single-market program, many foreign firms and lawyers
have settled in Brussels since 1989.

## Employment

The social security system, which expanded rapidly during the prosperous 1950s
and 1960s, includes a medical system, unemployment insurance coverage, child
allowances, invalid benefits, and other benefits and pensions. With the onset
of a recession in the 1970s, this system became an increasing burden on the
economy and accounted for much of the government budget deficits. The national
unemployment figures mask considerable differences between Flanders and
Wallonia. Unemployment in Wallonia is mainly structural, while in Flanders it
is cyclical. Flanders' unemployment levels are generally only about half those
of Walloon. The southern region continues a difficult transition out of sunset
industries (mainly coal and steel), while sunrise industries (chemicals, high-
tech, and services) dominate in Flanders.

Belgium's unemployment rate was 6.5% in 2008. A total of 4.99 million people
make up Belgium's labor force. The vast majority of these people (80%), work
in the service sector. The Belgian Industry claims 19% of the labor force; and
agriculture claims 1%. As in other industrialized nations, pension and other
social entitlement programs have become a major economic and political concern
as the baby boomers approach retirement age.

## Budget

Evolution of the Belgian public debt as % of Belgian GDP

Although Belgium is a wealthy country, public expenditures far exceeded income
for many years, and taxes were not diligently pursued. The Belgian Government
reacted to the 1973 and 1979 oil price hikes by hiring the redundant work
force into the public sector and subsidizing industries like coal, steel,
textiles, glass, and shipbuilding, which had lost their international
competitive edge. As a result, cumulative government debt reached 121% of GDP
by the end of the 1980s. However, thanks to Belgium's high personal savings
rate, the Belgian Government financed the deficit from mainly domestic
savings, minimizing the deleterious effects on the overall economy.

The federal government ran a 7.1% budget deficit in 1992 at the time of the
EU's Treaty of Maastricht, which established conditions for Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) that led to adoption of the common Euro currency on 1
January 2002. Among other criteria spelled out under the Maastricht treaty,
the Belgian Government had to attain a budget deficit of no greater than 3% of
GDP by the end of 1997; Belgium achieved this, with a total budget deficit in
2001 (just prior to implementation of the Euro) that amounted to 0.2% of GDP.
The government has balanced the budget every year since, until 2009 where it
ran a deficit of about $25 billion. Belgium's accumulated public debt remains
high at 99% of 2009 GDP. A slight decrease in the accumulated public debt
compared to GDP has been seen, however, thanks to a higher economic growth
rate compared to the budget growth rate, which pushed the percentage from 99%
of GDP in 2009 to 95% of GDP in 2011, a four-point decrease in two years, a
feat rare enough to mention in the Western World.

## Regional differences

The economy of Belgium is varied and cannot be understood without taking the
regional differences into account. Indeed, the Flemish and Walloon economies
differ in many respects (consider for instance Eurostat and OECD statistics),
and cities like Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, Bruges, Charleroi, or Ghent also
exhibit significant differences. In general, productivity in Flanders is
roughly 20% higher (per inhabitant) than in Wallonia.[_citation needed_]
Brussels' GDP per capita is much higher than either region, although this is
misleading, as many of those that work in the Brussels-Capital Region live in
Flanders or Wallonia. Their output is counted in Brussels and not where they
live, artificially raising the _per capita_ GDP of Brussels and slightly
lowering that of Flanders and Wallonia.

Unemployment has remained consistently more than twice as high in Wallonia
than in Flanders, and has been even higher in Brussels, during most of the
last 20 years (2012: Flanders: 4.55%; Wallonia: 10.12% and Brussels: 17.47%).

Gross Domestic Product in Belgium (2022)  Rank  | NUTS region  | Per capita  
in Euros | % of EU average   
---|---|---|---  
1  | Brussels | 69,500  | 196   
2  | Flemish Region | 43,800  | 124   
3  | Walloon Region | 30,700  | 87   
  
### Brussels

Being the _de facto_ capital of the European Union, its economy is very
service-oriented. It has a number of regional headquarters of multinational
corporations. It is also host to a great number of European institutions, in
addition to the Belgian federal government, the government of the Flemish
Community and the government of the French Community. Brussels also has many
commuters, with 230,000 coming from Flanders, and 130,000 from Wallonia. Much
of the success of Brussels is based on the high educational skills of its
workforce. As of July 2012, however, the statistical unemployment rate in
Brussels was 20.6%.

### Flanders

The Bevrijdingsdok [nl] container terminal in the port of Antwerp

In 2004, the port of Antwerp was the second-largest European sea port by cargo
volume, and the Antwerp freight railway station accounts for one-third of
Belgian freight traffic. Antwerp is the first diamond market in the world,
diamond exports account for roughly 1/10 of Belgian exports. The Antwerp-based
BASF plant is the largest BASF-base outside Germany, and accounts on its own
for about 2% of Belgian exports. Other industrial and service activities
include car manufacturing, telecommunications, and photographic products.

The port of Bruges-Zeebrugge is one of the most important, modern and fastest
growing ports in Europe. It is Europe's largest port for RoRo traffic and
natural gas. It also is the world's largest port for the import and export of
new vehicles. Tourism is also a major component of the economy of Bruges. Due
to its pristine medieval city centre, Bruges has become a popular tourist
destination. Annually about 2.5 million day tourists visit the city and in
2007 there were about 1.4 million overnight stays.

The port of Ghent, in the north of the city, is the third-largest port of
Belgium. It is accessed by the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal, which ends near the
Dutch port of Terneuzen on the Western Scheldt. The port houses, among others,
big companies like ArcelorMittal, Volvo Cars, Volvo Trucks, Volvo Parts,
Honda, and Stora Enso. Ghent University, the second-largest university of
Belgium by number of students, and a number of research-oriented companies are
situated in the central and southern part of the city. Tourism is increasingly
becoming a major employer in the local area. Begonias have been cultivated in
the Ghent area since 1860. Belgium is the world's largest producer of
begonias, planting 60 million tubers per year. Eighty percent of the crop is
exported.

### Wallonia

In the past, Liège was one of the most important steel-making centres in
Europe. Starting in 1817, John Cockerill extensively developed the iron and
steel industry. The industrial complex of Seraing was the largest in the
world. Although now a shadow of its former self, steel production and the
manufacture of steel goods remain important.

Liège has also been an important centre for gunsmithing since the Middle Ages,
and the arms industry is still strong with the headquarters of FN Herstal. The
economy of the region is now diversified, the most important centers are
mechanical industries (aircraft engine and spacecraft propulsion), space
technology, information technology, biotechnology and also production of
water, beer, and chocolate. Liège Science Park, southeast of the city, near
the University of Liège campus, houses spin-offs and high technology
businesses. Liège is also a very important logistics center: the city
possesses the third-largest river port in Europe, directly connected to
Antwerp, Rotterdam and Germany via the Meuse river and the Albert Canal. In
2006, Liège Airport was the 8th most important cargo airport in Europe. A new
passenger terminal was opened in 2005. It is also the main hub and the
headquarters of TNT Airways.

Charleroi features an industrial area, iron and steel industry, glassworks,
chemicals, and electrical engineering. Charleroi is in the center of a vast
coal basin, called _Pays Noir_. Many slag heaps still surround the city.
Charleroi is also known for its publishing industry with Dupuis, one of the
main publishers of Franco-Belgian comics, located in Marcinelle.

## Companies

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Belgium
is Services with 433,375 companies followed by Finance, Insurance, and Real
Estate with 169,544 companies.
