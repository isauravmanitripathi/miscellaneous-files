The **economy of Gabon** is characterized by strong links with France, large
foreign investments, dependence on skilled foreign labor, and decline of
agriculture. Gabon on paper enjoys a per capita income four times that of most
nations of Africa, but its reliance on resource extraction industry fail to
release much of the population from extreme poverty, as much of 30% of the
population lives under the poverty threshold (Many Foreign Guest Workers).
Gabon has a free market economy, while other sources claim that Gabon has a
mixed economic system with a heavy reliance on oil, combined with relatively
weak centralized economic planning and government regulation.

## Resources

The country is rich in natural resources such as timber, manganese and oil.
The country is the fifth largest oil producing nation in Africa, which has
helped drive its strong growth in the later 20th century.

The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP and 80% of exports. Although there
have been recent offshore finds, oil production is now declining from its peak
of 370,000 barrels per day (59,000 m3/d) in 1997, and periods of low oil
prices have had a negative impact on government revenues and the economy. In
2012 there were six active oil rigs in Gabon.

As of 2023, Gabon produces about 200,000 barrels a day (bpd) of crude oil.

The government has plans to diversify its economy away from its dwindling oil
reserves. The government announced in 2012 that it would reassess exactly how
much iron ore the Belinga site contains before awarding the concession to a
mining company, most likely to be China's CMEC, which temporarily secured the
rights to the ore in 2007.

Around 80% of Gabonese live in cities. The capital city, Libreville is home to
59% of the total population. The remainder of the country is still sparsely
populated, as those areas remain densely forested.
