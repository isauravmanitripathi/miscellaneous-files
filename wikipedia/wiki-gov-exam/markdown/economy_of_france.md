The economy of France is a highly developed social market economy with notable
state participation in strategic sectors. It is the world's seventh-largest
economy by nominal GDP and the ninth-largest economy by PPP, constituting
around 4% of world GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, France's GDP
as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, being smaller in 2024 than in 2008.
France has a diversified economy, that is dominated by the service sector
(which in 2017 represented 78.8% of its GDP), whilst the industrial sector
accounted for 19.5% of its GDP and the primary sector accounted for the
remaining 1.7%. In 2020, France was the largest Foreign Direct Investment
recipient in Europe, and Europe's second largest spender in research and
development. It was ranked among the 10 most innovative countries in the world
by the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index, as well as the 15th most competitive
nation globally according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up 2
notches compared to 2018). It was the fifth-largest trading nation in the
world (and second in Europe after Germany). France is also the most visited
destination in the world, as well as the European Union's leading agricultural
power.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in 2023, France was the
world's 23rd country by GDP per capita with $44,408 per inhabitant. In 2021,
France was listed on the United Nations's Human Development Index with a value
of 0.903 (indicating very high human development) and 22nd on the Corruption
Perceptions Index in 2021. Among OECD members, France has a highly efficient
and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 31.7% of GDP.

Paris is a leading global city, and has one of the largest city GDP in the
world. It ranks as the first city in Europe (and 3rd worldwide) by the number
of companies classified in _Fortune'_s Fortune Global 500. Paris produced
US$738 billion (or US$882 billion at market exchange rates) or around 1/3 of
the French economy in 2018 while the economy of the Paris metropolitan
area—the largest in Europe with London—generates around 1/3 of France's GDP or
around $1.0 trillion. Paris has been ranked as the 2nd most attractive global
city in the world in 2019 by KPMG. La Défense, Paris's Central Business
District, was ranked by Ernst & Young in 2017 as the leading business district
in continental Europe, and fourth in the world. The OECD is headquartered in
Paris, the nation's financial capital. The other major economic centres of the
country include Lyon, Toulouse (centre of the European aerospace industry),
Marseille and Lille.

France's economy entered the recession of the late 2000s later and appeared to
leave it earlier than most affected economies, only enduring four-quarters of
contraction. However, France experienced stagnant growth between 2012 and
2014, with the economy expanding by 0% in 2012, 0.8% in 2013 and 0.2% in 2014.
Growth picked up in 2015 with a growth of 0.8%. This was followed by a growth
of 1.1% for 2016, a growth of 2.2% for 2017, and a growth of 2.1% for 2018.

According to INSEE (2021), non-financial and non-agricultural medium-sized
firms employed 3 million full-time equivalent employees (24.3% of the
workforce), accounted for 27% of investment, 30% of turnover, and 26% of value
added, despite accounting for only 1.6% of total firms in France.

## Corporations

With 31 companies that are part of the world's biggest 500 companies, France
was in 2020 the most represented European country in the 2020 Fortune Global
500, ahead of Germany (27 companies) and the UK (22).

As of August 2020, France was also the country that weighed the most on the
Eurozone's EURO STOXX 50 (representing 36.4% of all total assets), ahead of
Germany (35.2%).

Several French corporations rank amongst the largest in their industries such
as AXA in insurance and Air France in air transportation. Luxury and consumer
goods are particularly relevant, with L'Oreal being the world's largest
cosmetic company while LVMH and Kering are the world's two largest luxury
product companies. In energy and utilities, GDF-Suez and EDF are amongst the
largest energy companies in the world, and Areva is a large nuclear-energy
company; Veolia Environnement is the world's largest environmental services
and water management company; Vinci SA, Bouygues and Eiffage are large
construction companies; Michelin ranks in the top 3 tire manufacturers;
JCDecaux is the world's largest outdoor advertising corporation; BNP Paribas,
Credit Agricole and Société Générale rank amongst the largest banks in the
world by assets. Capgemini and Atos are among the largest technology
consulting companies.

Carrefour is the world's second-largest retail group in terms of revenue;
Total is the world's fourth-largest private oil company; Lactalis is the
world's largest dairy products group; Sanofi is the world's fifth-largest
pharmaceutical company; Publicis is the world's third-largest advertising
company; Groupe PSA is the world's 6th and Europe's 2nd largest automaker;
Accor is the leading European hotel group; Alstom is one of the world's
leading conglomerates in rail transport.

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in France
is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 2,656,178 companies followed by
Services and Retail Trade with 2,090,320 and 549,395 companies respectively.

## Rise and decline of dirigisme

France embarked on an ambitious and very successful programme of modernisation
under state coordination. This programme of _dirigisme_ , mostly implemented
by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain
industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as
various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain
projects.

The 1981 election of president François Mitterrand saw a short-lived increase
in governmental control of the economy, nationalizing many industries and
private banks. This form of increased _dirigisme_ , was criticised as early as
1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce _dirigisme_ and start an era
of rigueur ("rigor") or corporation. As a result, the government largely
retreated from economic intervention; _dirigisme_ has now essentially receded,
though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under
government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.

Despite being a widely liberalised economy, the government continues to play a
significant role in the economy: government spending, at 56% of GDP in 2014,
is the second-highest in the European Union. Labor conditions and wages are
highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in
several sectors, including energy production and distribution, automobiles,
aerospace industry, shipbuilding, the arms industry, electronics industry,
machine industry, metallurgy, fuels, chemical industry, transportation, and
telecommunications.

in 2016 by expenditure type

In April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner
François Hollande had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate
France's budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to
cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the
top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the
retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years,
restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent
increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.

In June 2012, Hollande's Socialist Party won an overall majority in the
legislative elections, giving it the capability to amend the French
Constitution and allowing immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French
government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows, less than 50 basis
points above German government bond rates.

Hollande's successor as President of France, Emmanuel Macron, a centrist
politician, took office in May 2017. His aim was to revive the euro zone’s
second-largest economy.

In July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued
10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its
history (which means that investors buying French bonds will pay, rather than
receive, interest for owning French sovereign debt).

France possesses in 2020 the fourth-largest gold reserves in the world.

Macron vowed in May 2023 to build factories, boost job creations and make
France more independent, shaked by pension protests.

### National debt

The Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early
1970s. As of 2021, French government debt reached an equivalent of 118.6% of
French GDP.

Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to
60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and
run public deficits of no more than 3.0% of GDP.

In late 2012, credit-rating agencies warned that growing French government
debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a
future credit downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French
government. In 2012 France was downgraded by ratings agencies Moody's,
Standard & Poor's (S&P), and Fitch to an AA+ credit rating.

In December 2014 France's credit rating was further downgraded by Fitch and
S&P to AA.

Macron, shaken by pension protests, vowed in May 2023 to build factories,
boost job creations and make France more independent.

The Government of France experienced a significant shift in its bond market
position on September 26, 2024, when its bond yield surpassed that of Spain
for the first time since 2007. The yield on 10-year French bonds reached
2.97%, slightly exceeding the yield on Spanish bonds of similar maturity,
despite France's typically higher credit rating. This development raised
concerns among investors about France's ability to manage its public finances
effectively. France's bond yields were reported to be higher than those of
Portugal and approaching levels seen in Italy and Greece, countries
traditionally viewed as having higher economic risks in the Eurozone.

Furthermore, France faces a budget crisis in 2024, with the deficit at risk of
exceeding 6% of GDP, significantly higher than the previous government's
estimate of 5.1%. Newly appointed Finance Minister Antoine Armand and Budget
Minister Laurent Saint-Martin pledged to focus on spending cuts before
considering tax increases to address the fiscal shortfall. Prime Minister
Michel Barnier was tasked with finalizing the 2025 budget within days, amidst
pressure to present realistic plans for deficit reduction.

## Economic sectors

### Industry

A Peugeot 508 SW

In 2019, France was the world's 8th largest manufacturer in terms of value
added, according to the World Bank.

The leading industrial sectors in France are telecommunications (including
communication satellites), aerospace and defence, ship building,
pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, textiles, and
automobile production. The chemical industry is a key sector for France,
helping to develop other manufacturing activities and contributing to economic
growth.

Research and development spending is also high in France at 2.26% of GDP, the
fourth-highest in the OECD.

Industry contributes to French exports: as of 2018, the Observatory of
Economic Complexity estimates that France's largest exports "are led by
planes, helicopters, and spacecraft ($43.8 billion), cars ($26 billion),
packaged medicaments ($25.7 billion), vehicle parts ($16.5 billion), and gas
turbines ($14.4 billion)."

In December 2023, industrial production in France experienced its most
significant change since May of the same year, with a notable increase of
1.1%.

### Energy

France is the world-leading country in nuclear energy, home of global energy
giants Areva, EDF and GDF Suez: nuclear power now accounts for about 78% of
the country's electricity production, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980,
and 75% in 1990. Nuclear waste is stored on site at reprocessing facilities.
Due to its heavy investment in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter
of carbon dioxide among the seven most industrialised countries in the world.
Due to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power, renewable energies have
seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries.

In 2006, electricity generated in France amounted to 548.8 TWh, of which:

  * 428.7 TWh (78.1%) were produced by nuclear power generation
  * 60.9 TWh (11.1%) were produced by hydroelectric power generation
  * 52.4 TWh (9.5%) were produced by fossil-fuel power generation 
    * 21.6 TWh (3.9%) by coal power
    * 20.9 TWh (3.8%) by natural-gas power
    * 9.9 TWh (1.8%) by other fossil fuel generation (fuel oil and gases by-products of industry such as blast furnace gases)
  * 6.9 TWh (1.3%) were produced by other types of power generation (essentially waste-to-energy and wind turbines) 
    * The electricity produced by wind turbines increased from 0.596 TWh in 2004, to 0.963 TWh in 2005, and 2.15 TWh in 2006, but this still accounted only for 0.4% of the total production of electricity (as of 2006).

In November 2004, EDF (which stands for Electricité de France), one of the
world's largest utility company and France's largest electricity provider, was
floated with huge success on the French stock market. However, the French
state still retains 70% of the capital. Other electricity providers include
Compagnie nationale du Rhône (CNR) and Endesa (through SNET).

### Agriculture

Development of agricultural output of France in 2015 US$ since 1961 A wheat
field in Villiers-le-Bâcle. France is the EU's largest agricultural producer.

France is the world's sixth largest agricultural producer and EU's leading
agricultural power, accounting for about one-third of all agricultural land
within the EU. In the early 1980s, France was the leading producer of the
three principal grains of wheat, barley, and maize. Back in 1983, France
produced around 24.8 million tonnes, ahead of the United Kingdom and West
Germany, the next two largest wheat producers.

Northern France is characterised by large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork,
poultry, and apple production are concentrated in the western region. Beef
production is located in central France, while the production of fruits,
vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern France. France is a large
producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry
and fishery industries. The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.

As the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, France ranks just after
the United States. The destination of 49% of its exports is other EU members
states. France also provides agricultural exports to many poor African
countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortages.
Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports.

Exports from the United States face stiff competition from domestic
production, other EU member states, and third-world countries in France. US
agricultural exports to France, totaling some $600 million annually, consist
primarily of soybeans and soybean products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and
consumer products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the
United States are much more high-value products such as its cheese, processed
products and its wine.

The French agricultural sector receives almost €11 billion in EU subsidies.
France produced in 2018 39.5 million tons of sugar beet (2nd largest producer
in the world, just behind Russia), which serves to produce sugar and ethanol;
35.8 million tons of wheat (5th largest producer in the world); 12.6 million
tons of maize (11th largest producer in the world); 11.2 million tons of
barley (2nd largest producer in the world, only behind Russia); 7.8 million
tons of potato (8th largest producer in the world); 6.2 million tons of grape
(5th largest producer in the world); 4.9 million tons of rapeseed (4th largest
producer in the world, behind Canada, China and India); 2.2 million tons of
sugarcane; 1.7 million tons of apple (9th largest producer in the world); 1.3
million tons of triticale (4th largest producer in the world, only behind
Poland, Germany and Belarus); 1.2 million tons of sunflower seed (9th largest
producer in the world); 712 thousand tons of tomatoes; 660 thousand tons of
linen; 615 thousand tons of dry pea; 535 thousand tons of carrot; 427 thousand
tons of oats; 400 thousand tons of soy; in addition to smaller productions of
other agricultural products.

### Tourism

The Palace of Versailles is one of the most popular tourist destinations in
France.

France is the world's most popular tourist destination with more than 83.7
million foreign tourists in 2014, ahead of Spain (58.5 million in 2006) and
the United States (51.1 million in 2006). This figure excludes people staying
less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on
their way to Spain or Italy during the summer.

According to figures from 2003, some popular tourist sites include (in
visitors per year): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Louvre Museum (5.7 million),
Palace of Versailles (2.8 million), Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (2.6
million), Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Centre
Pompidou (1.2 million), Mont-Saint-Michel (1 million), Château de Chambord
(711,000), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000),
Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), Carcassonne (362,000).
However, the most popular site in France is Disneyland Paris, with 9.7 million
visitors in 2017

### Arms industry

Dassault Rafale

The French government is the French arms industry's main customer, mainly
buying warships, guns, nuclear weapons and equipment.

During the 2000–2015 period, France was the fourth largest weapons exporter in
the world.

French manufacturers export great quantities of weaponry to Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Singapore and
many others. It was reported that in 2015, French arms sales internationally
amounted to 17.4 billion U.S. dollars, more than double the figure of 2014.

### Fashion and luxury goods

According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey
(LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales,
selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor. Moreover, France
also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering
SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.

Paris is considered one of the world's foremost fashion capitals, or even "the
world's fashion capital". The French tradition for haute couture has been
estimated to start as early as the era of Louis XIV, the Sun King.

### Education

Education in France is organised in a highly centralised manner, with many
subdivisions. It is divided into the three stages of primary education
(_enseignement primaire_), secondary education (_enseignement secondaire_),
and higher education (_enseignement supérieur_). In French higher education,
the following degrees are recognised by the Bologna Process (EU recognition):
_Licence_ and _Licence Professionnelle_ (bachelor's degrees), and the
comparably named _Master_ and _Doctorat_ degrees.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD
currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of French 15-year-olds as
26th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, near the OECD
average of 493. France's performance in mathematics and science at the middle
school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 Trends in International Math and
Science Study.

60,000 students and over 3,000 researchers

The OECD also found that students in France reported greater concern about
discipline and behaviour at school and in classrooms, much more than the rest
of Europe. This was higher than all OECD countries. School principals reported
higher staff and material shortage in France, higher than OECD averages. About
7% of French teachers believe the teaching profession is highly valued in
France and in society. School principals noted regular acts of violence/
bullying among their students, higher than averages. The time spent of
teaching time spent on keeping classes in good order is one of the largest in
France, among all OECD countries studied. France also has a high drop out
rate.

Pupils can take apprenticeships to enter the labour market with the
Baccalauréat Technologique. It allows pupils pursue short and technical
studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management
etc).

Higher education in France was reshaped by the student revolts of May 1968.
During the 1960s, French public universities responded to a massive explosion
in the number of students (280,000 in 1962–63 to 500,000 in 1967–68) by
stuffing approximately one-third of their students into hastily developed
campus annexes (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses) which
lacked decent amenities, resident professors, academic traditions, or the
dignity of university status. This is why the French higher education economy
performs poorly compared with other high-performing countries such as England
or Australia. France also hosts various catholic universities recognised by
the state, the largest one being Lille Catholic University, as well branch
colleges of foreign universities. They include Baruch College, the University
of London Institute in Paris, Parsons Paris School of Art and Design and the
American University of Paris. Eighteen million pupils and students are in the
education system, over 2.4 million of whom are in higher education.

### Transport

Brest station Two high-speed TGV trains by Alstom SA at Paris-Gare de l'Est

Transportation in France relies on one of the densest networks in the world
with 146 km of road and 6.2 km of rail lines per 100 km2. It is built as a web
with Paris at its centre. The highly subsidised rail transport network makes
up a relatively small portion of travel, most of which is done by car.
However, the high-speed TGV trains make up a large proportion of long-distance
travel, partially because intercity buses were prevented from operating until
2015.

With 3,220 kilometers of high-speed train lines, France boast the 2nd most
expansive network in the world, only after China. Charles de Gaulle Airport is
one of the busiest airports in the world by passenger traffic. Charles de
Gaulle airport is third globally in the number of destinations served, and
first in the number of countries served with non-stop flights.

France also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including Bayonne,
Bordeaux, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Brest, Calais, Cherbourg-Octeville, Dunkerque,
Fos-sur-Mer, La Pallice, Le Havre, Lorient, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, Paris,
Port-la-Nouvelle, Port-Vendres, Roscoff, Rouen, Saint-Nazaire, Saint-Malo,
Sète, Strasbourg and Toulon. There are approximately 470 airports in France
and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have
paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved. The national carrier of
France is Air France, a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic
destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including
Overseas France) across all 6 major continents.

## Foreign investment

According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young, France was in 2020 the
largest Foreign Direct Investment recipient in Europe, ahead of the UK and
Germany. EY attributed this as a "direct result of President Macron’s reforms
of labor laws and corporate taxation, which were well received by domestic and
international investors alike."

France scored 5th in the 2019 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index, up 2 notches
from its 2017 ranking.

## Labour market

According to a 2011 report by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),
France's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is similar to that of the
UK, with just over US$35,000 per head. To explain why French per capita GDP is
lower than that of the United States, the economist Paul Krugman stated that
"French workers are roughly as productive as US workers", but that the French
have a _lower workforce participation rate,_ and "when they work, they work
fewer hours". According to Krugman, the difference is due to the French making
"different choices about retirement and leisure".

La Part-Dieu, Lyon's central business district

France has long suffered a relatively high unemployment rate, even during the
years when its macroeconomic performances compared favourably with other
advanced economies. The employment rate of the French working-age population
is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2020, only 64.4% of the French
working-age population were in employment, compared to 77% in Japan, 76.1% in
Germany, 75.4% in the UK, but the French employment rate was higher than that
of the US, which stood at 62.5%. This gap is due to the low employment rate of
those 15–24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD.

Since his election in 2017, Emmanuel Macron has introduced several labour
market reforms which proved successful in decreasing the unemployment rate
before the global COVID-19 recession struck. In late 2019, the French
unemployment rate, though still high compared to other developed economies,
was the lowest in a decade.

During the 2000s and 2010s, classical liberal and Keynesian economists sought
out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France. Keynesian
economists's theories led to the introduction of the 35-hour workweek law in
1999. Between 2004 and 2008, the government attempted to combat unemployment
with supply-side reforms, but was met with fierce resistance; the _contrat
nouvelle embauche_ and the _contrat première embauche_ (which allowed more
flexible contracts) were of particular concern, and both were eventually
repealed. The Sarkozy government used the _revenu de solidarité active_ (in-
work benefits) to redress the _negative effect_ of the _revenu minimum
d'insertion_ (unemployment benefits which do not depend on previous
contributions, unlike normal unemployment benefits in France) on the incentive
to accept even jobs which are insufficient to earn a living. Neoliberal
economists attribute the low employment rate, particularly evident among young
people, to high minimum wages that would prevent low productivity workers from
easily entering the labour market.

A December 2012 _New York Times_ article reported on a "floating generation"
in France that formed part of the 14 million unemployed young Europeans
documented by the Eurofound research agency. This _floating generation_ was
attributed to a dysfunctional system: "an elitist educational tradition that
does not integrate graduates into the work force, a rigid labour market that
is hard to enter for newcomers, and a tax system that makes it expensive for
companies to hire full-time employees and both difficult and expensive to lay
them off". In July 2013, the unemployment rate for France was 11%.

In early April 2014, employers' federations and unions negotiated an agreement
with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing
an extension of their work time through smartphone communication outside of
official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around
250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their
leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with
staff during this time.

Every day, about 80,000 French citizens commute to work in neighbouring
Luxembourg, making it the biggest cross-border workforce group in the whole of
the European Union. They are attracted by much higher wages for the different
job groups than in their own country and the lack of skilled labour in the
booming Luxembourgish economy.

The background of the 2023 pension reform was about 14% of GDP pension
spending in France compared to OECD average of just over 9%. The aim of the
pension reform was to reduce cost by increasing the minimum legal retirement
age from 62 years to 64 years in 2030. In April 2023, president Emmanuel
Macron signed the pension reforms into law.

## External trade

In 2018, France was the 5th largest trading nation in the world, as well as
the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany). Its foreign trade
balance for goods had been in surplus from 1992 until 2001, reaching $25.4
billion (25.4 G$) in 1998; however, the French balance of trade was hit by the
economic downturn, and went into the red in 2000, reaching a US$15bn deficit
in 2003. Total trade for 1998 amounted to $730 billion, or 50% of GDP—imports
plus exports of goods and services. Trade with European Union countries
accounts for 60% of French trade.

In 1998, US–France trade stood at about $47 billion – goods only. According to
French trade data, US exports accounted for 8.7% – about $25 billion – of
France's total imports. US industrial chemicals, aircraft and engines,
electronic components, telecommunications, computer software, computers and
peripherals, analytical and scientific instrumentation, medical instruments
and supplies, broadcasting equipment, and programming and franchising are
particularly attractive to French importers.

The principal French exports to the US are aircraft and engines, beverages,
electrical equipment, chemicals, cosmetics, luxury products and perfume.
France is the ninth-largest trading partner of the US.

In August 2023, the French current account deficit shrank by €29.7 billion in
the past six months, from −€39.3 billion to −€9.6 billion, primarily due to a
fall in energy prices.

## Regional economy

Nominal GDP per capita, 2015 Eurostat

The economic disparity between French regions is not as high as that in other
European countries such as the UK or Italy and higher than in countries like
Sweden or Denmark, or even Spain. However, Europe's wealthiest and second
largest regional economy, Ile-de-France (the region surrounding Paris), has
long profited from the capital city's economic hegemony.

The most important _régions_ are Île-de-France (Europe's 4th regional
economy), Rhône-Alpes (Europe's 5th largest regional economy thanks to its
services, high-technologies, chemical industries, wines, tourism), Provence-
Alpes-Côte d'Azur (services, industry, tourism and wines), Nord-Pas-de-Calais
(European transport hub, services, industries) and Pays de la Loire (green
technologies, tourism). Regions like Alsace, which has a rich past in industry
(machine tool) and currently stands as a high income service-specialised
region, are very wealthy without ranking very high in absolute terms.

The rural areas are mainly in Auvergne, Limousin, and Centre-Val de Loire, and
wine production accounts for a significant proportion of the economy in
Aquitaine (Bordeaux (or claret)), Burgundy, and champagne produced in
Champagne-Ardennes.

Rhône-Alpes, Europe's 5th largest regional economy. In the past mining, especially coal mining was an important sector, particularly around Saint-Étienne, although this has declined since the 1970s. Rank  | Region  | GDP

## Departments economy and cities

### Departmental income inequalities

Paris is France's largest urban economy (and the world's third).

In terms of income, important inequalities can be observed among the French
départements.

According to the 2008 statistics of the INSEE, the Yvelines is the highest
income department of the country with an average income of €4,750 per month.
Hauts-de-Seine comes second, Essonne third, Paris fourth, Seine-et Marne
fifth. Île-de-France is the wealthiest region in the country with an average
income of €4,228 per month (and is also the wealthiest region in Europe)
compared to €3,081 at the national level. Alsace comes second, Rhône-Alpes
third, Picardy fourth, and Upper Normandy fifth.

The poorest parts of France are the French overseas departments, French Guiana
being the poorest department with an average household income of €1,826. In
Metropolitan France it is Creuse in the Limousin region which comes bottom of
the list with an average household income of €1,849 per month.

### Urban income inequalities

Huge inequalities can also be found among cities. In the Paris metropolitan
area, significant differences exist between the higher standard of living of
_Paris Ouest_ and lower standard of living in areas in the northern
_banlieues_ of Paris such as Seine-Saint-Denis.

For cities of over 50,000 inhabitants, Neuilly-sur-Seine, a western suburb of
Paris, is the wealthiest city in France with an average household income of
€5,939, and 35% earning more than €8,000 per month. But within Paris, four
arrondissements surpass wealthy Neuilly-sur-Seine in household income: the
6th, the 7th, the 8th and the 16th; the 8th arrondissement being the
wealthiest district in France (the other three following it closely as 2nd,
3rd and 4th wealthiest ones).

## Poverty

OECD data from 2021 estimate that 8.4% of the French population lived in
poverty, compared with 18% in the United States, 11.6% in Canada, and 9.8% in
Germany. In 2016, the poverty rate in France stood at 14%, compared to 12.8%
in 2004. The northern districts of Marseille represent one of the poorest and
unequal areas in France, where poor neighbourhoods rub shoulders with
wealthier pockets. The share of people living below the poverty line (949 euro
per month) was 28.8% in 2008 in sensitive urban zones (ZUS) compared to 12% in
the rest of the territory.

In comparison with the average French workers, foreign workers tended to be
employed in the hardest and lowest-paid jobs. They also live in poor
conditions. A 1972 study found that foreign workers earned 17% less than their
French counterparts, although this national average concealed the extent of
inequality. Foreign workers were more likely to be men in their prime working
years in the industrial areas, which generally had higher rates of pay than
elsewhere.

## Wealth

### Overview

In 2010, the French had an estimated wealth of US$14.0 trillion for a
population of 63 million.

  * In terms of aggregate wealth, the French are the wealthiest Europeans, accounting for more than a quarter of wealthiest European households. Globally, the French nation ranks fourth-wealthiest.
  * In 2010, wealth per French adult was a little higher than $290,000, down from a pre-crisis high of $300,000 in 2007. According to this ratio, the French are the wealthiest in Europe. The wealth tax is paid by 1.1 million people in France. Liability to this tax starts from €1.3 million of assets. (There is a discount on the principal residence value.)
  * Almost every French household has at least $1,000 in assets. Proportionally, there are twice as many French with assets of over $10,000 and four times as many French with assets of over $100,000 than the world average.

### Millionaires

France has the third-highest number of millionaires in Europe as of 2017.
There were 1.617 million millionaire households (measured in US dollars)
living in France in 2017, behind the UK (2.225 million) and Germany (1.637
million).

France Macroeconomic indicators

The wealthiest man in France is the LVMH CEO and owner Bernard Arnault.

By 2022, the combined wealth of France's 500 richest people will be worth
1,170 billion euros, or 45% of GDP. In 2009, this figure was just 194 billion,
representing 10% of GDP at the time.
