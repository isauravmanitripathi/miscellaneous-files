The **economy of Portugal** is ranked 36th in the World Competitiveness
Ranking 2024 by Swiss institute IMD. The great majority of the international
trade is done within the European Union (EU), whose countries received 71.4%
of the Portuguese exports and were the origin of 74.6% of the Portuguese
imports in 2020.

The Portuguese currency is the euro (€) and the country has been a part of the
Eurozone since its inception. Portugal's central bank is the _Banco de
Portugal_ , which forms part of the European System of Central Banks, and the
major stock exchange is the Euronext Lisbon. Among OECD nations, Portugal has
a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood
at roughly 24.6% of GDP.

The Portuguese economy has a GDP growth forecast in 2025 of 2%, according to
the IMF World Economic Outlook. The economy's growth has been accompanied by a
continuous fall in the unemployment rate (6.3% in the first quarter of 2019,
compared with 13.9% registered in the end of 2014). Portugal's unemployment
rate stands at 6.4% in January 2025, according to Statistics Portugal.
Portugal ranks third country in Europe with the highest GDP growth for Q3 2024
compared to the same period in 2023 since Portugal registered a GDP growth
rate of 1.9%, while the average GDP growth rate in the EU and in the Eurozone
is 0.9% for Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023.

Portugal’s budget surplus exceeds forecasts by 1 billion euros for the year
2023. Portugal achieved a historic budget surplus of 1.2% of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 2023, exceeding the target of 0.8% that
was expected to reach 2,191 million euros.

These rates mark an inversion from the negative trends caused by the impact of
the 2008 financial crisis in the Portuguese economy that caused it to shrink
for three consecutive years (2011, 2012, and 2013), accompanied by a high
increase of the unemployment rate (that achieved a record of 17.7% in early
2013). The crisis had caused a wide range of domestic problems due to the
levels of public deficit, as well as the excessive debt levels. The problems
culminated in the confirmation from Portugal of a €78 billion financial
bailout from the EU in April 2011, following similar decisions from Greece and
the Republic of Ireland. The government that took office in June 2011 had to
face tough choices in regard to its attempts to stimulate the economy while at
the same time seeking to maintain its public deficit around the EU average.

Portugal is home to a number of notable leading companies with worldwide
reputations, such as The Navigator Company, a major world player in the
international paper market; Sonae Indústria, the largest producer of wood-
based panels in the world; Corticeira Amorim, the world leader in cork
production; Conservas Ramirez, the oldest canned food producer; Cimpor, one of
the world's 10th largest producers of cement; EDP Renováveis, the 3rd largest
producer of wind energy in the world; Jerónimo Martins, consumer products
manufacturer and retail market leader in Portugal, Poland and Colombia; TAP
Air Portugal, highly regarded for its safety record, and one of the leading
airlines linking Europe with Africa and Latin America (especially Brazil).

Education in Portugal has been in gradual modernization and relative expansion
since the 1960s, achieving recognition for its world-standard practices and
trends in the 21st century. According to the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) 2015, the average Portuguese 15-year-old student,
when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is
placed significantly above the OECD's average. Portugal is home to several
world class universities and business schools that have been contributing to
the creation of a number of highly renowned international managers and are
attracting an increasing number of foreign students. Portugal has the highest
emigration rate as a proportion of population in the European Union. More than
two million Portuguese people (20% of the population) now live outside the
country.

## History

### Portuguese Colonial Empire

GDP per capita in Portugal throughout history.

During the Portuguese Empire period, started in the 15th century, until the
Carnation Revolution of 1974, the economy of Portugal was centered in trade
and raw materials related activities within its vast colonial possessions,
mainly in Asia (spices, silk, dyes, porcelain and gems), Africa (ivory,
timber, oil, diamonds and slaves) and South America (sugar cane, dyes, woods,
and gold). The country, with a transcontinental empire with plenty of natural
resources and vast unexploited areas, was among the most powerful nations in
the world.

In 1822, the Portuguese colony of Brazil became an independent country,
however, until 1974, Portugal managed to preserve its colonies/overseas
territories in Africa, which included Angola and Mozambique, territories that
would experience reasonable rates of economic growth until the departure of
the Portuguese in 1975.

The economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the
Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above
the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with
new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in
new capital equipment and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable
consumer goods. The Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created
conditions for the formation of large business conglomerates.

The regime maintained a policy of corporatism that resulted in the placement
of a large part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong
conglomerates, of which, the most important were known as the "seven
magnificent". These Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with
similarities to South Korean chaebols and Japanese keiretsus and zaibatsus.
Among the seven magnificent were the conglomerates founded and held by the
families Champalimaud, Mello (CUF group), Amorim and Santos (Jerónimo Martins
group).

The CUF (Companhia União Fabril) group was the largest and most diversified of
the Portuguese conglomerates. At one point, it became the largest industrial
group in the Iberian Peninsula and one of the five largest in Europe. Its core
businesses included the cement, chemicals, petrochemicals, agrochemicals,
textiles, beer, beverages, metallurgy, naval engineering, electrical
engineering, insurance, banking, paper, tourism and mining. Its main business
activities and corporate headquarters located in mainland Portugal, but it
also included branches, plants and several developing business projects all
around the Portuguese overseas territories, especially in Angola and
Mozambique.

Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance
those located in the city of Covilhã and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain,
glass and crystal (like those of Alcobaça, Caldas da Rainha and Marinha
Grande), engineered wood (like SONAE near Porto), canned fish (like those of
Algarve and the northwest which included one of the oldest canned fish
companies in continuous operation in the world), fishing, food and beverage
producing, tourism (well established in Estoril/Cascais/Sintra (the Portuguese
Riviera) and growing as an international attraction in the Algarve since the
1960s) and in agriculture and agribusiness (like the ones scattered around
Ribatejo and Alentejo – known as the breadbasket of Portugal, as well as the
notorious Cachão Agroindustrial Complex established in Mirandela, Northern
Portugal, in 1963) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early
1970s. In addition, rural areas' populations were committed to agrarianism
that was of great importance for a majority of the total population, with many
families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries
with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.

Besides that, the overseas territories were also displaying impressive
economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the
Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1974), a counterinsurgency war against
independentist guerrilla and terrorism, the overseas territories of Angola and
Mozambique (the largest Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had
continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of their local economies
were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil,
coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals
(like iron and aluminium), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer, cement, fish and
other sea products, beef and textiles.

Labour unions were not allowed and a minimum wage policy was not enforced.
However, in a context of an expanding economy, bringing better living
conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the
colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the
rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo
Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such
as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the
chance to pay social security.

The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity,
reducing fiscal and actuarial imbalance, and achieving more efficiency for the
economy as a whole, for example, by establishing contributions less distortive
to labour markets or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to
increase the investments in the economy.

### 1974

Portuguese population 1961–2003, in thousands, (2005 Data from FAO) with
emigration giving way to retornados ranging from 500,000 to 1 million after
the revolution.

The post Carnation Revolution period was characterized by chaos and negative
economic growth as industries were nationalised and the negative effects of
the decoupling of Portugal from its former colonies were felt. Heavy industry
came to an abrupt halt. All sectors of the economy from manufacturing, mining,
chemical, defence, finance, agriculture and fishing went into free fall.

Portugal found itself overnight going from the country in Western Europe with
the highest growth rate to the lowest – in fact it experienced several years
of negative growth. This was amplified by the mass emigration of skilled
workers and entrepreneurs due to political intimidation, and the costs of
accommodating in Portugal thousands of refugees from the former overseas
provinces in Africa – the _retornados_.

After the Carnation Revolution's turmoil of 1974, the Portuguese economic
basis changed deeply. The Portuguese economy had changed significantly by 1973
prior to the leftist military coup, compared with its position in 1961 – total
output (GDP at factor cost) had grown by 120 percent in real terms. Clearly,
the prerevolutionary period was characterized by robust annual growth rates
for GDP (6.9 percent), industrial production (9 percent), private consumption
(6.5 percent), and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 percent). After the
Carnation Revolution military coup of 1974, by abandoning its moderate-
reformist, pro-democracy posture, the Movimento das Forças Armadas leadership
set out on a course of sweeping nationalizations and land expropriations
during a period known as _PREC_. Wide powers were handed over to the working
class always having the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat in mind.
The lasting effects of this hampered Portugal's economic growth and
development for years to come.

In 1960, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the EC-12 average.
After Salazar's late shift in economic policy toward a more outward-looking,
economically liberal direction due to the influence of a new generation of
technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, by
the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in
1973, on the eve of the revolution, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4
percent of the EC-12 average. In 1975, the year of maximum revolutionary
turmoil, Portugal's per capita GDP declined to 52.3 percent of the EC-12
average. Convergence of real GDP growth toward the EC average occurred as a
result of Portugal's economic resurgence since 1985. In 1991 Portugal's GDP
per capita climbed to 54.9 percent of the EC average, exceeding by a fraction
the level attained just during the worst revolutionary period. Portugal
overtook Greece in terms of GDP per capita in 1992, but fell again below it in
1993. This situation endured until 2013 when Greece was more hardly hit by
economic fallout from debt crisis.

The growth rate of Portuguese merchandise exports during the period 1959 to
1973 was notable – 11 percent per annum. In 1960 the bulk of exports was
accounted for by a few products – canned fish, raw and manufactured cork,
cotton textiles, and wine. By contrast, in the early 1970s (before the 1974
military coup), Portugal's export list reflected significant product
diversification, including both consumer and capital goods. Several branches
of Portuguese industry became export-oriented, and in 1973 over one-fifth of
Portuguese manufactured output was exported.

There was a 16-percentage-point increase in the participation of the services
sector from 39 percent of GDP in 1973 to 55.5 percent in 1990. Most of this
growth reflected the exacerbated proliferation of civil service employment and
the associated cost of public administration, together with the contribution
of tourism services during the 1980s to the detriment of more sustainable and
reproductive activities like manufacturing, exporting and technology/capital-
intensive industries.

### EU membership (1986)

European GDP (PPP) per capita in 2024. Figures from International Monetary
Fund Portugal's GDP growth evolution (PPP) from 1980 to 2014.

Membership in the European Communities, achieved in 1986, contributed to
stable economic growth and development, largely through increased trade ties
and an inflow of funds allocated by the European Union (and before that the
European Communities) to improve the country's infrastructure.

Although the occurrence of economic growth and a public debt relatively well-
contained as a result of the number of civil servants has been increased from
485,368 in 1988 to 509,732 in 1991, which was a much lower increase than that
which will happen in the following years until 2005 marked by irrational and
unsustainable State employment, from 1988 to 1993, during the government
cabinets led by then Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese
economy was radically changed. As a result, there was a sharp and rapid
decrease in the output of tradable goods and a rise of the importance of the
non-tradable goods sector in the Portuguese economy.

After a recession in 1993, the economy grew at an average annual rate of 3.3%,
well above EU averages but well behind the growth of the Portuguese economy
before the military coup of 1974.

In order to qualify for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Portugal agreed
to cut its fiscal deficit and undertake structural reforms. The EMU brought to
Portugal exchange rate stability, falling inflation, and falling interest
rates. Falling interest rates, in turn, lowered the cost of public debt and
helped the country achieve its fiscal targets.

In 1999, it continued to enjoy sturdy economic growth, falling interest rates,
and low unemployment. The country qualified for the Economic and Monetary
Union of the European Union (EMU) in 1998 and joined with 10 other European
countries in launching the euro on 1 January 1999. The three different designs
chosen for the national side of the Portuguese euro coins were drawn by the
artist Vitor Manuel Fernandes dos Santos. The inspiration came from the three
seals of the first king, Dom Afonso Henriques. Portugal's inflation rate for
1999, 2.4%, was comfortably low.

Household debt expanded rapidly. The European Commission, OECD, and others
advised the Portuguese Government to exercise more fiscal restraint.
Portugal's public deficit exceeded 3% of GNP in 2001, the EU's self-imposed
limit, and left the country open to either EU sanctions or tighter financial
supervision. The overall rate of growth slowed in late 2001 and into 2002,
making fiscal austerity that much more painful to implement.

Portugal made significant progress in raising its standard of living to that
of its EU partners. GDP per capita on a purchasing power parity basis rose
from 51% of the EU average in 1985 to 78% in early 2002. By 2005 this had
dropped to 72% (of the average across all of now 25 EU members, including
seven with GDP per capita lower than Portugal) as GDP per capita rose in other
EU countries. Unemployment stood at 4.1% at the end of 2001, which was low
compared to the EU average.

GDP growth in 2006, at 1.3%, was the lowest not just in the European Union but
in all of Europe. In the 2000s, the Czech Republic, Malta and Slovenia
overtook Portugal in terms of GDP per capita. From 2010 until 2012, GDP per
capita (PPP) in Portugal fell below those of Slovakia (in Europe) and
Seychelles (outside Europe). In 2013 it was estimated that the Portuguese GDP
per capita will be similar (within minus or plus US$1,000 per capita) of those
of Greece, Estonia and Lithuania. The GDP per capita fell from just over 80%
of the EU 25 average in 1999 to just over 70% in 2007. This poor performance
of the Portuguese economy was explored in April 2007 by The Economist which
described Portugal as "a new sick man of Europe".

From 2002 to 2007, the unemployment rate increased 65% (270,500 unemployed
citizens in 2002, 448,600 unemployed citizens in 2007). In December 2009,
ratings agency Standard and Poor's lowered its long-term credit assessment of
Portugal to "negative" from "stable", voicing pessimism on the country's
structural weaknesses in the economy and weak competitiveness that would
hamper growth and the capacity to strengthen its public finances and reduce
debt.

However, the Portuguese subsidiaries of large multinational companies ranked
among the most productive in the world, including Siemens Portugal, Volkswagen
Autoeuropa, Qimonda Portugal (before the parent company filed for bankruptcy),
IKEA, Nestlé Portugal, Microsoft Portugal, Unilever/Jerónimo Martins and
Danone Portugal.

Many Portuguese companies have grown and expanded internationally since after
1986. Among the most notable Portugal-based global companies are SONAE,
Amorim, Sogrape, EFACEC, Portugal Telecom, Jerónimo Martins, Cimpor, Unicer,
Millennium bcp, Lactogal, Sumol + Compal, Delta Cafés, Derovo, Critical
Software, Galp Energia, EDP, Grupo José de Mello, Sovena Group, Valouro,
Renova, Teixeira Duarte, Soares da Costa, Portucel Soporcel, Simoldes,
Iberomoldes, Logoplaste and TAP Portugal

The Portuguese Financial crisis was a major political and economic crisis,
related with the European sovereign debt crisis and its heavy impact in
Portugal. The crisis started to be noted in the initial weeks of 2010 and only
began to fade away with the start of the Portuguese economic recovery in the
late 2013. It was the Portuguese economy's most severe recession since the
1970s.

A report published in January 2011 by the _Diário de Notícias_ , a leading
Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that during the period of the Carnation
Revolution, from 1974 to 2010, the Portuguese democratic governments have
encouraged over-expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-
private partnerships. Consequently, numerous ineffective external
consultancy/advising committees and firms were funded, and this facilitated
considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management
and head officers' bonuses and wages. Additionally, a recruitment policy
eventuated that has boosted the number of redundant public servants.

For almost four decades, the nation's economy has also been damaged by risky
credit, public debt creation, and mismanaged European structural and cohesion
funds. Apparently, Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was unable to forecast or
prevent the crisis when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and was later
incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was
on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011. In 2010, acronyms like PIIGS were widely
used by international bond analysts, academics, and the international
financial press when referring to the underperforming economies of Portugal,
Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. The number of civil servants had increased
from 509,732 to 727,701 between 1991 and 2011.

Four factors that heavily contributed to the financial crisis were:

  * The financial collapse of Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) due to a huge amount of toxic credits conceded by the bank in exchange of promises of illegal gains to the administrators, like corporate positions or the acquisitions of assets previously detained by them. The government nationalized the bank in November 2008 and, according to the BPN Inquiry Commission, until 2012, the nationalization of the bank cost 3405 million Euros to the State. In 2010 alone, the bank had an impact of 1803 million Euros in the public accounts, which was equivalent to 1.2% of the GDP.
  * The bankruptcy of the bank Banco Privado Português (BPP), which entailed large costs for the State. This bank was dissolved by Banco de Portugal in April 2010. In 2010 alone, the BPP cost 450 million euros to the taxpayers, consisting in guarantees driven by the State in that year.
  * The budgetary slippage with the Public–private partnerships (PPPs): between 2008 and 2010 the accounts slipped 560.2 million euros, mainly due to the rents paid to road concessions, to which were paid more 425.5 million euros than it was budgeted. In 2011 the slippage in the rents with the road concessions rose 28% to 197.4 million euros above what was budgeted and rose 42.3% to 266.3 million euros above what had been forecasted for 2010. The State spent a total of 896.6 million euros in rents to the road concessions. The rents paid to the PPPs in the health and rail sectors also slipped considerably.
  * The Swaps contracted by State-owned businesses with potential losses higher than 3000 million euros. In 2013, the Portuguese government reserved 898 million euros in the Amending Government Budget to bear the costs of the settlement of these contracts, so those companies can pay the accumulated losses to the financial institutions with which they contracted those swaps. The recipient firms of that support are the Lisbon Metro (548 million euros), the Porto Metro (315 million euros), REFER, whose administrator in the time when those contracts were approved is the former Finance Minister of Portugal, Maria Luís Albuquerque (20 million euros) and Estradas de Portugal (15 million euros).

In April 2011, Portugal confirmed the receipt of a financial bailout from the
IMF and the European Union worth €78 billion ($115 billion, £70 billion),
following Greece and the Republic of Ireland. Some senior German policymakers
publicly stated that emergency bailouts for Greece and future EU aid
recipients should be accompanied by harsh penalties, which caused social
unrest in Ireland and across Southern European countries, germanophobia, a big
increase of euroscepticism and the rise of far-left and far-right parties in
Greece (namely SYRIZA, Golden Dawn, among others), as well as the eurosceptic
Five Star Movement and Lega Nord in Italy.

In May 2007, 65% of the Portuguese tended to trust the EU institutions while
24% tended not to trust them. On the other hand, in November 2012, only 34%
tended to trust them, while 59% tended not to trust them (even so, less
extreme than Greece or Spain, where 81% and 72% tended not to trust them,
respectively). Partly as a result of this disappointed attitude concerning the
EU, Portugal has started to close ties with Africa, Brazil as well as with
other Latin American countries, China, USA, Switzerland and other parts of the
world, which has been reflected both in the investments, in foreign trade, and
even in emigration.

The three-year EU aid program incorporating the €78 billion support package
ended in May 2014. At the time the Portuguese government reaffirmed its
commitment to continue its economic reform, declaring that while the bailout
had allowed the country to put its economy back on track, it still faced
significant challenges.

### Resumption of Portuguese economic growth (2014–present)

The year of 2014 marked the start of the recovery of the Portuguese economy.
Since the third quarter of 2014, the Portuguese economy has been steadily
expanding, with a GDP growth of 0.4% quarterly and 1.5% yearly registered in
the second quarter of 2015. The economic recovery has been accompanied by a
continuous fall in the unemployment rate (8.5% in the third quarter of 2017,
from a high of 17% in 2012). The Government budget deficit has also been
reduced from the 11.2% of GDP in 2010 to 4.8% in 2014.

The International Monetary Fund issued an update report in late June 2017 with
some positive news including a stronger near-term outlook and an increase in
investments and exports. Because of a surplus in 2016, the country was no
longer bound by the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The banking system was more
stable, although there were still non-performing loans and corporate debt. The
IMF recommended working on solving these problems for Portugal to be able to
attract more private investment. "Sustained strong growth, together with
continued public debt reduction, would reduce vulnerabilities arising from
high indebtedness, particularly when monetary accommodation is reduced."

By 2021, Portugal's GDP (PPP) was $36,381 per capita, according to OECD's
report. It was the 4th lowest GDP per capita (PPP) of the eurozone out of 19
members, and the 8th lowest of the European Union out of 27 member-states,
with several former economically disadvantaged Communist Bloc countries which
in the meanwhile had become Eastern European member-states of the EU, nearly
reaching or surpassing Portugal in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita around this
date. Also in 2021, labour productivity (PPP) was the fifth lowest among the
27 member-states of the European Union (EU) and was 35% lower than the EU
average. By 2022, the Portuguese productivity of labour had fallen to the
fourth lowest position among the 27 member-states of the European Union with
only Bulgaria and Greece being clearly inferior to Portugal in that parameter.

At this stage, Portugal had been a net beneficiary to the European Union
budget since it joined the union, then known as EEC, in 1986.

Portugal's GDP growth rate recorded the highest increase in the EU for the
fourth quarter of 2024 as a percentage change compared with the previous
quarter of 2024, according to Eurostat, with +1.5%. Moreover, while GDP per
capita increased in 21 out of 27 countries across Europe, Portugal ranked 5th
with an increase in the quarterly real GDP per capita of 0.68% in 2024.

Portugal also ranks 2nd highest growth in household income rising by 6.7% and
therefore surpassing the OECD average of 0.9%. According to the figures
published in January 2024, by Banco de Portugal, Portugal’s Central Bank,
Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio is declining. Portugal’s total net debt vis-à-vis
the rest of the world decreased from 85.4% of GDP in June 2023 to 82.7% of GDP
in September 2023.

Portugal’s budget surplus exceeded forecasts by 1 billion euros for the year
2023. Portugal achieved a historic budget surplus of 1.2% of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) for the year 2023, exceeding the target of 0.8% that
was expected to reach 2,191 million euros.****The country also ranks 6th EU
country with the highest Gold Reserves by value in euros in 2025, since in Q4
2024, the country holds 382.66 tonnes of gold valued at nearly 35 billion
euros.

## Government sector

### Government expenditure by function

According to Eurostat in 2022, the General Government expenditure by main
function, as a percentage of Total Expenditure, was as follows (compared to
the Eurozone and EU averages):

Function  | Portugal  | Eurozone  | EU   
---|---|---|---  
Social Protection | 39.7% | 39.8% | 39.3%   
Health | 16.2% | 14.9% | 15.5%   
General Public Services | 13.0% | 12.1% | 12.0%   
Economic affairs | 11.0% | 11.5% | 11.8%   
Education | 9.8% | 9.2% | 9.5%   
Public order and safety | 3.7% | 3.4% | 3.4%   
Recreation, culture and religion | 2.1% | 2.2% | 2.3%   
Defence | 1.7% | 2.5% | 2.6%   
Environmental protection | 1.7% | 1.7% | 1.6%   
Housing and community amenities | 1.2% | 2.0% | 2.0%   
  
Also according to Eurostat in 2022, the General Government expenditure by
three of the main functions, as a percentage of GDP, was as follows (compared
to the Eurozone and EU averages):

Function  | Portugal  | Eurozone  | EU   
---|---|---|---  
Social Protection | 17.5% | 20.0% | 19.4%   
Health | 7.1% | 7.9% | 7.6%   
General Public Services | 5.7% | 6.1% | 5.9%   
Detailed description of the functions described above  Government broad objective (division) | Sub-Items   
---|---  
Social Protection | Sickness and disability, old age, survivors, family and children, unemployment, housing, R&D, social exclusion, social protection, non-specified   
General Public Services | Executive and legislative organs, financial and fiscal affairs, external affairs foreign economic aid, basic research, R&D related to general public services, public debt services, transfers of a general character between different levels of government   
Economic Affairs | General economic, labour and commercial affairs, agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, fuel and energy, mining, manufacturing and construction, transport, communication, other industries, related R&D   
Health | Medical products, appliances and equipment, outpatient, hospital and public health service, R&D related to health   
Education | Pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary education, post-secondary non-tertiary education, education nondefinable by level, subsidiary services to education, R&D   
Public Order and Safety | Police, fire-protection services, law courts, prisons, R&D related to public order and safety   
Defense | Military and civil defense, foreign military aid, R&D related to defense   
Recreation, Culture and Religion | Recreational and sporting, cultural services, broadcasting and publishing services, religious and other community services, R&D   
Housing and Community Amenities | Housing development, community development, water supply, street lighting, R&D related   
Environmental Protection | Waste and water waste management, pollution abatement, protection of biodiversity and landscape, related R&D   
  
According to these data, in 2022, Portugal did not present any overspending
neither on the coverage of social risks (social protection and health) and the
slightly high spending on education can be related to a lag between the
average qualifications of Portuguese and their European counterparts,
resulting in an eventual attempt to overcome that lag. There has been a
remarkable progress towards that objective, since the school dropout rate fell
from 43.6% in 2000 to 8.0% in 2023, with Portugal going from the top positions
in 2000 to 13th in 2023 and below the EU average.

The functions where the overspending probably existed were in "general public
services", specifically those related with compensations to employees,
intermediate and final consumptions of the "legislative and executive organs,
financial and fiscal affairs and external affairs", some sub-functions in the
item "economic affairs", since there was a very intensive public works,
notably focused on new motorways, that didn't have a high multiplier effect.
It is also worthy to mention the item "public order and safety" and "defence",
with the compensations to employees and intermediate and final consumptions
being quite higher than the EU average. There seems to have been an
overspending on these functions, since Portugal has had only a very discrete
role in international conflicts and the crime rate is also quite moderate.
There was a big controversy about the purchase of two submarines, whose need
has been questioned. Also the expenses in the sub-section of "outpatient
services", belonging to the "health" function" was very high compared to the
EU average, in opposition to the in-patient "hospital services" where the
expenses were very low in 2011. It is also very relevant to explain the
difficulties in controlling the deficits if we take into account the payments
of interests concerning to loans contracted by the State. Having been stable
around 3.0% of the GDP until 2010, they jumped to 4.2% in 2011.

## Employment and wages

In the fourth quarter of 2024, the unemployment rate was at 6.7%.

The unemployment rate has been continuously falling since the end of 2013,
marking the reversal of the increase of unemployed people trend that had been
recorded since the 2000s. This negative trend had been pronounced with the
impact of the 2008 financial crisis, causing the unemployment rate to climb,
achieving a record of 17.7% in the early 2013.

The decrease of the unemployment is related with the expanding of the
Portuguese Economy registered since the third quarter of 2014 (after shrinking
in 2011, 2012 and 2013), with a yearly GDP growth of 1.5% registered in the
second quarter of 2015. The increase of the number of people that emigrated to
work in other countries also impacted positively the reduction of the
unemployment, this happening specially in 2013, when the labor force decreased
1.6% in the first 9 months of the year. Other factors have also impacted the
decrease, like the methodology used by the Statistics Portugal (for instance,
people doing internships or professional training do not count as unemployed),
the previous heavy loss of jobs, the increase of tourism and the resurgence of
the agricultural sector, where many jobs were created.

Although being both a developed country and a high income country, Portugal
has the lowest GDP per capita in Western Europe and according to the Eurostat
it had the 9th lowest purchasing power among the 27 member states of the
European Union in 2018.

Maria da Conceição Cerdeira, one of the authors of a published research study
made by the Lisbon School of Economics and Management (ISEG), explained that
"in a generic way, there is not a high intensity of work, or a great
psychological pressure" in Portugal, for the mass of common ordinary workers,
unlike what happens in Northern Europe or North America. Less pressure does
not mean, however, a better job. The last European survey of workers,
published in 2007 and which formed the basis of this 2009 research study
showed that Portugal is the 5th European country with lower quality of work. A
study conducted by Harvard Business School, including 9 EU member-countries,
also revealed that Portugal had the 2nd worst managers in that universe, just
above Greece, and below Ireland, Poland, Italy, UK, France, Germany and
Sweden.

The first quarter of 2013 marked a new unemployment rate record for Portugal,
as it reached 17.8 per cent—up from 16.9 per cent in the previous quarter—and
the government predicted an 18.5 per cent unemployment rate in 2014.

Since 2011, the year when Troika arrived to Portugal to apply the bailout
program, around 300,000-360,000 people have left the country, many of them
qualified young people.

In 2014, unemployment was at 13.9%. Around 70,000 jobs were created while
59,000 people became unavailable to work either due to not finding employment
for a long time or emigration. The number of part-time employees who are
considered under-employed and as such, would like to work more hours per day,
is at 251,700 people while 240,300 people are currently inactive (not working,
or studying). The Portuguese Central Bank has stated that one third of jobs
created are intern-ships by the IEFP public institute.

### Wages

The minimum monthly wage in Portugal is 870 euros (from January 1, 2025),
having been previously set at 820 euros. The current minimum wage was
established in December 2024, with the goal of reaching at least 1000 euros by
2028. The minimum wage has been increasing since 2015, where it stood at 505
euros. The average gross wage is 1525 euros (US$1648, nearly the same as the
Czech Republic and Estonia), and the average net wage is 1270 euros (US$1372).
All wages are paid 14 times a year, twelve monthly salary payments plus one
month's pay in the form of a Christmas bonus and one month for a holiday
bonus.

The Portuguese minimum wage, according to article 273 of the Labor Code, is
set after dialogue and negotiations in the Permanent Social Conciliation
Commission, whose value includes the Government and the Employers'
Confederations and Trade Union Confederations. Minimum and average monthly
wages by population employed by others, after income taxes:

Year  | Minimum Wage  | Average Wage   
---|---|---  
2015  | **505** €  | **834** €   
2016  | **530** €  | **846** €   
2017  | **557** €  | **865** €   
2018  | **580** €  | **896** €

2024  | **820** €  | **1,184** €   
2025  | **870** €  | **1,203** € (Q1 2025)  
  
### Graduate unemployment

In 2008, about 8% of the people with a degree were unemployed, and a much
larger proportion was underemployed. This was directly correlated with a
general lack of employability and a student's under-preparation for the
workplace that was seen among many courses in a number of fields that were
offered by certain higher education institutions or departments. The
implementation of the Bologna process and other educational reforms, such as
the compulsory closing of a number of courses, departments, colleges and
private universities after 2005 due to a lack of academic rigour and low
teaching standards, was a completely new approach to tackle the
problem.[_citation needed_]

In 2007 some major private universities were investigated by state agencies
and two were immediately closed. Additionally, a number of degrees of the
public system were also discontinued due to lack of quality, low demand from
potential students or scarce interest from potential employers in these
fields. Secondary and post-secondary non-higher education (intermediate
education— _ensino médio_) that consists of technical and vocational education
has been redeveloped since 2007 through the governmental policies of the _XVII
Governo Constitucional_ (headed by Prime-Minister José Sócrates).[_citation
needed_]

As of March 2014, the graduate unemployment (between 15 and 24 years old) rate
is over 35.4%, which represents an increase when comparing to January and
February 2014. 57% of the Portuguese youth are planning to emigrate to other
countries due to the current (and seemingly the future) fragile state of the
economy.

### Poverty prevention

**History**

Poverty and inequality are significant social problems that Portugal has
attempted to address through various social policy measures. The European
economic crisis has increased the number of households that remain below the
poverty line in Portugal with the greatest affected being the youth due to
high unemployment rates. The current economic crisis experienced across the
globe is the leading cause of income inequalities which lead to poor market
demand in an economy and lower economic growth in Portugal. The minimum wage
policy is aimed at reducing abject poverty and income inequalities in Portugal
which will increase demand and lead to economic stability in the long-term. In
2014 after a four-year freeze Portugal increased their minimum wage by 4%. The
minimum wage policy which came after negotiations with labor organizations and
employers was only possible after substantial recovery of the economy and will
increase the sustainability of the economy with aims at reducing poverty.

**Taxes and transfer payments in Portugal**

Portugal uses tax and transfer payments to increase equality between high-
income earners and the low-income earners in the country. There are
significant progressive characteristics of income taxes in Portugal. The
government tax policy ensures that the high-income earners face higher taxes
in comparison to low-income earners which have enabled the low-income earners
to be able to stimulate demand for goods and services in the country economy.
The high-income earners pay roughly three times the amount paid by the low-
income earners. This approach has been significant in reducing income
inequality through means of redistribution.

**Portuguese GMI**

The Act no. 19-A/96, 29 June created a policy measure by the name of GMI:
Guaranteed minimum income. This decade old means tested approach ensures a
minimum income which grants financial stability for the citizens of Portugal.
The GMI is viewed as a right to the Portuguese people, and proves independent
of market influences. The GMI program aims at providing the low-income earners
who are above 18 years social and economic autonomy to encourage them to
participate in the economic growth of the country. In 2001 reports show that
32 percent of those that were previously approved to benefit from the GMI have
been discontinued after attaining an income above the minimum threshold. This
report shows GMI policy measures as effective in eradicating poverty and
increasing income equality in Portugal

## Economy by sector

Natural resources of Portugal. Fe – iron ore, PY – pyrite, Sn – tin, W –
tungsten, U – uranium, C – coal, L – lignite.

The tertiary sector is presently the most important component of the
Portuguese economy, representing 75.8% of the gross value added (GVA) and
employing 68.1% of the working population. It is followed by the industry
sector, which represents 21.9% of the GVA, proving 24.5% of the jobs.
Fisheries and agriculture – which represented 25% of the economy in 1960 – had
a sharp decrease in its weight, now only representing 2.4% of the GVA, while
employing 7.5% of the working population.

### Natural resources

Forests are the major natural resource of Portugal, covering about 34% of the
country. The most important forest resources are the pine trees (13,500 km2),
cork oaks (6800 km2), holm oaks (5,340 km2), and eucalyptus (2,430 km2). Cork
is a major production, with Portugal producing half of the world's cork.
Significant mining resources are lithium, tungsten, tin, and uranium.

### Agriculture

Vineyards in the Douro Valley.

After years of decline, the agriculture in Portugal had a surprising
resurgence, involuntarily caused by the Portuguese debt crisis, when a number
of highly qualified persons lost their jobs in the tertiary sector and decided
to turn themselves to the development of agricultural businesses, despite
having little or no experience in this sector.

Despite presently representing only a small percentage of the economy, a
considerable part of continental Portugal is dedicated to agriculture. The
South has developed an extensive monoculture of cereals and olive trees and
the Douro Valley of vineyards. Olive trees (4,000 km2; 1,545 sq mi), vineyards
(3,750 km2; 1,450 sq mi), wheat (3,000 km2; 1,160 sq mi) and maize (2,680 km2;
1,035 sq mi) are produced in vast areas. Portuguese wine and olive oil are
especially praised by nationals for their quality, thus external competition
(even at much lower prices) has had little effect on consumer demand.

Portugal is a traditional wine grower, and has exported its wines since the
dawn of western civilization; Port Wine, _Vinho Verde_ and Madeira Wine are
the leading wine exports. Portugal is also a quality producer of fruits,
namely the Algarve oranges, cherries (large production in Cova da Beira and
Alto Alentejo), Oeste region's _pêra rocha_ (a type of pear) and Alcobaça’s
apples (_maçã de Alcobaça_). More recently, niche crops such as blueberry and
raspberry have seen great increase in production, mainly for exporting. Other
exports include horticulture and floriculture products, beet sugar, sunflower
oil, cork, and tobacco.

### Fisheries

Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone of 1,727,408 km2.  

Exclusive Economic Zone

Proposed expansion

The Portuguese fishing industry is fairly large and diversified. Fishing
vessels classified according to the area in which they operate, can be divided
into local fishing vessels, coastal fishing vessels and long-distance fishing
vessels. The local fleet is mainly composed of small traditional vessels (less
than 5 gross tonnage), comprising, in 2004, 87% of the total fishing fleet and
accounting for 8% of the total tonnage. These vessels are usually equipped to
use more than one fishing method, such as hooks, gill nets and traps, and
constitute the so-called polyvalent segment of the fleet.

Their physical output is low but reasonable levels of income are attained by
virtue of the high commercial value of the species they capture: octopus,
black scabbardfish, conger, pouting, hake and anglerfish. Purse seine fishing
is also part of the local fleet and has, on the mainland, only one target
species: the sardine. This fishery represents 37% of total landings.
Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone has 1,727,408 km2, being the 3rd largest of
the EU and the 20th largest in the world.

The coastal fishing fleet accounted for only 13% of vessels but had the
largest GT (93%). These vessels operate in areas farther from the coast, and
even outside the Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone. The coastal fishing fleet
comprises polyvalent, purse seine and trawl fishing vessels. The trawlers
operate only on the mainland shelf and target demersal species such as horse
mackerel, blue whiting, octopus and crustaceans.

The crustacean trawling fishery targets Norway lobster, red shrimp and
deepwater rose shrimp. The most important fish species landed in Portugal in
2004 were sardine, mackerel and horse mackerel, representing 37%, 9% and 8% of
total landings by weight, and 13%, 1% and 8% of total value, respectively.
Molluscs accounted for only 12% of total landings in weight, but 22% of total
landings in value. Crustaceans were 0.6% of the total landings by weight and
5% by value.

### Industry

Oeiras Municipality, in Lisbon metropolitan area, has the headquarters of
several Portuguese subsidiaries of major multinational companies.

The Portuguese industry had a high development, especially after the Second
World War, achieving a peak in 1974, when it represented almost 35% of the GDP
of Portugal and achieved a high degree of diversification.

Presently, the major industries in Portugal include: machinery, electrical and
electronics industries, automotive and shipbuilding industries, injection
moulding, plastics and ceramics industries, textile, footwear and leather
industries, oil refinery, petrochemistry and cement industries, beverages and
food industries and furniture, pulp and paper, wood and cork industries.

Automotive and other mechanical industries such as bicycle industry[5] are
primarily located in and around Setúbal, Porto, Lisbon, Aveiro, Braga and
Mangualde. Coimbra and Oeiras have growing technological-based industries,
including pharmaceuticals and software. Sines has the largest oil refinery in
the country and is a major petrochemical centre, as well as the busiest port
in Portugal. Maia has one of the largest industrial parks of the country,
including noted[_according to whom?_] wood processing and food industries.
Figueira da Foz and Setúbal are major centres of pulp and paper industry.
Marinha Grande is the most reputed glass making centre of Portugal. Leiria,
Oliveira de Azeméis, Vale de Cambra and Viseu, have important light
industries, including injection moulding and plastics. Viana do Castelo and
Setúbal are centres of ship building and repair industries.

Modern non-traditional technology-based industries like aerospace,
biotechnology and information technology, have been developed in several
locations across the country. Alverca, Covilhã, Évora, and Ponte de Sor are
the main centres of Portuguese aerospace industry, which is led by the local
branch of the Brazilian Embraer and by OGMA. Since after the turn of the 21st
century, many major biotechnology and information technology industries have
been founded and are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon, Porto,
Braga, Coimbra and Aveiro.

### Energy

The Serpa solar power plant, one of the largest facilities of this type in the
World.

Since the late 1990s, when wind power was virtually nonexistent in Portugal,
the country has become the 6th producer of this kind of renewable energy.
Along with the traditional Hydroelectric energy, the Portuguese companies,
including the biggest one in the country – EDP – and with the support of the
government have heavily invested in new kinds of renewable energy, from then
on. In 2010, 52% of the energy produced in Portugal was renewable.

In 2013, 61.7% of the energy produced was renewable, including 30.4%
hydroelectric, 24.1% from wind, 5.2% from biomass, 0.9% solar energy and 1.1%
from other renewable energy sources, particularly geothermical energy in the
Azores. Thanks to this energetic strategy, during 2013 Portugal had reduced to
only 5% the energy that it imports. Fossil fuels are still the source of 38.3%
or the energy produced, but the trend is to diminish. In 2013, the increase in
the production of clean energy helped to save 806 million Euros in the imports
of fossil fuels and CO2 emission licenses.

In May 2016, Portugal became the second country in the world to be able to
have all its energy consumption fully covered by renewable energy alone, for
four consecutive days.

In the 1970s, the country abandoned the plan to install nuclear plants and
opted not to invest in nuclear power, so there are no such plants in Portugal.

### Services

The Vasco da Gama Mall, in Lisbon.

The tertiary sector has grown, producing 74.4% of the GDP and providing jobs
for 65.9% of the working population. The most significant growth rates are
found in the trade sector, due to the introduction of modern means of
distribution, transport and telecommunications. Financial tertiary companies
have benefited from privatisation, also gaining in terms of efficiency.

Tourism in Portugal has developed significantly, accounting for 16.5% of GDP
by 2023. In 2023, the number of foreign tourists reached 26.5 million, and,
including domestic tourists, the total is about 47 million.

Some large Portuguese companies in the services' sector have committed
themselves to internationalize their services, like the retailer Jerónimo
Martins, which holds the largest supermarket chain in Poland and is also
investing in Colombia. Worth to notice is also TAP Portugal, a company often
used by transit passengers traveling between Europe, Africa and Latin America
(mainly Brazil), which is particularly regarded by its safety record.

### Companies

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in
Portugal is Services with 224,004 companies followed by Retail Trade and
Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 99,596 and 66,581 companies
respectively. As of 2023, Portugal had 1,526,926 active companies, an increase
of 6.3% compared with the previous year.

## Financial market

Headquarters of the Caixa Geral de Depósitos bank.

In the Portuguese financial system, the major stock exchange is the Euronext
Lisbon which is part of Euronext, the major pan-European group of stock
exchanges. It is supervised and regulated by the Portuguese Securities Market
Commission. The PSI-20 is Portugal's most selective and widely known stock
index. Portugal's central bank is the _Banco de Portugal_ , which is an
integral part of the European System of Central Banks. The largest Portuguese
banks are Banco Comercial Português and the state-owned Caixa Geral de
Depósitos.

Portuguese banks hold strategic stakes in other sectors of the economy,
including the insurance sector. Foreign bank participation is relatively high
as is state ownership through the Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD). Overall,
Portugal's financial system is sound, well managed and competitive, with
shorter-term risks and vulnerabilities quite well contained, and with the
system buttressed by a strong financial policy framework. Despite being
relatively small and concentrated, Portugal's banking system generally
compares well with other European Union (EU) countries in terms of efficiency,
profitability, and asset quality, with solvency also close to European levels.

Across all the financial sub-sectors, and with particular reference to the
larger institutions, supervision of Portuguese financial institutions is
active, professional and well organized. The insurance sector has performed
well, partly reflecting a rapid deepening of the market in Portugal. While
sensitive to various types of market and underwriting risks, both the life and
non-life sectors, overall, are estimated to be able to withstand a number of
severe shocks, even though the impact on individual insurers varies widely.

## Competitiveness

## Domestic issues

  * Forest fires: Like in other countries with very hot summers and seasonal drying of soils and vegetation, every year large areas of the Portuguese forest are destroyed. This has an important impact on the economy because many people and industries depend on forestry related activities. It is also a very dramatic ecological problem and a safety issue for the populations.
  * Portugal's public debt: The Portuguese national debt is around 125% of the GDP as of June 2017. This problem is a threat to the Portuguese economy and the State's financial sustainability.
  * A bloated public sector: The public sector has been generally considered a very large, expensive and inefficient part of the economy. An excess of public employees and useless bureaucracy results in the loss of millions of euros every year. From the _XVI Governo Constitucional_ government, headed by Prime Minister José Durão Barroso, to the _XVII Governo Constitucional_ government, headed by Prime Minister José Sócrates (which tried to create new rules and implement reforms aiming at better efficiency, rationalized resource allocation, fight civil servant excedentary overcapacity (_excedentários_) and less bureaucracy for both citizens and companies – e.g.: _empresa na hora_ [6], _PRACE – Programa de Reestruturação da Administração Central do Estado_ , and SIMPLEX – Programa de Simplificação Administrativa e Legislativa, among others), the "public expenditure problem" has been a major concern in Portugal, however it had little effect, and the country's public debt and deficit were both out of control by 2010. In addition, João Bilhim who directed in 2005 the committee responsible for the Programme for Restructuring the State's Central Administration (PRACE) said to be disappointed with the results of the reforms tried in the mid-2000s.
  * Corruption: According to the 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index of countries published by Transparency International, Portugal had the 32nd lowest level of corruption out of 180 countries. In 2012 it had slumped to a three-way tie for 33rd place. (By comparison, in the same years, the United States ranked 18th and 19th). Nevertheless, corruption has become an issue of major political and economic significance for the Portuguese. The responsible authorities and many civic associations and think tanks are trying to combat corruption before it increases further. Many abusive lobbies and corruption schemes are related to concessions, unclear approvals to contractors and economic groups, or job creation for and commercial agreements with friends and family members, mainly involving the huge public sector and companies. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, as well as a number of politicians with wider responsibilities and power. Notable criminal cases include the _Face Oculta_ , the Oeiras Municipality Mayor Isaltino Morais scandal, the _Apito Dourado_ and the _Saco Azul de Felgueiras_.

## Education, training and research in business and economic sciences

The NOVA SBE, one of the Portuguese world class business schools

There are many higher education institutions awarding academic degrees in
economics and business management, spread across the whole country. Programmes
in management and administration are offered by almost every Portuguese
universities and polytechnics. Programmes in economics are offered by all
public and by some private universities.

Among the largest and most reputed universities, which host an economics
department and develop research on this area, are the University of Lisbon
(through its ISEG - Lisbon School of Economics and Management), the ISCTE –
Lisbon University Institute, the Portuguese Catholic University (through their
Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics and Católica Porto School of
Economics and Management), the University of Porto (through its _Faculdade de
Economia_); the _Universidade Nova de Lisboa_ (through its NOVA SBE – Nova
School of Business and Economics); the Minho University (through its _Escola
de Economia e Gestão_ ); and the University of Coimbra (through its _Faculdade
de Economia_ ). The Financial Times European Business school ranking has
consistently placed the Católica Lisbon School of Business and Economics and
the Nova School of Business and Economics among the top European business and
economics schools.

Besides the higher education institutions, both the Bank of Portugal and the
Statistics Portugal develop lengthy and thoroughly systematic research and
make reports on the Portuguese economy.

## Poverty

2020 Quality of housing in the EU. Portugal had the 2nd worst rate, only below
Cyprus.

In 2012, 45.4% of the population were at risk of poverty before social
transfers, compared to the EU27 average (Croatia not yet included) of 44.1%.
When pensions are included the percentage goes down to 25.2%. 17.5% of the
population were at risk of poverty after social transfers, meaning their
disposable income was below their national at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which
is set at 60% of the national median income per adult equivalent. This is just
above the European Union average of 17%, and compares favorably to other
Southern European countries, such as Spain (22.2%), Italy (19.4%) and Greece
(23.1%).

In January 2015, the poverty stats was updated to 2013: 19.5% of the
population were at risk of poverty after social transfers, meaning their
disposable income was below their national at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which
is set at 60% of the national median income per adult equivalent numbering
nearly 2 million people. According to ISEG economist, Carlos Farinha
Rodrigues, Portugal went back 10 years in terms of social reality, having lost
all the progress that was made until 2009. The risk of poverty after social
transfers for men is 18.9%, 20% for women, 25.6% for children, 38.4% for
monoparental families with at least one child, 15.4% for two parents and one
child and 28.8% for other aggregates with children (elderly, etc.). The
National Statistics Institute made a separate calculation, basing their data
in 2009 in order to have a poverty line that doesn't decrease because of the
income decreases associated with the crisis: with this calculation, the
poverty risk increase is far greater with 17.9% in 2009 to 25.9% 4 years
later. The Prime-Minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, has stated that these numbers
do not reflect the current situation.

Poverty increased in 2022 and affected 17% of the population by then.
According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), the increase in poverty
covered all age groups. Homelessness had increased by 78% in four years:
10,773 homeless people in Portugal, which represents an increase of 78% in
four years. In 2018 there were 6044.

Share (%) of population below the poverty line  Year  | 1995  | 1997  | 1999  | 2001  | 2003  | 2005  | 2007  | 2009  | 2011  | 2013  | 2015  | 2017  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  | 2023

### Food insecurity

In 2005 and 2006, the National Health Survey gathered information on food
security which showed that those making a monthly household income of 251-500
euros made up 37.3% of the food insecure, which was quite contrary to their
counterparts. For instance, those making more than a monthly household income
of 901 euros made up only 15.9% of the food insecure. After the 2010–2014
Portuguese financial crisis, food insecurity escalated and notably affected
those in poorer regions in Portugal—such as Alentejo and Algarve. In the
Algarve region, total food insecurity increased from 56.9% to 77.1% from 2011
to 2012, and the severe food insecurity increased from 13.2% to 41.7%.
Meanwhile, the national food insecurity only increased by 0.5% (48.6% to
49.1%) and the severe food insecurity of other regions, such as Centro and
Norte, started much lower and only increase by approximately 3%. Overall, the
general prevalence of food insecurity from 2011 to 2013 in Portugal was
practically unchanged; however, the less fortunate and poorer regions were
seen to have taken the toll, despite future progress.

More than 12% of the Portuguese population suffered from moderate or severe
food insecurity in 2020 and 2022, a prevalence that puts Portugal above the
average of 8.5% recorded in Southern Europe. Portugal was the sixth country
among the 13 in Southern Europe with the highest percentage in this indicator,
behind Albania (30.2%), North Macedonia (24%), Serbia (14.8%), Bosnia
Herzegovina (13.4%) and Montenegro (12.9%).

### Economic emigration

In 2021, the United Nations revised downwards the estimate of how many
Portuguese lived outside the country: the organization once pointed to 2.6
million in 2020, but corrected it to 2 million, making Portugal the 20th
country in the world with the most emigrants compared to the number of
residents. More Portuguese left the country in 2021 than before the COVID-19
pandemic. An increase in emigration to Northern Europe, Belgium and the
Netherlands was reported. Portuguese emigrants living in France, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom sent the most remittances to Portugal. In 2022,
emigrants living in these countries were responsible for more than half of the
remittances received by Portuguese families. The data released monthly by the
Bank of Portugal on the value of remittances that emigrants send to Portugal
shows an increase of 1.8% in 2021 compared to the previous year, surpassing 3
billion euros. Portugal was one of the EU member states with the highest
figures for remittances received.
