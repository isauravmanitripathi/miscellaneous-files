The **economy of Senegal** is driven by mining, construction, tourism, fishing
and agriculture, which are the main sources of employment in rural areas,
despite abundant natural resources in iron, zircon, gas, gold, phosphates, and
numerous oil discoveries recently. Senegal's economy gains most of its foreign
exchange from fish, phosphates, groundnuts, tourism, and services. As one of
the dominant parts of the economy, the agricultural sector of Senegal is
highly vulnerable to environmental conditions, such as variations in rainfall
and climate change, and changes in world commodity prices.

Dakar, the former capital of French West Africa, is also home to banks and
other institutions which serve all of Francophone West Africa, and is a hub
for shipping and transport in the region.

Senegal also has one of the best developed tourist industries in Africa.
Senegal's economy depends on foreign assistance. It is a member of the World
Trade Organization.

The main obstacles to the economic development of the country are its great
corruption with inefficient justice, very slow administrative formalities, and
a failing education sector.

## History

The GDP per capita of Senegal shrank by 1.30% in the 1960s. However, it
registered a peak growth of 158% in the 1970s, and still expanded 43% in the
turbulent 1980s. However, this proved unsustainable and the economy
consequently shrank by 40% in the 1990s.

### IMF and 1990s economic reforms

Since the January 1994 CFA franc devaluation, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the World Bank, and other multilateral and creditors have been
supporting the Government of Senegal's structural and sectoral adjustment
programs. The broad objectives of the program have been to facilitate growth
and development by reducing the role of government in the economy, improving
public sector management, enhancing incentives for the private sector, and
reducing poverty.

In January 1994, Senegal undertook a radical economic reform program at the
behest of the international donor community. This reform began with a 50%
devaluation of Senegal's currency, the CFA franc, which was linked at a fixed
rate to the French franc. Government price controls and subsidies have been
steadily dismantled as another economic reform.

This currency devaluation had severe social consequences, because most
essential goods were imported. Overnight, the price of goods such as milk,
rice, fertilizer and machinery doubled. As a result, Senegal suffered a large
exodus, with many of the most educated people and those who could afford it
choosing to leave the country.

After an economic contraction of 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important
turnaround, thanks to the reform program, with a growth in GDP averaging over
5% annually during 1995–2004. Annual inflation had been pushed down to the low
single digits.

As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal
is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff
and a more stable monetary policy. Senegal still relies heavily upon outside
donor assistance, however. Under the IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries debt
relief program, Senegal will benefit from eradication of two-thirds of its
bilateral, multilateral, and private sector debt, contingent on the completion
of privatization program proposed by the government and approved by the IMF.

## Current state of economy

Two thirds of Senegalese expect living conditions to improve in the coming
decades.

### External trade and investment

The fishing sector has replaced the groundnut sector as Senegal's export
leader. Its export earnings reached U.S.$239 million in 2000. The industrial
fishing operations struggle with high costs, and Senegalese tuna is rapidly
losing the French market to more efficient Asian competitors.

Phosphate production, the second major foreign exchange earner, has been
steady at about U.S.$95 million. Exports of peanut products reached U.S.$79
million in 2000 and represented 11% of total export earnings. Receipts from
tourism, the fourth major foreign exchange earner, have picked up since the
January 1994 devaluation. In 2000, some 500,000 tourists visited Senegal,
earning the country $120 million.

Senegal's new _Agency for the Promotion of Investment_ (APIX) plays a pivotal
role in the government's foreign investment program. Its objective is to
increase the investment rate from its current level of 20.6% to 30%.
Currently, there are no restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of
capital and income earned, or investment financed with convertible foreign
exchange. Direct U.S. investment in Senegal remains about U.S.$38 million,
mainly in petroleum marketing, pharmaceuticals manufacturing, chemicals, and
banking. Economic assistance, about U.S.$350 million a year, comes largely
from France, the IMF, the World Bank, and the United States. Canada, Italy,
Japan, and Germany also provide assistance.

Senegal has well-developed though costly port facilities, a major
international airport serving 23 international airlines, and direct and
expanding telecommunications links with major world centers.

### Indebtedness

With an external debt of U.S.$2,495 million, and with its economic reform
program on track, Senegal qualified for the multilateral debt relief
initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). Progress on structural
reforms is on track, but the pace of reforms remains slow, as delays occur in
implementing a number of measures on the privatization program, good
governance issues, and the promotion of private sector activity.

Macroeconomic indicators show that Senegal turned in a respectable performance
in meeting IMF targets in 2000: annual GDP growth increased to 5.7%, compared
to 5.1% in 1999. Inflation was reported to be 0.7% compared to 0.8% in 1999,
and the current account deficit (excluding transfers) was held at less than 6%
of GDP.

### Trade unions

Senegalese trade unions include The National Confederation of Senegalese
Workers (CNTS) and its affiliate the Dakar Dem Dikk Workers Democratic Union
(Dakar Public Transport workers), The Democratic Union of Senegalese Workers
(UTDS), The General Confederation Of Democratic Workers Of Senegal (CGTDS) and
the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions of Senegal (UNSAS). Mean wages
were $0.99 per man-hour in 2009.

### Stock exchange

Senegal's corporations are included in the Bourse Régionale des Valeurs
Mobilières SA (BRVM), a regional stock exchange serving the following eight
West African countries, and located in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
