The **economy of South Korea** is a highly developed mixed economy. By nominal
GDP, the economy was worth ₩2.61 quadrillion (US$1.87 trillion). It has the
4th largest economy in Asia and the 13th largest in the world as of 2025.
South Korea is notable for its rapid economic development from an
underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few decades.
This economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which
has allowed it to join the OECD and the G20. It is included in the group of
Next Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the
global economy by the middle of the 21st century. Among OECD members, South
Korea has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social
expenditure stood at roughly 15.5% of GDP. South Korea spends around 4.93% of
GDP on advanced research and development across various sectors of the
economy.

South Korea's education system and the establishment of a motivated and
educated populace were largely responsible for spurring the country's high
technology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an
export-oriented economic strategy to fuel its economy. In 2022, South Korea
was the ninth largest exporter and ninth largest importer in the world. The
Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major
economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.

Renowned financial organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund,
note the resilience of the South Korean economy against various economic
crises. They cite the country's economic advantages as reasons for this
resilience, including low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly
be mobilised to address any expected financial emergencies. Other financial
organisations, like the World Bank, describe South Korea as one of the
fastest-growing major economies of the next generation, along with BRICS and
Indonesia. South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to
avoid a recession during the Great Recession. Its economic growth rate reached
6.2% in 2010, a recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2%
in 2009 during the Great Recession. The South Korean economy again recovered
with a record surplus of US$70.7 billion at the end of 2013, up 47 percent
growth from 2012. This growth contrasted with the uncertainties of global
economic turmoil, with the country's major economic output being technology
products exports.

Despite the South Korean economy's high growth and structural stability, South
Korea is experiencing damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to
North Korea in times of military crises. The recurring conflict affects the
financial markets of its economy. The South Korean economy faces challenges
due to a declining and ageing population, with a fertility rate among the
lowest in the world.

## History

### Overview

Following the Korean War, South Korea remained a country with less developed
markets for a little more than a decade. The growth of the industrial sector
was the principal stimulus to South Korea's economic development. In 1986,
manufacturing industries accounted for approximately 30 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) and 25 percent of the work force. Due to strong
domestic encouragement and some foreign aid, Seoul's industrialists introduced
modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities, increased the
production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and
plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion. As a result,
industry altered South Korea's landscape, drawing millions of labourers to
urban manufacturing centres.

A downturn in the South Korean economy in 1989 spurred by a decrease in
exports and foreign orders caused concern in the industrial sector. Ministry
of Trade and Industry analysts stated that decreased export performance
resulted from structural problems, including an overly strong won, increased
wages and labour costs, frequent strikes, and higher interest rates. The
result was an increase in inventories and cutbacks in production at a number
of electronics, automobile, and textile manufacturers, as well as at the
smaller firms that supplied the parts. Factory automation systems were
introduced to reduce dependence on labour, to boost productivity with a
smaller work force, and to improve competitiveness.

### Colonial period

Japan colonized Korea, officially annexing it on 22 August 1910 as the
Province of Choson. Japan encouraged an inflow of Japanese capital to Korea's
less developed economy. A large majority of major firms in Korea became
Japanese owned and operated as a result, with key positions reserved for
Japanese. Koreans were permitted to work in menial roles under harsh labor
conditions. Most of Korea's coal, iron, and crop production was shipped to
Japan.

### Rapid growth from 1960s to 1980s

Growth of the South Korean economy 1961–2015 Economy of South Korea, compared
to North Korea. North Korea began to lose the economic competition after its
adoption of _Juche_ in 1974.

Following the coup that brought General Park Chung Hee to power in 1961, which
at first caused political instability and an economic crisis, a protectionist
economic policy began, pushing a bourgeoisie that developed in the shadow of
the State to reactivate the internal market. To promote development, a policy
of export-oriented industrialisation was applied, closing the entry into the
country of all kinds of foreign products, except raw materials. Agrarian
reforms were carried out and Park nationalised the financial system to swell
the powerful state arm, whose intervention in the economy was through five-
year plans.

The spearhead was the chaebols, diversified family conglomerates such as
Hyundai, Samsung, and LG Corporation, which received state incentives such as
tax breaks, legality for their exploitation system and cheap or free
financing: the state bank facilitated the planning of concentrated loans by
item according to each five-year plan, and by economic group selected to lead
it.

South Korea received donations from the United States due to the Cold War, and
foreign economic and military support continued for some years. Chaebols
started to dominate the domestic economy and, eventually, began to become
internationally competitive. Under these chaebols, workers began to see their
wages and working conditions improve, which increased domestic consumption. By
the 1980s, the country rose from low income to middle income.

South Korea's real GDP expanded by an average of more than 8 percent per year,
from US$2.7 billion in 1962 to US$230 billion in 1989, breaking the trillion
dollar mark in the early 2000s. Nominal GDP per capita grew from $103.88 in
1962 to $5,438.24 in 1989, reaching the $20,000 milestone in 2006. The
manufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent
in 1987. Commodity trade volume rose from US$480 million in 1962 to a
projected US$127.9 billion in 1990. The ratio of domestic savings to GNP grew
from 3.3 percent in 1962 to 35.8 percent in 1989. In the early 1960s, South
Korea's rate of growth exceeded North Korea's rate of growth in most
industrial areas.

The most significant factor in rapid industrialisation was the adoption of an
outward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. This strategy was particularly
well-suited to that time because of South Korea's low savings rate and small
domestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through labour-
intensive manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a
competitive advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this
process. Through the model of export-led industrialisation, the South Korean
government incentivised corporations to develop new technology and upgrade
productive efficiency to compete the global market. By adhering to state
regulations and demands, firms were awarded subsidisation and investment
support to develop their export markets in the evolving international arena.
In addition, the inflow of foreign capital was encouraged to supplement the
shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve
growth in exports and subsequent increases in income.

Beginning in 1973, South Korea's government used its National Investment Fund
and the Korea Development Bank to invest large amounts of money into what Park
Chung Hee's government viewed as the six strategic industries: steel, non-
ferrous metals, shipbuilding, industrial machinery, electronics, and
petrochemicals. This developmental approach was frequently criticized at the
time from outside Korea, including by the World Bank. The strategy was
successful and ultimately also helped develop companies like Samsung and POSCO
and reduced input costs for production in downstream industries as well.

By emphasising the industrial sector, Seoul's export-oriented development
strategy left the rural sector barely touched. The steel and shipbuilding
industries in particular played key roles in developing South Korea's economy
during this time. Except for mining, most industries were located in the urban
areas of the northwest and southeast. Heavy industries were located in the
south of the country. Factories in Seoul contributed over 25 percent of all
manufacturing value-added in 1978; taken together with factories in the
surrounding Gyeonggi Province, factories in the Seoul area produced 46 percent
of all manufacturing that year. Factories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province
employed 48 percent of the nation's 2.1 million factory workers. Increased
income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a
problem by the 1970s despite government efforts to raise farm income and
improve rural areas

In the early 1980s, in order to control inflation, a conservative monetary
policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted. Growth of the money supply was
reduced from the 30 percent level of the 1970s to 15 percent. During this
time, Seoul froze its budget for a short while. Government intervention in the
economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment
were liberalised to promote competition. To reduce the imbalance between rural
and urban sectors, Seoul expanded investments in public projects, such as
roads and communications facilities, while further promoting farm
mechanisation.

The measures implemented early in the decade, coupled with significant
improvements in the world economy, helped South Korea regain its lost
momentum. South Korea achieved an average of 9.2 percent real growth between
1982 and 1987 and 12.5 percent between 1986 and 1988. The double-digit
inflation of the 1970s was brought under control. Wholesale price inflation
averaged 2.1 percent per year from 1980 through 1988; consumer prices
increased by an average of 4.7 percent annually. Seoul achieved its first
significant surplus in its balance of payments in 1986 and recorded a US$7.7
billion and a US$11.4 billion surplus in 1987 and 1988 respectively. This
development permitted South Korea to begin reducing its level of foreign debt.
The trade surplus for 1989, however, was only US$4.6 billion, and a small
negative balance was projected for 1990.

### 1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis

For the first half of the 1990s, the South Korean economy continued a stable
and strong growth in both private consumption and GDP. During the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, after several other Asian currencies were attacked by
speculators, the Korean won started to depreciate in October 1997. The problem
was exacerbated due to non-performing loans at many of Korea's merchant banks.
By December 1997, the IMF had approved a US$21 billion loan, that would be
part of a US$58.4 billion bailout plan. By January 1998, the government had
shut down a third of Korea's merchant banks. Throughout 1998, Korea's economy
would continue to shrink quarterly at an average rate of −6.65%. and South
Korean chaebol Daewoo was dismantled by the government in 1999 due to debt
problems. General Motors managed to purchase the motors division. Indian
conglomerate Tata Group purchased the trucks and heavy vehicles division of
Daewoo.

Actions by the South Korean government and debt swaps by international lenders
have contained the country's financial problems. Much of South Korea's
recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis can be attributed to labour
adjustments (i.e. a dynamic and productive labour market with flexible wage
rates) and alternative funding sources. By the first quarter of 1999, GDP
growth had risen to 5.4%, and strong growth thereafter combined with
deflationary pressure on the currency led to a yearly growth of 10.5%. In
December 1999, President Kim Dae-jung declared the currency crisis over.

### 2000s

South Korea's economy has moved away from a centrally planned, government-
directed investment model toward a more market-oriented one. These economic
reforms, pushed by President Kim Dae-jung, helped South Korea maintain one of
Asia's few expanding economies,[_citation needed_] with growth rates of 10.8%
in 1999 and 9.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the
slowing global economy, decreased exports, and perceptions that corporate and
financial reforms had stalled.

After the bounce back from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the economy
continued strong growth in 2000 with a GDP growth of 9.08%. However, the South
Korean economy was affected by the September 11 attacks. The slowing global
economy, falling exports, and the perception that corporate and financial
reforms had stalled caused growth to decrease to 3.8% in 2001 Thanks to
industrialisation GDP per hour worked (labour output) more than tripled from
US$2.80 in 1963 to US$10.00 in 1989. More recently the economy stabilised and
maintained a growth rate of between 4–5% from 2003 onwards.

Led by industry and construction, growth in 2002 was 5.8%, despite anemic
global growth. The restructuring of chaebols, bank privatisation, and the
creation of a more liberalised economy—with a mechanism for bankrupt firms to
exit the market—remain an unfinished reform task. Growth slowed in 2003, but
production expanded 5% in 2006, due to popular demand for key export products
such as HDTVs and mobile phones.[_citation needed_]

Like most industrialised economies, South Korea experienced setbacks during
the Great Recession. Growth fell by 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from
the previous quarter, the first negative quarterly growth in 10 years, with
year on year quarterly growth continuing to be negative into 2009. Many
sectors of the economy at the time reported declines, with manufacturing
dropping 25.6% as of January 2009, and consumer goods sales dropping 3.1%.
Exports in autos and semiconductors, two pillars of the economy, shrank 55.9%
and 46.9% respectively, while exports overall fell by a record 33.8% in
January, and 18.3% in February 2009 year on year. As in the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, Korean currency also experienced massive fluctuations,
declining by 34% against the US dollar. Annual growth in the economy slowed to
2.3% in 2008, and was expected to drop to as low as −4.5% by Goldman Sachs,
but South Korea was able to limit the downturn to a standstill at 0.2% in
2009. Despite the Great Recession, the South Korean economy, helped by timely
stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated
for decreased exports, was able to avoid a recession unlike most
industrialised economies, posting positive economic growth for two consecutive
years of the crisis. In 2010, South Korea made an economic rebound with a
growth rate of 6.1%, signaling a return of the economy to pre-crisis levels.
South Korea's exports recorded $424 billion in the first eleven months of the
year 2010, already higher than its export in the whole year of 2008. The South
Korean economy of the 21st century, as a Next Eleven economy, is expected to
grow from 3.9% to 4.2% annually between 2011 and 2030, similar to growth rates
of developing countries such as Brazil or Russia.

business magnates Lee Kun-hee and Chung Mong-koo in 2013

The South Korean government signed the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement
(KAFTA) on 5 December 2013, with the Australian government seeking to benefit
its industries—including automotive, services, and resources and energy—and
position itself alongside competitors, such as the U.S. and ASEAN. South Korea
is Australia's third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner
with a 2012 trade value of A$32 billion. The agreement contains an Investor
State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause that permits legal action from South
Korean corporations against the Australian government if their trade rights
are infringed upon.

The government cut the work week from six days to five in phases, from 2004 to
2011, depending on the size of the firm. The number of public holidays was
expanded to 16 by 2013.

South Korean economy decreased in the first quarter of 2019, which happened to
be its worst drop since the Great Recession. GDP declined a seasonally
adjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter.

South Korea's prices rose more than 6 percent in July compared with last year,
the fastest jump in nearly a quarter century.

In July 2022, South Korea's Consumer price index rose 6.3 percent, the highest
rate since November 1998.

### High-tech industries in the 1990s and 2000s

In 1990, South Korean manufacturers planned a shift in future production plans
toward high-technology industries. In June 1989, panels of government
officials, scholars, and business leaders held planning sessions on the
production of such goods as new materials, mechatronics—including industrial
robotics—bioengineering, microelectronics, fine chemistry, and aerospace. This
shift in emphasis, however, did not mean an immediate decline in heavy
industries such as automobile and ship production, which had dominated the
economy in the 1980s.[_citation needed_]

South Korea relies upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy, with
finished products such as electronics, textiles, ships, automobiles, and steel
being some of its most important exports. Although the import market has
liberalised in recent years, the agricultural market has remained
protectionist due to disparities in the price of domestic agricultural
products such as rice with the international market. As of 2005, the price of
rice in South Korea was four times that of the average price of rice on the
international market, and it was believed that opening the agricultural market
would affect South Korean agricultural sector negatively. In late 2004,
however, an agreement was reached with the WTO in which South Korean rice
imports will gradually increase from 4% to 8% of consumption by 2014. In
addition, up to 30% of imported rice will be made available directly to
consumers by 2010, where previously imported rice was only used for processed
foods. Following 2014, the South Korean rice market will be fully
opened.[_citation needed_]

South Korea today is known as the Launchpad of a mature mobile market, where
developers thrive in a market where few technology constraints exist. There is
a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, using the 4G and
5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea today has the
infrastructure to meet a density of population and culture that has the
capability to create strong local particularities.

### The economy after the COVID-19 pandemic

South Korea faced a turning point in its economy in 2023. With the constant
growth of mainland China's manufacturing industry and the impact of COVID-19,
South Korea's manufacturing sector is experiencing a consistent decline.
According to SP Global, South Korea's export of manufactured goods to mainland
China, one of the biggest trading partners of South Korea, had decreased by
4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and by 31% in January 2023. On the other
hand, their primary electronic manufacturing industry is facing a downturn.
While information and communication technology maintained 34% of South Korea's
total 2022 exports, at the end of the year, it decreased to 24%. The
government had to incur a massive fiscal spending in 2020, leading a rise in
the fiscal deficit as projected in their budget. Moreover, their forecasted
debt-to-GDP ratio jumped to 41.2% of GDP in 2020 from 37.1% of GDP in 2019. In
2021, the government unveiled a $29 billion extra budget to aid small
businesses and boost employment. In 2024, the government forecast a debt-to-
GDP ratio was 47.4% of GDP.

With downturns in many manufacturing industries, South Korea has been facing a
recession. Many economists state the reason for industries' slowdown as
deteriorating global conditions. The inflation rate in South Korea is
regularly rising, and the problems in the domestic economy, such as household
debt, population problems, and productivity problems, are the key fiscal and
monetary factors that hold South Korea's economic growth.

Due to the sudden evolution of COVID-19, private consumption decreased, and a
bottleneck in the supply sector occurred. With this situation, the Bank of
Korea indicated that the consumer inflation rate rose about three percent
after COVID-19 evolved. Assuming that South Korea's interest rate was low
compared to other countries, raising house prices and household debt became
one of the problems in South Korea's economy. To stabilise the inflated
economy, the government has passed the "Korean New Deal Program" to invest 144
billion dollars. This expansionary fiscal policy promoted private consumption
and increased the number of jobs. This expansionary fiscal stimulus is
designed to recover the economic and social impact of COVID-19 from the
existing climate and environmental dangers. The New Deal policy is divided
explicitly into healthcare and green industries.

South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance asserted the New Growth Strategy
4.0 in August 2023. The New Growth Strategy suggests projects for South
Korea's long-term industry growth. The South Korean government advocates these
policies as a New Growth 4.0 project, which aims to generate tangible outcomes
in the future by setting the focus of policy and investments towards emerging
industries. To achieve these goals, the strategy outlines the following key
guidelines:

  1. Foster AI semiconductor industries and build up a collaborative ecosystem between businesses.
  2. Dominate the global market of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry.
  3. Secure Clean Hydrogen Production Technology via Water Electrolysis.
  4. Advance Autonomous Driving Technologies.
  5. Promote the Battery Re-manufacturing and Reuse Markets.
  6. Expand the Private Sector-led My Data Based Services.
  7. Streamline the Ordering Process of Research Equipment or Facilities to Alleviate Administrative Burdens.

Besides this, South Korea is one of the countries with excellent healthcare
systems, biomedical technology, and AI technology. While South Korea's value
in the medical industry is projected at around 6.7 billion dollars, the
medical technology market is projected to reach 11.5 billion dollars. The
annual projected growth rate of the medical industry is over 6%, which
indicates a bright future for the industry. Many economists suggest that by
adopting AI technology, South Korea will be a bio-medical industry-leading
country. An article about the future data-driven healthcare industry in South
Korea suggests that AI technology helps the medical industry provide
customised medical services for patients and can utilise the benefits and
costs.

In April 2025, the incorporation of Korean government bonds into the "World
Government Bond Index" was postponed from November this year to April next
year. After being listed as a prospective candidate for incorporation in
September 2022, it was successfully included in the regular market
classification report in the second half of October 2024.

### Economic inequality

According to data from 2010, low-income earners (those earning 12 million won
or less) make up 37.8% of South Korea's labour force. Conversely, the highest
income earners (those earning 100 million won or more) make up 1.4% of the
labour force.

According to a survey in 2019, among young South Koreans, 89.3% of women and
81.7% of men agreed with the statement that "people born into poverty can
never compete with [those] born into wealth".

## Sectors

### Shipbuilding

Hanwha Ocean Okpo Shipyard in Geoje

During the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea became a leading producer of ships,
including oil supertankers, and oil-drilling platforms. The country's major
shipbuilder was Hyundai, which built a 1-million-ton capacity drydock at Ulsan
in the mid-1970s. Daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in 1980 and finished
a 1.2-million-ton facility at Okpo on Geoje Island, south of Busan, in
mid-1981. The industry declined in the mid-1980s because of the oil glut and
because of a worldwide recession. There was a sharp decrease in new orders in
the late 1980s; new orders for 1988 totaled 3 million gross tons valued at
US$1.9 billion, decreases from the previous year of 17.8 percent and 4.4
percent, respectively. These declines were caused by labour unrest, Seoul's
unwillingness to provide financial assistance, and Tokyo's new low-interest
export financing in support of Japanese shipbuilders. However, the South
Korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early 1990s because
older ships in world fleets needed replacing. South Korea eventually became
the world's dominant shipbuilder with a 50.6% share of the global shipbuilding
market as of 2008. Notable Korean shipbuilders are Hyundai Heavy Industries,
Samsung Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and the now bankrupt STX Offshore &
Shipbuilding.

### Electronics

Electronics is one of South Korea's main industries. During the 1980s through
the 2000s, South Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, and SK led South
Korea's growth. In 2017, 17.1% of South Korea's exports were semiconductors
produced by Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Samsung and LG are also major
producers in electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, display, and
computers.

### Automobile

A Hyundai automobile. The automotive line is a key sector in South Korea's
industry.

The automobile industry was one of South Korea's major growth and export
industries in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the capacity of the South Korean
motor industry had increased more than fivefold since 1984; it exceeded 1
million units in 1988. Total investment in cars and car-component
manufacturing was over US$3 billion in 1989. Total production (including buses
and trucks) for 1988 totaled 1.1 million units, a 10.6 percent increase over
1987, and grew to an estimated 1.3 million vehicles (predominantly passenger
cars) in 1989. Almost 263,000 passenger cars were produced in 1985—a figure
that grew to approximately 846,000 units in 1989. In 1988 automobile exports
totaled 576,134 units, of which 480,119 units (83.3 percent) were sent to the
United States. Throughout most of the late 1980s, much of the growth of South
Korea's automobile industry was the result of a surge in exports; 1989
exports, however, declined 28.5 percent from 1988. This decline reflected
sluggish car sales to the United States, especially at the less expensive end
of the market, and labour strife at home. South Korea today has developed into
one of the world's largest automobile producers. The Hyundai Motor Group is
South Korea's largest automaker in terms of revenue, production units and
worldwide presence.

### Mining

Most of the mineral deposits on the Korean Peninsula are located in North
Korea, with the South only possessing an abundance of tungsten and graphite.
Coal, iron ore, and molybdenum are found in South Korea, but not in large
quantities and mining operations are on a small scale. Much of South Korea's
minerals and ore are imported from other countries. Most South Korean coal is
anthracite that is only used for heating homes and boilers.

In 2019, South Korea was the 3rd largest world producer of bismuth, the 4th
largest world producer of rhenium, and the 10th largest world producer of
sulfur.

### Construction

Breakwater construction in Seosan coast (1984)

Construction has been an important South Korean export industry since the
early 1960s, and remains a critical source of foreign currency and _invisible_
export earnings. By 1981, overseas construction projects, most of them in the
Middle East, accounted for 60 percent of the work undertaken by South Korean
construction companies. Contracts that year were valued at US$13.7 billion. In
1988, however, overseas construction contracts totaled only US$2.6 billion
(orders from the Middle East were US$1.2 billion), a 1 percent increase over
the previous year, while new orders for domestic construction projects totaled
US$13.8 billion, an 8.8 percent increase over 1987. South Korean construction
companies therefore concentrated on the rapidly growing domestic market in the
late 1980s. By 1989, there were signs of a revival of the overseas
construction market: the Dong Ah Construction Company signed a US$5.3 billion
contract with Libya to build the second phase (and other subsequent phases) of
Libya's Great Man-Made River Project, with a projected cost of US$27 billion
when all 5 phases were completed. South Korean construction companies signed
over US$7 billion of overseas contracts in 1989. South Korea's largest
construction companies include Samsung C&T Corporation, which built some of
the highest buildings and most noteworthy skyscrapers such as three
consecutively the world's tallest buildings: the Petronas Towers, Taipei 101,
and the Burj Khalifa.

### Armaments

South Korea's remarkable technological advancements and industrialisation
allowed the country to produce increasingly advanced military equipment.

During the 1960s, South Korea was dependent on the United States to supply its
armed forces, but after the elaboration of President Richard M. Nixon's policy
of Vietnamisation in the early 1970s, South Korea began to manufacture its own
weapons.

Since the 1980s, South Korea has begun exporting military equipment and
technology to boost its international trade. Some of its key military export
projects include the T-155 Firtina self-propelled artillery for Turkey; the
K11 air-burst rifle for the United Arab Emirates; the Bangabandhu class
guided-missile frigate for Bangladesh; fleet tankers such as Sirius class for
the navies of Australia, New Zealand, and Venezuela; Makassar class amphibious
assault ships for Indonesia; and the KT-1 trainer aircraft for Turkey,
Indonesia, and Peru.

South Korea also exports various core components of other countries' advanced
military hardware. Those hardware include modern aircraft such as F-15K
fighters and AH-64 attack helicopters which will be used by Singapore, whose
airframes will be built by Korea Aerospace Industries in a joint-production
deal with Boeing. In other major outsourcing and joint-production deals, South
Korea has jointly produced the S-300 air defence system of Russia via Samsung
Group,[_failed verification_] and will facilitate the sales of Mistral class
amphibious assault ships to Russia that will be produced by STX Corporation.
The deal was cancelled in 2014 due to Russia's actions in Ukraine and the
ships were sold to Egypt instead. South Korea's defence exports were $1.03
billion in 2008 and $1.17 billion in 2009.

### Tourism

In 2012, 11.1 million foreign tourists visited South Korea, making it one of
the most visited countries in the world, up from 8.5 million in 2010. Many
tourists from all around Asia visit South Korea which has been due to the rise
of the Korean Wave (_Hallyu_).

Seoul is the principal tourist destination for visitors; popular tourist
destinations outside of Seoul include the major coastal city of Busan, the
Seorak-san national park, the historic city of Gyeongju, and subtropical Jeju
Island.

## Mergers and acquisitions

Since 1991, there has been a steady upwards trend in South Korean M&A until
2018 with only a short break around 2004. Since 1991, around 18,300 deals in,
into or out of South Korea have been announced, which sum up to a total value
of over 941 bil. USD. 2016 has been the year with the largest deal value
(1,818 in bil. USD) and the most deals (82,3).

Target industries are distributed very evenly with no industry taking a larger
share than 10%. The top three target industries are electronics (9.7%),
semiconductors (9.1%) and metals and mining (7.7%). However, over 51% of the
acquiring companies originate from the financial and brokerage
sector.[_citation needed_]
