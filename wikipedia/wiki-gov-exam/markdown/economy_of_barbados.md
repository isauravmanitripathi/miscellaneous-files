Since the island country's independence in 1966, the **economy of Barbados**
has been transformed from a low-income economy dependent upon sugar production
into a high-income economy based on tourism and the offshore sector. Barbados
went into a deep recession in the 1990s after 3 years of steady decline
brought on by fundamental macroeconomic imbalances.[_citation needed_] After a
painful re-adjustment process, the economy began to grow again in 1993. Growth
rates have averaged between 3%–5% since then. The country's three main
economic drivers are: tourism, the international business sector, and foreign
direct-investment. These are supported in part by Barbados operating as a
service-driven economy and an international business centre.

In June 2018 Barbados announced the default on its bonds, after revealing that
its debt amounted to $7.5 billion (the fourth highest debt in debt-to-GDP
ratio in the world).

## History

### Pre-independence

Since the first settlement by the British in 1625, through history the
**economy of Barbados** was primarily dependent on agriculture. It had been
recorded that minus the marshes and gully regions, during the 1630s much of
the desirable land had been deforested across the entire island. In the 1640s,

Barbados shifted from small-scale mixed crop farming using indentured labor to
large-scale sugar production, introduced by the Jewish community that
immigrated to Barbados when exiled from Dutch Brazil. Land was divided into
large estate-plantations, with a labor-force that was almost entirely made up
of enslaved men and women.

Sugar cane became the driving force in the economy of Barbados. Barbados soon
had built so many windmills that the island had the second highest density of
windmills per square mile in the world, after the Netherlands. For about the
next 100 years Barbados remained the richest of all the European colonies in
the Caribbean region due to sugar. The prosperity in the colony of Barbados
remained regionally unmatched until sugar cane production caught up in
geographically larger countries such as Jamaica and elsewhere. Despite being
eclipsed by larger makers of sugar, Barbados continued to produce the crop
well into the 20th century.

While the emancipation of African slaves in the British Empire in 1833,
nominally liberated the slaves, limited access to education and land kept the
freed as a disenfranchised underclass. As such, emphasis began to be placed on
increased labour rights as well as upward mobility and strong education to
combat plantation living.

During the 1920s, politicians in Barbados started a push for more self-
government. As the 1940s–1950s rolled around, Barbados moved towards
developing political ties with neighbouring Caribbean islands. By 1958 the
West Indies Federation was proposed by the British government for Barbados and
nine other Caribbean territories. The Federation was first led by the Premier
of Barbados, however the experiment ended by 1962. Later, Barbados tried to
negotiate several other unions with other islands, yet it became likely that
Barbados needed to move on. Subsequently, the island peacefully negotiated its
independence with the British Government and the island became independent at
midnight on November 30, 1966.

### Post-independence

After the country became independent of the United Kingdom on 30 November 1966
sugar cane still remained a chief money-maker for Barbados. The island's
politicians tried to diversify the economy from just agriculture. During the
1950s–1960s visitors from both Canada and the United Kingdom started
transforming tourism into a huge contributor for the Barbadian economy. The
man-made Deep Water Harbour port at Bridgetown had been completed in 1961, and
thereafter the island could handle most modern oceangoing ships for shipping
sugar or handling cargoes at the port facility.

As the 1970s progressed, global companies started to recognise Barbados for
its highly educated population. In May 1972 Barbados formed its own Central
Bank, breaking off from the East Caribbean Currency Authority (ECCA). By 1975
the Barbadian dollar was changed to a new fixed / constant rate of exchange
rate with the US$ with the rate being changed to present day US$1 = BBD$1.98
(BBD$1.00 = ~US$0.50).

By the 1980s a growing manufacturing industry was seen as a considerable
earner for the Barbados economy. With manufacturing then being led by
companies such as Intel Corporation and others, the Manufacturing industry
contributed greatly to the economy during the 1980s and early 1990s.

> Under the 1993 Wage and Price Protocol, workers and unions assented to a
> one-time cut in real wages of about 9 percent and agreed to keep their
> demands for future pay raises in line with increases in productivity. Firms
> promised to moderate their price increases, the government maintained the
> parity of the currency, and all parties agreed to the creation of a national
> productivity board to provide better data on which to base future
> negotiations.

In the early 1990s the country's economy was hit hard when real GDP per capita
declined by 5.1% per year between 1989 and 1992 partly due to the 1990 oil
price spike. Barbados entered into an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund financial assistance after a long and hard period of
negotiations between the IMF, the government of Barbados, labour unions and
employers. This led to a protocol on wages and prices in 1993. This helped
prevent an inflationary spiral and restored the island's international
competitiveness thereby leading to a period of long-term economic growth of
2.7% between 1993 and 2000.

As one of the founding members, Barbados joined the World Trade Organization
(WTO) on 1 January 1995. Following this, the Government of Barbados
aggressively tried to make the Barbados economy fully WTO compliant. This led
to the collapse of much of the manufacturing industry of Barbados during the
late 1990s in favour of many companies like Intel and others moving to lower
cost Asian economies. During the late 1990s more companies started to become
interested in Barbados' offshore sector, until it over took sugar as the new
chief money maker. In 1999–2000 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) "blacklist" was circulated with Barbados listed in error.
The negative fallout stymied new investment into Barbados' offshore sector for
nearly two years as Barbados' authorities acted swiftly successfully proving
that Barbados' economy was regulated sufficiently to ward off financial
criminal activity and that it was not a "tax haven" as charged, but instead a
low-tax regime.

As the global recession hit in 2001, the offshore sector in Barbados slightly
contracted further, thereby making tourism the new chief money maker, after
having earlier eclipsed manufacturing and sugar cane. The Government of
Barbados further changed legislation to transform the Barbados economy into
one which fosters investment. This led to several new hotel developments. The
government continues to try maintaining constraint from personal involvement
in the Hotel activity and instead seeks private investment into the Barbados
economy for future growth.[_citation needed_]

Several large hotel projects like the Port Charles Marina project in
Speightstown helped the tourism industry continue to expand in 1996–99, and
more recently the new Hilton Hotel on Needhams Point, Saint Michael in 2005.

Various firms from Wall Street in New York provide routine economic analysis
of the Barbadian economy. This has included such firms as Standard & Poor's
and Moody's.

## Current

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to

---|---  
  
In 2008, Barbados had a GDP (PPP) of $5.466 billion, a GDP (official exchange
rate) of $3.777 billion, a GDP real growth rate of 1.5%, and a per capita PPP
of $19,300. The GDP was composed of the following sectors: agriculture 6%,
industry 16%, and services 78% (2000 est.) In 2001, it had a labor force of
128,500, of which 10% were in agriculture, 15% in industry, and 75% in
services (1996 est.). The unemployment rate in 2003 was 10.7%, and the
inflation rate in 2007 was 5.5%. The Barbadian government had estimated
revenues of $847 million (including grants) in 2000, and expenditures of $886
million. The industrial production growth rate was -3.2%.

Offshore finance and informatics are important foreign exchange earners, and
there is also a light manufacturing sector. The government continues its
efforts to reduce the unacceptably high unemployment rate, which it met in the
1990s, encourage direct foreign investment, and privatise remaining state
owned Crown corporations of Barbados.

The main factors responsible for the improvement in economic activity include
an expansion in the number of tourist arrivals, an increase in manufacturing,
and an increase in sugar production. Recently, offshore banking and financial
services also have become an important source of foreign exchange and economic
growth.

Economic growth has led to net increases in employment in the tourism sector,
as well as in construction and other services sub-sectors of the economy. The
public service remains Barbados' largest single employer. Total labour force
has increased from 126,000 in 1993 to 140,000 persons in 2000, and
unemployment has dropped significantly from over 20% in the early 1990s to
9.3% at the end of 2000.

The Barbados government encourages the development in: financial services,
informatics, e-commerce, tourism, educational and health services, and
cultural services for the future. In 2000 based on Barbados' level of growth –
(at the time) Barbados was supposed to become the world's smallest developed
country by 2008. This had then been restated as being achievable by around
2025.

In May 2018 The Prime Minister Mia Mottley disclosed previously uncovered
financial obligations of the state. The Prime Minister said that the new
government inherited 15 billion Barbados dollars of debt (about 7.5 billion US
dollars). Disclosure of information about the current level of debt has led to
an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 137% to 175%. This is the fourth
value in the world after Japan, Greece, and Sudan. Mia Mottley announced that
new government had no other choice than to ask the IMF to facilitate debt
restructuring. On 5 June 2018 Barbados didn't fulfill its obligation to pay
the 26th coupon on Eurobonds maturing in 2035. According to Cbonds, excluding
the disclosure of the true level of debt, on 7 June 2018 the country had 47
debt issues in circulation totaling 4.425 billion US dollars.

### Wages

Although Barbadians have been ranked as being on the high end of wages
compared to those in the Americas, prices for food, goods and services are
also extremely high. The national minimum wage in Barbados, where wages can be
no less than BBD$8.50 (~ US$4.21) per hour.

In October 2009, Dr. DeLisle Worrell, who later become the replacement
governor of Barbados' Central Bank of Barbados and was executive director of
the Centre for Money and Finance at the UWI Cave Hill Campus revealed that
"the average Barbadian now earns between BBD$200 and BBD$499 per week...."

In 2010 Barbados' population was tabulated at some 281,968 with 80% at working
age yet less than half (106,241 or 38%) were actually registered as employed.

Of these the overall estimates of his finds showed that:

  * There was a roughly 4,400 (1.6%) workers who earned less than BBD$200 (US$100) per week.
  * There were 32,800 (12%) workers who earned between BBD$200 (US$100) and BBD$499 (US$249.50) a week.
  * About 19,100 (7%) workers who earned from BBD$500 (US$250) to BBD$999(US$449.50),
  * 3,700 (1.3%) workers who earned between BBD$1000 (US$500) and BBD$1300(US$650), and
  * 4,100 (1.5%) who earned more than BBD$1300 (US$650) a week.

### Taxation

#### General

In 1997 Barbados implemented a general taxation that covers most items. Known
as the Value-Added Tax ("VAT") it covers almost all items at a 17.5% tax rate
and an 8.75% for hotel accommodations. Exported goods and services,
prescription drugs and a few other specific items are zero rated under the
legislation. The VAT replaced several other taxes such as: the Consumption
Tax, Surcharge, Excise Tax and an Environmental Levy. People operating under
Barbados' VAT regime must be registered for VAT and from 1 December 2010, the
threshold for VAT registration has been BBD$80,000 (previously BBD$60,000).

The island continues to wean off of taxes outside of the VAT system. In 2002
the Barbados government increased the level of people in Barbados who are
exempt from having to pay taxes on their homes. This has steadily grown with
the island heading for a possible rate of 0% taxation in all other areas.

The government has also toyed with the idea of making retirement savings as
tax exempt, to encourage Barbadians to spend less on goods and to encourage
Barbadians to save more income as they once used to.

Building and land owners are liable to land tax on the market value of their
property at rates currently ranging from 0.1 per cent (for valuations from
BBD$150,000) to 0.75 per cent (BBD$1,000,000) on all properties (revalued on a
three-year basis) and there are approximately 115,000 parcels listed.
Exemptions include crown land; University of the West Indies; religious and
benevolent organizations (of which there are many thousands); cemeteries; etc.

Annual Land Tax  
Collections:  | Residential  | Non residential  | Land only  | Total (BBD$ million)   
---|---|---|---|---  
2008  | 37.4  | 45.4  | 27.4  | 110.2   
2009  | 36.9  | 46.3  | 28.1  | 111.3   
2010  | 39.4  | 48.7  | 29.4  | 117.5   
2011  | 41.8  | 45.5  | 31.7  | 119.0   
2012  | 43.8  | 41.5  | 34.6  | 119.9   
  
Personal income tax was lowered from 20% to 17.5% in 2012 and applied on
income of less than BBD$30,000 with a rate of 35% apply on income over
BBD$30,000 and individuals who are both resident and domiciled in Barbados are
taxed on their worldwide income. Generally, persons paying salaries or wages
or other emoluments must withhold tax from remuneration paid to employees
(PAYE). Every individual between the ages of 16 and 65, who is employed in
Barbados must be insured under the National Insurance and Social Security Act
and contributions are determined as a percentage of insurable earnings up to a
maximum of $4,090 per month or $944 per week up to 13.5% (6.5% from employee
and 6.5% from employer).

A new tax, called the Municipal Solid Waste Tax, was introduced and took
effective in 2014.

Tax on Income, Profits and Capital Gains include: Income Tax, Corporate Tax,
Withholding Tax, and Insurance Premium Tax.

Tax on Goods and Services include: Consumption Tax, Excise Taxes, Value Added
Tax, Hotel & Restaurant Tax, Other Taxes on Goods and Services (includes
Licenses, Motor Vehicle Tax, and Selective Taxes on Services).

Corporation tax rates charge 'Regular' companies 25% and 'Small' companies
15%. Employers must remit tax withheld from employees' emoluments to the
Department of Inland Revenue by the 15th day of the next month after they
deducted the tax.

Stamp duty tax is still levied on sale of shares of companies listed on the
Barbados Stock Exchange; on sale of real estate, leases and shares in public
companies; and on mortgages.

#### Bilateral treaties

Barbados has several bilateral tax treaties, mostly aimed at removing double
taxation on companies that operate in the Barbados economy. Since Barbados is
at times considered an expensive place to conduct business, the treaties are
mainly a measure to provide some savings to international businesses that
operate in Barbados. Countries that Barbados has taxation agreements with
include:

  * Austria
  * Botswana
  * Canada
  * China,
  * CARICOM
  * Cuba
  * Finland
  * Luxembourg
  * Malta
  * Mauritius
  * Mexico
  * Netherlands
  * Norway
  * Panama
  * Seychelles
  * Spain
  * Sweden
  * Switzerland
  * The United Kingdom
  * The United States
  * Venezuela

The bilateral tax treaty negotiated with Canada in particular has been a
political-football for the government of that country.[_when?_][_citation
needed_] The treaty was made to allow the profits for IBCs and offshore
banking companies to be repatriated to Canada tax-free after paying taxes in
Barbados. The aim was mainly for companies like the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (CIBC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and Scotiabank, which (along with
Barclays of the United Kingdom), when-combined control a healthy majority of
Barbados' local Commercial Banking sector. In essence the treaty makes the
economy of Barbados almost an unofficial part of the Canadian economy and it
was aimed at allowing Canadian companies to extract profits back to Canada
more easily.[_citation needed_]

## Primary industries

### Agriculture

The cultivation of sugar cane, such as the cane growing in this field outside
Saint Andrew, has always been a big part of the island's economy.

About 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres), or 37.2% of the total land area, are
classified as arable. At one time, nearly all arable land was devoted to
sugarcane, but the percentage devoted to ground crops for local consumption
has been increasing. In 1999, 500,000 tons of sugarcane were produced, down
from the annual average of 584,000 tons in 1989–91. In 2001, sugar exports
amounted to US$22 million, or 8.4% of total exports. Major food crops ("Ground
provisions") are yams, sweet potatoes, corn, eddoes, cassava, and several
varieties of beans. Inadequate rainfall and lack of irrigation has prevented
the development of other agricultural activity, although some vegetable
farming takes place on a commercial scale. Some cotton is also grown in drier
parts of the island, but until cotton can be picked by machine it is unlikely
that output will rise to its former level.

### Animal husbandry

Livestock rearing isn't a major occupation in Barbados, chiefly because good
pasture has always been scarce & imported animal feed is expensive. The island
must import large quantities of meat and dairy products. Most livestock is
owned by individual households. Estimates for 1999 showed 23,000 head of
cattle, 41,000 sheep, 33,000 hogs, 5,000 goats, and 4,000,000 chickens.
Poultry production in 1999 included 9,000 tons of meat and 1,000 tons of hen
eggs. Apart from self-sufficiency in milk and poultry, the limited
agricultural sector means that Barbados imports large amounts of basic foods,
including wheat and meat.

### Fishing

The fishing industry employs about 2,000 persons, and the fleet consists of
more than 500 powered boats. The catch in 2000 was 3,100 metric tons. Flying
fish, dolphin fish, tuna, turbot, kingfish, and swordfish are among the main
species caught. A fisheries terminal complex opened at Oistins in 1983.

### Forestry

Fewer than 20 hectares (49 acres) of original forests have survived the 300
years of sugar cultivation. There are an estimated 5,000 hectares (12,000
acres) of forested land, covering about 12% of the total land area. Roundwood
production in 2000 totalled 5,000 cu m (176,500 cu ft), and imports amounted
to 3,000 cu m (106,000 cu ft). In 2000, Barbados imported $35.3 million in
wood and forest products.

### Mining

Deposits of limestone and coral were quarried to meet local construction
needs. Production of limestone in 2000 amounted to 1.5 million tons. Clays and
shale, sand and gravel, and carbonaceous deposits provided limited yields.
Hydraulic cement production totalled 267,659 tons in 2000, up from 106,515 in
1996.

Oil production is also undertaken in Barbados, with much of the on-shore
activity taking place in Woodbourne, Saint Philip.

## Secondary industries

### Manufacturing

The manufacturing sector in Barbados has yet to recover from the recession of
the late 1980s when many bankruptcies occurred and almost one-third of the
workforce lost their jobs. Today, approximately 10,000 Barbadians work in
manufacturing. The electronics sector in particular was badly hit when the
U.S. semi-conductor company, Intel, closed its factory in 1986. Except for
traditional manufacturing—such as sugar refining and rum distilling—Barbados's
industrial activity is partly aimed at the local market, which produces goods
such as tinned food, drinks, and cigarettes. Many industrial estates are
located throughout the island. A cement factory is located in St. Lucy.

Export markets have been severely damaged by competition from cheaper
Caribbean and Latin American countries. But domestic manufacturing also faces
serious potential problems, as trade liberalisation means that the government
can no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported
goods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete with other regional
economies with lower wage costs and other overhead. The other significant
industrial employer is the petroleum sector. Oil deposits are located in the
southern parishes, but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities. The
island's one small oil refinery closed in 1998 and moved refining to Trinidad
and Tobago, where labour and other costs are cheaper.

### Construction

A construction boom, linked to tourism and residential development, has
assisted the recovery of a large cement plant in the north of the island that
was closed for some years and reopened in 1997.

## Tertiary industries

### Tourism

Tourism is Barbados's crucial economic activity and has been since the 1960s.
At least 10 per cent of the working population (some 13,000 people) are
employed in this sector, which offers a range of tourist accommodations from
luxury hotels to modest self-catering establishments. After the recession
years, tourism picked up again in the mid-1990s, only to face another slowdown
in 1999. This drop was in part due to increasing competition from other
Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic, and in part to a reduction
in visits from cruise ships as they shifted to non-Caribbean routes or shorter
routes such as the Bahamas. Cruise ship visitors totalled 445,821 in 1999, a
reduction from 517,888 in 1997, but stay-over visitors rose to 517,869 in
1999, setting a new record. Overall, the country witnessed over US$700 million
in tourism receipts in 1999.

A problem in Barbados is that tourist facilities are too densely concentrated
on the south coast, which is highly urbanised, while the Atlantic coast—with a
rugged shoreline and large waves—is not suitable for beach tourism. There are
few large brand-name hotels, which makes marketing the island in the United
States difficult. On the other hand, the absence of conglomerates and package
tours results in more direct tourist spending among the general population.

Bathsheba, Saint Joseph

Barbados has numerous internationally known hotels. Time-shares are available,
and many smaller local hotels and private villas that dot the island have
space available if booked in advance. The southern and western coasts of
Barbados are popular, with the calm light-blue Caribbean Sea and their white
and pinkish sandy beaches. Along the island's east coast, which faces the
Atlantic Ocean, there are tumbling waves that are perfect for light surfing.
Some areas remain risky to swimmers due to under-tow currents. The Crane beach
was named one of the top 10 best beaches in the world.

Shopping districts are popular in Barbados, with ample duty-free shopping.
There is also a festive night-life in mainly tourist areas such as the Saint
Lawrence Gap. Other attractions include wildlife reserves (Graeme Hall Nature
Sanctuary), jewellery stores, scuba diving, helicopter rides, golf, festivals
(the largest being the annual Crop Over festival July/Aug), sightseeing, cave
exploration (Harrison's Cave), exotic drinks and fine clothes shopping.

### Informatics

Informatics employed almost 1,700 workers in 1999, about the same number as
the sugar industry. The island has been involved in data processing since the
1980s and now specialises in operations such as database management and
insurance claims processing. Costs in Barbados are higher than elsewhere in
the Caribbean (although still only half of costs in the United States), but
the island offers strong advantages such as a literate English-speaking
workforce and location in the same time zone as the eastern United States.
Despite these factors, employment has fallen in recent years, reflecting
increasing mobility on the part of foreign companies, which frequently
relocate to lower-cost areas.

### Financial services

The international business and financial services sector continues to be an
important contributor to the economy of Barbados. During fiscal year 2010/2011
the sector contributed approximately BBD$186 million in corporate taxes –
almost 60% of the total corporate tax intake. At the end of December 2010,
there were 45 offshore banks, 242 captive insurance companies, 3,065
international business companies, and 408 international societies with
restricted liability. The financial sector is also under threat of sanctions
from the EU and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), both of which have expressed concerns about money laundering, tax
evasion, and other financial improprieties in Caribbean offshore centres.

### Cruise industry

In 2006 the Central Bank governor of Barbados urged the Government to consider
investing in a Barbadian cruise ship company. The government at that time did
not invest in that opportunity but it is unknown if it will in future

### Rum

Barbados has three commercial rum distilleries: West Indies Rum Distillers
Ltd, Mount Gay Rum and Four Square. Mount Gay Eclipse Silver is one of the
most recent Rums created back in 2008. There is also St. Nicholas Abbey, a
smaller boutique operation.

### Retail

The independent Woolworth store on Prince William Henry Street, Bridgetown

Retailing is an important economic activity, especially in Bridgetown where
there are large department stores and supermarkets. In the countryside, most
stores are small and family-run. Some 18,000 people work in the retail sector.
