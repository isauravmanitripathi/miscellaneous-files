The **economy of the Philippines** is an emerging market, and considered as a
newly industrialized country in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2025, the
Philippine economy is estimated to be at ₱28.50 trillion ($497.5 billion),
making it the world's 32nd largest by nominal GDP and 9th largest in Asia
according to the International Monetary Fund.

The Philippine economy is a service-oriented economy, with relatively more
modest contributions from the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. It has
experienced significant economic growth and transformation in the past,
posting one of the highest GDP growth rates in Asia. With an average annual
growth rate of around 6 percent since 2010, the country has emerged as one of
the fastest-growing economies in the world. The Philippines is a founding
member of the United Nations, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation, East Asia Summit and the World Trade
Organization. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is headquartered in the Ortigas
Center located in the city of Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.

The country's primary exports include semiconductors and electronic products,
transport equipment, garments, chemical products, copper, nickel, abaca,
coconut oil, and fruits. Its major trading partners include Japan, China, the
United States, Singapore, South Korea, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany,
Taiwan, and Thailand.

In 2017, the Philippine economy was projected to become the 9th largest in
Asia and 19th largest in the world by 2050. By 2035, the Filipino economy is
predicted to be the 22nd largest in the world.

The Philippines has been named as one of the Tiger Cub Economies, alongside
Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. However, major problems remain,
mainly related to alleviating the wide income and growth disparities between
the country's different regions and socioeconomic classes, reducing
corruption, and investing in the infrastructure necessary to ensure future
growth.

In 2024, the World Economic Forum chief Børge Brende said that “there is a
real opportunity for this country to become a $2-trillion economy.”

## Overview

Historical growth of the Philippine economy from 1961 to 2015

The Philippine economy has been growing steadily over decades and the
International Monetary Fund in 2014 reported it as the 39th largest economy in
the world. The Philippines posted a high GDP growth rate of 7.6 percent in
2022. However, the country is not a part of the Group of 20 nations; instead,
it is grouped in a second tier for emerging markets or newly industrialized
countries.

## Composition by sector

Filipino men at work in Brunei

As a newly industrialized country, the Philippines is still an economy with a
large agricultural sector; however, the country's service industry has
expanded recently. Much of the industrial sector is based on processing and
assembly operations in the manufacturing of electronics and other high-tech
components, usually from foreign multinational corporations.

Filipinos who go abroad to work–-known as Overseas Filipino Workers or
OFWs—are a significant contributor to the economy but are not reflected in the
below sectoral discussion of the domestic economy. OFW remittances is also
credited for the Philippines' recent economic growth resulting in investment
status upgrades from credit ratings agencies such as the Fitch Group and
Standard & Poor's. From more than US$2 billion worth of remittance from
Overseas Filipinos sent to the Philippines in 1994, this significantly
increased to a record US$38.34 billion in 2024 and represented 8.3 percent of
the country's GDP.

### Agriculture

As of 2022[update], agriculture employs 24 percent of the Filipino workforce
accounting for 8.9 percent of the total GDP. The type of activity ranges from
small subsistence farming and fishing to large commercial ventures with
significant export focus.

The Philippines is the world's third largest producer of coconuts, and the
world's largest exporter of coconut products. Coconut production is generally
concentrated in medium-sized farms. The Philippines is also the world's third
largest producer of pineapples, producing 2,862,000 metric tons (2,817,000
long tons; 3,155,000 short tons) in 2021.

Rice production in the Philippines is important to the food supply in the
country and economy. The Philippines is the 8th largest rice producer in the
world as of 2019[update], accounting for 2.5 percent of global rice
production. Rice is the most important food crop, a staple food in most of the
country; it is produced extensively in Central Luzon), Western Visayas,
Cagayan Valley, Soccsksargen, and Ilocos Region.

The Philippines is one of the largest producers of sugar in the world. At
least 17 provinces located in eight regions of the nation have grown sugarcane
crops, of which the Negros Island Region accounts for half of the country's
total production. As of Crop Year 2012–2013, 29 mills are operational divided
as follows: 13 mills in Negros, 6 mills in Luzon, 4 mills in Panay, 3 mills in
Eastern Visayas and 3 mills in Mindanao. A range from 360,000 to 390,000
hectares (890,000 to 960,000 acres) are devoted to sugarcane production. The
largest sugarcane areas are found in the Negros Island Region, which accounts
for 51 percent of sugarcane areas planted. This is followed by Mindanao which
accounts for 20 percent; Luzon with 17 percent; Panay with 7 percent and
Eastern Visayas with 4 percent.

### Automotive and aerospace

The ABS used in Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Volvo cars are made in the
Philippines. Automotive sales in the Philippines increased to 467,252 in 2024
from 429,807 units a year prior. Toyota sells the most vehicles in the country
followed by Mitsubishi, Ford, Nissan, and Suzuki. Honda and Suzuki produce
motorcycles in the country. Since around the 2010s, several Chinese car brands
have entered the Philippine market; these include Chery and Foton Motor.

Aerospace products in the Philippines are mainly for the export market and
include manufacturing parts for aircraft built by both Boeing and Airbus. Moog
is the biggest aerospace manufacturer with base in Baguio; the company
produces aircraft actuators in their manufacturing facility. Total export
output of aerospace products in the Philippines reached US$780 million in
2019.

### Electronics

A Texas Instruments integrated circuit

A Texas Instruments plant in Baguio has been operating for 20 years and is the
largest producer of DSP chips in the world. Texas Instruments' Baguio plant
produces all the chips used in Nokia cell phones and 80% of chips used in
Ericsson cell phones in the world. Toshiba hard disk drives are manufactured
in Santa Rosa, Laguna. Printer manufacturer Lexmark has a factory in Cebu
City. Electronics and other light industries are concentrated in Laguna,
Cavite, Batangas and other Calabarzon provinces with sizable numbers found in
Southern Philippines that account for most of the country's export.

The Philippine Electronics Industry is classified into (73%) Semiconductor
Manufacturing Services (SMS) and (27%) Electronics Manufacturing Services
(EMS) according to SEIPI, the largest organization of foreign and Filipino
electronics companies in the Philippines. Electronic products continued to be
the country's top export with total earnings of US$45.66 billion and accounted
for 57.8 percent of the total export of goods in 2022.

### Mining and extraction

Geothermal power station in Negros Oriental

The Philippines is rich in mineral and geothermal energy resources. In 2019,
it produced 1,928 megawatts (2,585,000 hp) of electricity from geothermal
sources (7.55% of total electricity production). A 1989 discovery of natural
gas reserves in the Malampaya oil fields off the island of Palawan is being
used to generate electricity in three gas-powered plants. Philippine gold,
nickel, copper, palladium and chromite deposits are among the largest in the
world. Other important minerals include silver, coal, gypsum, and sulphur.
Significant deposits of clay, limestone, marble, silica, and phosphate exist.

About 60 percent of total mining production are accounted for by non-metallic
minerals, which contributed substantially to the industry's steady output
growth between 1993 and 1998, with the value of production growing 58
percent.[_citation needed_] Philippine mineral exports amounted to US$4.22
billion in 2020. Low metal prices, high production costs, lack of investment
in infrastructure, and a challenge to the new mining law have contributed to
the mining industry's overall decline.[_citation needed_]

The industry rebounded starting in late 2004 when the Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of an important law permitting foreign ownership of
Philippines mining companies. In 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world
producer of nickel and the 4th largest world producer of cobalt. According to
Philippine Statistics Authority, the total monetary value of four key metallic
minerals which were appraised to Class A namely: copper, chromite, gold and
nickel were valued at US$9.01 billion in 2022. Class A mineral resources are
commercially recoverable that could contribute to economy annually.

### Offshoring and outsourcing

Business process outsourcing (BPO) and the call center industry contribute to
the Philippines' economic growth resulting in investment status upgrades from
credit ratings agencies such as Fitch and S&P. In 2008, the Philippines has
surpassed India as the world leader in business process outsourcing (BPO). The
industry generated 100,000 jobs, and total revenues were placed at US$960
million for 2005. In 2011, BPO sector employment ballooned to over 700,000
people and is contributing to a growing middle class; this increased to around
1.3 million employees by 2022. BPO facilities are concentrated in IT parks and
centers in economic zones across the Philippines: Metro Manila, Metro Cebu,
Metro Clark, Bacolod, Davao City, and Iloilo City; other areas with
significant presence of the BPO industry include Baguio, Cagayan de Oro,
Dasmariñas, Dumaguete, Lipa, Naga, and Santa Rosa, Laguna. The majority of the
top ten BPO firms of the United States operate in the Philippines.

Call centers began in the Philippines as plain providers of email response and
managing services and is a major source of employment. Call center services
include customer relations, ranging from travel services, technical support,
education, customer care, financial services, online business to customer
support, and online business-to-business support. The Philippines is
considered as a location of choice due to its many outsourcing benefits such
as less expensive operational and labor costs, the high proficiency in spoken
English of a significant number of its people, and a highly educated labor
pool.

The growth in the BPO industry is promoted by the Philippine government. The
industry is highlighted by the Philippines Development Plan as among the 10
high potential and priority development areas. The government provides
incentive programs such as tax holidays, tax exemptions, and simplified export
and import procedures. Additionally, training is also available for BPO
applicants.

### Renewable energy resources

Solar module installation in Bulacan

The Philippines has significant potential in solar energy; however, as of
2021[update], most of the domestically produced electricity is based on fossil
fuel resources, particularly coal. The country produced 7,399 megawatts
(9,922,000 hp) of renewable energy in 2019.

On November 15, 2022, the renewable energy sector was granted the ability to
operate with 100 percent foreign ownership, an increase from the previous 40
percent limit. This change allows for the infusion of foreign capital into the
renewable energy (RE) industries. The Department of Energy is targeting an
increase in the share of renewable energy in the country's power generation
mix, aiming for 35 percent by 2030 and 50 percent by 2040, up from the current
22 percent. Danish firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) is investing
US$5 billion to develop three offshore wind energy projects with a potential
capacity of 2,000 megawatts (2,700,000 hp); it will be located in Camarines
Norte and Camarines Sur (1000 MW), Northern Samar (650 MW), Pangasinan and La
Union (350 MW). In 2022, the share of RE in the energy mix was at 22.8
percent.

### Shipbuilding and repair

Hanjin Subic Shipyard in Subic, Zambales

The Philippines is a significant player in the global shipbuilding industry
with 118 registered shipyards in 2021 distributed in Subic, Cebu, Bataan,
Navotas and Batangas. As of 2022, it is the seventh largest shipbuilding
nation by gross tonnage. Subic-made cargo vessels are exported to countries
where shipping operators are based. South Korea's Hanjin started production in
Subic in 2007 of the 20 ships ordered by German and Greek shipping operators.
Bulk carriers, container ships and big passenger ferries are built in the
country's shipyards. General Santos' shipyard is mainly for ship repair and
maintenance.

Surrounded by waters, the country has abundant natural deep-sea ports ideal
for development as production, construction and repair sites. In the ship
repair sector, the Navotas complex in Metro Manila is expected to accommodate
96 vessels for repair. Shipbuilding is part of Philippines' maritime heritage;
employing over 600,000 people and contributing almost 15 percent of revenues
to the ocean-based industries.

### Tourism

Boracay white beach

Tourism is an important sector for the Philippine economy. The travel and
tourism industry contributed 8.6% to the country's GDP in 2023; this was lower
than the 12.7% recorded in 2019 prior to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Coastal
tourism, encompassing beach and diving activities, constitutes 25% of the
Philippines' tourism revenue, serving as its primary income source in the
sector. Popular destinations among tourists include Boracay, Palawan, Cebu and
Siargao. While the Philippines has encountered political and social challenges
that have affected its tourism industry, the country has also taken steps to
address these issues. Over the past years, there have been efforts to improve
political stability, enhance security measures, and promote social
inclusivity, all of which contribute to creating a more favorable environment
for tourism, such as the Boracay rehabilitation.

As of 2023, 6.21 million Filipinos were employed in the tourism industry and
as of 2024, the Philippines generated ₱760.5 billion (US$13.1 billion) in
revenue from foreign tourists, coming mostly from South Korea, the United
States and Japan. The country attracted a total of 5,360,682 foreign visitors
in 2015 through its tourism campaign of _It's More Fun in the Philippines!_ In
2019, foreign arrivals peaked at 8,260,913.The country is also home to one of
the New 7 Wonders of Nature, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National
Park, and one of the New 7 Wonders Cities, the Heritage City of Vigan. It is
also home to six UNESCO World Heritage Sites scattered in nine different
locations, three UNESCO biosphere reserves, three UNESCO intangible cultural
heritage, four UNESCO memory of the world documentary heritage, three UNESCO
creative cities, two UNESCO World Heritage cities, seven Ramsar wetland sites,
and eight ASEAN Heritage Parks.

## Regional accounts

For the year 2022, all economies of the 17 regions in the Philippines recorded
positive growths; Western Visayas had the highest growth (9.3 percent),
followed by Cordillera Administrative Region (8.7 percent), and Davao Region
(8.15 percent).

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), gross regional
domestic product (GRDP) is GDP measured at regional levels. Figures below are
for the year 2019.
