The **economy of Afghanistan** is listed as the 124th largest in the world in
terms of nominal gross domestic product (GDP), and 102nd largest in the world
in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). With a population of around 41
million people, Afghanistan's GDP (nominal) stands at $14.58 billion as of
2021, amounting to a GDP per capita of $363.7 (according to a World Bank
report). Its annual exports exceed $2 billion, with agricultural, mineral and
textile products accounting for 94% of total exports. The nation's total
external debt is $1.4 billion as of 2022.

The Afghan economy continues to improve due to the influx of expats,
establishment of more trade routes with neighboring and regional countries,
and expansion of the nation's agriculture, energy and mining sectors. The
billions of dollars in assistance that came from expats and the international
community saw this increase when there was more political reliability after
NATO became involved in Afghanistan.

Despite holding over one trillion dollars in proven untapped mineral deposits,
Afghanistan remains one of the least developed countries in the world. Its
unemployment rate is over 23% and about half of its population lives below the
poverty line. The main factor behind this has been the continuous war in the
country, which deterred business investors and left much of the population
fighting among each other instead of catching up with the rest of the world.
Afghanistan has long sought foreign investment in order to improve its
economy. The population of Afghanistan increased by more than 50% between 2001
and 2014, while its GDP grew eightfold. After the U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan and the Taliban's return to power in 2021, the Biden
administration decided to confiscate or withhold $9.5 billion worth of assets
from the Afghanistan Central Bank to stop the Taliban from accessing it.

The official currency of Afghanistan is the afghani (AFN), which has an
exchange rate of around 70 afghanis to 1 United States dollar. The country has
a central bank called Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB). A number of local banks also
operate in the country, including the Afghanistan International Bank, Azizi
Bank, New Kabul Bank and Pashtany Bank.

## Economic history

When Afghanistan was ruled by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan (1880–1901) and his son
Habibullah Khan (1901–1919), a great deal of commerce was controlled by the
government. These monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and
the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the
imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. This
slowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western
technologies and manufacturing methods were introduced at the command of the
Afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of
the growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and
other military material. This process was in the hands of a small number of
foreign experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not
possible for non-Afghans, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale
enterprises in Afghanistan during that period.

In the post-independence period, DAB strongly financed the cultivation of
cotton; at one point, the Spinzar Cotton Company in Kunduz Province was one of
the largest providers of cotton in the world, most of which were exported to
the Soviet Union. Fruits were mainly exported to British-controlled India.

The first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was
the Helmand Valley Authority project of 1952, modeled on the Tennessee Valley
Authority in the United States, which was expected to be of primary economic
importance. Glenn Foster, an American contractor working in Afghanistan in the
1950s, stated this about the Afghan people:

> Even though there are masses of people, the country seems able to feed them
> all. Although their diet may not be abundant, you don't see the hunger that
> you do in some countries....

Afghanistan began facing severe economic hardships during the 1979 Soviet
invasion and ensuing civil war destroyed much of the country's limited
infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity.
Eventually, Afghanistan went from a traditional economy to a centrally planned
economy up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy. Gross
domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of
trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal
strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide
ways for the international community to help.

According to the International Monetary Fund, the Afghan economy grew 20% in
the fiscal year ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12
months. The growth was mainly attributed to United Nations assistance.
Billions of dollars in international aid had entered Afghanistan from 2002 to
2021. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to
$6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from opium production. Mean graduate pay
was $0.56 per man-hour in 2010. The country expects to be self sufficient in
wheat, rice, poultry and dairy production by 2026.

The recent reestablishment of the Taliban government led to temporary
suspension of international development aid to Afghanistan. The World Bank and
International Monetary Fund also halted payments during that period. In this
regard, Taliban's spiritual leader Hibatullah Akhundzada stated, "The economy
of a country is built when its people work together and do not rely on foreign
aid[.]" The Biden administration froze about $9 billion in assets belonging to
the DAB, which was intended to block the Taliban from accessing the money. The
recent droughts, earthquakes and floods in the country have created further
adverse economic situation for many residents. The Ministry of Finance has
collected over $2 billion in 2022.

The GDP of Afghanistan is estimated to have dropped by 20% following the
Taliban return to power. Following this, after months of free-fall, the Afghan
economy began stabilizing, as a result of the Taliban's restrictions on
smuggled imports, limits on banking transactions, and UN aid. In 2023, the
Afghan economy began seeing signs of revival. This has also been followed by
stable exchange rates, low inflation, stable revenue collection, and the rise
of trade in exports. In the third quarter of 2023, the Afghani rose to be the
best performing currency in the world, climbing over 9% against the US dollar.

## Agriculture and livestock

Agriculture remains Afghanistan's most important source of employment: 60-80
percent of Afghanistan's population works in this sector, although it accounts
for less than a third of GDP due to insufficient irrigation, drought, lack of
market access, and other structural impediments. Most Afghan farmers are
primarily subsistence farmers.

Afghanistan produced in 2018:

  * 3.6 million tons of wheat;
  * 984 thousand tons of grape (18th largest world producer);
  * 615 thousand tons of potato;
  * 591 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 381 thousand tons of watermelon;
  * 352 thousand tons of rice;
  * 329 thousand tons of melon;
  * 217 thousand tons of apple;
  * 150 thousand tons of onion;
  * 106 thousand tons of maize;
  * 56 thousand tons of barley;
  * 47 thousand tons of peach;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

Afghanistan produces around 1.5 million tons of fresh fruits annually, which
could be increased significantly. It is known for producing some of the finest
fruits, especially pomegranates and grapes as well as sweet melons and
mulberries. Other fruits grown in the country include apples, apricots,
cherries, figs, kiwi, oranges, peaches, pears, persimmons, plums, and
strawberries. As of 2022, farming is entirely organic and steadily increasing.
There are over 5,000 greenhouses in the country.

The northern and western Afghan provinces are long known for pistachio
cultivation. In recent years, farmers in the southern provinces began growing
American pistachio trees. Provinces in the east of the country, particularly
Khost and Paktia, are famous for pine nuts. The northern and central provinces
are also famous for almonds and walnuts, as well as for _kangina_ , a method
of storing grapes in mud. The Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan is known
for growing superior quality potatoes, which produced 370,000 tons in 2020.
Nangarhar, Kunar and Laghman are the only provinces in the country where large
farms of grapefruits, lemons, limes, and oranges can be found. Nangarhar also
has farms of dates, peanuts, olives, and sugarcane. Cultivation of these
products have spread to other provinces of the country. Other agricultural
products such as avocados, bananas and pineapples have recently been planted
in the provinces of Balkh, Helmand, Nangarhar, and Paktia.

Afghanistan is listed as the 54th largest vegetables producing country. Most
of its vegetables are for domestic consumption and include beans, broccoli,
cabbages, carrots, cauliflowers, chickpeas, coriander, corns, cucumbers,
eggplants, leeks, lettuces, okras, onions, peppers, potatoes, pumpkins,
radishes, rhubarb, spinach, tomatoes, turnips, and zucchinis. Wheat and cereal
production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. The nation is
nearing self-sufficiency in grain production. It requires an additional 1 to 3
million tons of wheat to become self-sufficient, which is predicted to be
accomplished in the near future.

Nangarhar Province

Livestock in Afghanistan mainly include cattle, sheep, and goats. Poultry
farming is widespread in the warmer parts of the country. The Habib Hassam
Poultry Complex is located in Jalalabad.

Arable land in Afghanistan was reported to be over 7.5 million hectares. Wheat
production had stood at about 5 million tonnes in 2015, nurseries held 119,000
hectares of land, and grape production is at 615,000 tonnes. It was reported
that cotton production has jumped to 500,000 tons. Around 3,200 ha (7,900
acres) of farm land in Afghanistan is used to cultivate saffron, mostly in the
west, north and south of the country. Sugarcane is currently grown on 1,750 ha
(4,300 acres) of land, and asafoetida on nearly 980 ha (2,400 acres) of land.

### Forestry

According to a 2010 report, only about 2.1% (or 1,350,000 ha (3,300,000
acres)) of Afghanistan is forested. This can be significantly increased by
planting trees, including in the non-rocky hills and mountains which trap
underground water. Some steps have been taken in recent years in planting
trees in the urban areas all across Afghanistan. Even the Taliban spiritual
leader has recently called for planting more trees. Felling has been made
illegal nationally.

### Fishing

Afghanistan is landlocked with its citizens having no direct access to an
ocean. The country has many lakes, ponds, reservoirs, rivers, springs,
streams, etc., which make it a suitable climate for fish farming.
Historically, fish constituted a smaller part of the Afghan diet because of
the unavailability of modern fish farms. Fishing only took place in the lakes
and rivers, particularly in the Amu, Helmand and Kabul rivers. Consumption of
fish has increased sharply due to the establishment of many fish farms. There
are over 2,600 of them in the country. The largest ones are at the national
reservoirs, which supply fish eggs to smaller fish farms.

## Trade and industry

Afghanistan's geographical location makes it economically secured. The Lapis
Lazuli corridor connects Afghanistan with Turkmenistan and ultimately ends
somewhere in Europe. Other such trade routes connect Afghanistan with
neighboring Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The country also has
direct trade with China and India via air corridor. It has four international
airports, which include: Kabul International Airport in the capital city;
Mazar-e Sharif International Airport in the north of the country; Herat
International Airport in the west; and the Ahmad Shah Baba International
Airport in Kandahar. It also has about 24 domestic airports. The major
airlines of the country include Ariana Afghan Airlines and Kam Air. Its
national rail network is slowly expanding to connect Central Asia with
Pakistan and Iran. In addition to Central Asia, imported goods also enter by
rail from neighboring Iran and China.

The Afghanistan–Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) allows Afghan and
Pakistani cargo trucks to transit goods within both nations. This revised US-
sponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to
India via Pakistan up to the Wagah crossing point. There are over a dozen
official border crossing points all around Afghanistan. They include Abu Nasir
Port in Farah Province, Ai-Khanoum in Takhar Province, Angur Ada in Paktika
Province, Aqina in Faryab Province, Dand-aw-Patan in Paktia Province, Ghulam
Khan in Khost Province, Hairatan in Balkh Province, Ishkashim in Badakhshan
Province, Islam Qala in Herat Province, Sher Khan Bandar in Kunduz Province,
Torghundi in Herat Province, Torkham in Nangarhar Province, Spin Boldak in
Kandahar Province, and Zaranj in Nimruz Province. The country also has legal
access to two major seaports in Pakistan, the Gwadar Port in Balochistan and
the Port Qasim in Sindh. Afghanistan also has legal access to major seaports
in Iran, which include the one in Bandar Abbas in the Persian Gulf and the
Chabahar Port in the Gulf of Oman.

Due to lack of major rail service, transport in Afghanistan is mostly done by
road and air.

Afghanistan is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, which include
extensive deposits of barites, chromite, coal, copper, gold, gemstone, iron
ore, lead, lithium, marble, natural gas, petroleum, salt, sulfur, talc,
uranium, and zinc. Rare-earth elements can be found all over the country. In
2006, a U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Afghanistan has as much as
1,000×10~~^~~ 6 m3 (36×10~~^~~ 9 cu ft) of natural gas, 570×10~~^~~ 6 m3 (3.6
Gbbl) of oil and condensate reserves. According to a 2007 assessment,
Afghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral
resources. Geologists also found indications of abundant deposits of colored
stones and gemstones, including emerald, garnet, kunzite, lapis lazuli,
peridot, ruby, sapphire, spinel, and tourmaline.

It is claimed that Afghanistan has at least $1 trillion in untapped mineral
deposits. A memo from the Pentagon stated that Afghanistan could become the
"Saudi Arabia of lithium". Some believe that the untapped minerals are worth
up to $3 trillion. The Khanashin carbonatites in the Helmand Province of the
country have an estimated 1 million metric tonnes of rare earth elements.

Afghanistan currently has a copper mining deal with China Metallurgical Group
Corporation, which involves the investment of $2.8 billion by China and an
annual income of about $400 million to the Afghan government. The country's
Ainak copper mine, located in Logar Province, is one of the biggest in the
world. It is estimated to hold at least 11 million tonnes or US$33 billion
worth of copper.

The previous government has signed a 30-year contract with investment group
Centar and its operating company, Afghan Gold and Minerals Co., to explore and
develop a copper mining operation in Balkhab District in Sar-e Pol Province,
including a gold mining operation in Badakhshan Province. The copper contract
involved a $56 million investment and the gold contract a $22 million
investment.

The country's other recently announced treasure is the Hajigak iron mine,
located 210 km (130 mi) west of Kabul and is believed to hold an estimated 1.8
billion to 2 billion metric tons of the mineral used to make steel. The
country also has a number of coal mines.

Afghanistan's important resource in the past has been natural gas, which was
first tapped in 1967. During the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a
year in export revenues (56% of the total). About 90% of these exports went to
the Soviet Union to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal
of Soviet troops in 1989, the natural gas fields were capped to prevent
sabotage by criminals. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2×10~~^~~ 6
m3 (290×10~~^~~ 6 cu ft) per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 m3
(21×10~~^~~ 6 cu ft) in 2001. Production of natural gas was restored during
the Karzai administration in 2010.

It is predicted that by pumping-out its own oil reserves, Afghanistan will no
longer be importing oil products after 2026. Originally, the Karzai
administration and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a
contract for the development of three oil fields in the northern provinces of
Sar-e Pol, Jowzjan and Faryab. It was later reported that CNPC began
extracting 240,000 m3 (1.5×10~~^~~ 6 bbl) of oil annually. In early 2023, the
Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company signed a similar contract with
the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Russia had also found interest in oil and
gas supply to Afghanistan.

## Economic development and recovery

From left to right: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Iranian President
Hassan Rouhani, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, during the signing of the
Chabahar Port transit agreement in May 2016

Afghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s.
The government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a
university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent
students abroad for education. In 1952 it created the Helmand Valley Authority
to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys
through irrigation and land development, a scheme which remains one of the
country's most important capital resources.

In 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious
development plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results
due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a
shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.

Afghan United Bank

Da Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation. The "afghani"
(AFN) is the national currency, which has an exchange rate of around 70
afghanis to 1 US dollar. There are over a dozen different banks operating in
the country, including Afghanistan International Bank, Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank,
Pashtany Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and First Micro Finance Bank. Cash is
still widely used for most transactions. A new law on private investment
provides three to seven-year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four-
year exemption from exports tariffs and duties. Improvements to the business-
enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom
investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.

Afghanistan is a member of ECO, OIC, SAARC, and WTO. It has an observer status
in the SCO. It seeks to complete the so-called _New Silk Road_ trade project,
which is aimed to connecting South Asia with Central Asia and the Middle East.
This way Afghanistan will be able to collect large fees from trade passing
through the country, including from the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline.

Some of the ongoing national mega projects include the Qosh Tepa Canal project
in the north of the country and the New Kabul City. Other smaller development
projects include the Qatar Township in Kabul, Aino Mena in Kandahar and the
Ghazi Amanullah Khan Town east of Jalalabad. Similar projects are also found
in Herat in the west, Mazar-e-Sharif in the north, Khost in the east, and in
other cities.

There are as much as 5,000 factories in Afghanistan. Most are locally owned,
while others involve foreign investors. They produce construction materials,
furniture, household items, apparel, food, beverages, pharmaceutical products,
etc. The country imports roughly $500 million of textile goods from other
countries. It exported about $168 million worth of cotton in 2022. Afghan
handwoven rugs are one of the most popular products for exportation. Other
products include hand crafted antique replicas as well as leather and furs.
Afghanistan is the third largest exporter of cashmere.

After the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan returned to power, the country
suffered from a major liquidity crisis and lack of banknotes. Because outside
donors have severely cut funding to support Afghanistan's health, education,
and other essential sectors, many Afghans lost their incomes. Under the
assessment system of the World Food Programme (WFP), almost 20 million people
suffered either level-3 “crisis” or level-4 “emergency” levels of food
insecurity. The crisis’ impact on women and girls was especially severe.
Officials under the new Islamic Emirate continue to provide communication
services to areas that lacked them. The government collected 61 billion
afghanis in tariffs in 2022, which increased to 76 billion in 2023. It
continues to attract foreign investors.

## Tourism

Tourism in Afghanistan was at its peak in 1977. Many tourists from around the
world visited Afghanistan, including from as far away as Europe and North
America. All of that ended with the start of the April 1978 Saur Revolution.
However, it is again gradually increasing despite having reputation as one of
the most dangerous countries in the world. Between 4,000 and 20,000 foreign
tourists visit Afghanistan every year. As many as 371,000 Afghans have visited
different parts of the country in 2022. Tourists are advised to avoid areas
where armed criminals may operate.

Ariana, Flydubai and Kam Air all provide flight services between Dubai
International Airport and Kabul International Airport. The city of Kabul has
many guest houses and hotels, which include the Kabul Serena Hotel, the Hotel
Inter-Continental Kabul, the Safi Landmark Hotel, and the Kabul Star Hotel.
Small number of guest houses and hotels are also available in other cities
such Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, Bamyan, Fayezabad, etc. For
those wanting to travel by road, there are bus terminals with mosques, Afghan
style restaurants and small shops in the major cities.

## Energy in Afghanistan

Aerial photography of Kandahar at night in 2011. Its electricity is provided
mainly by two sources, the Kajaki power station in neighboring Helmand
Province and solar farms on the outskirts of the city.

Energy in Afghanistan is provided by hydropower followed by fossil fuel and
solar power. The nation currently generates over 600 megawatts (MW) of
electricity from its several hydroelectric plants as well as using fossil fuel
and solar panels. Over 670 MW more is imported from neighboring Iran,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS)
is the national electricity provider.

Price of electricity is 2.5 afghanis per kw in Kabul Province, 4 afghanis in
Herat Province, and around 6 afghanis in Balkh Province. The government wants
to use the nation's coal reserves to produce extra electricity. The CASA-1000
project will also add 300 MW of electricity to the national grid.

Due to large influx of expats from neighboring Pakistan and Iran, the nation
may require as much as 7,000 MW of electricity in the coming years. The Afghan
National Development Strategy has identified renewable energy alternatives,
such as wind and solar energy, as a high value power source to develop. A
number of major solar and wind farms already exist in the country, with more
under development.
