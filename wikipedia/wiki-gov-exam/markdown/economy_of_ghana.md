The **economy of Ghana** has a diverse and rich resource base, including the
manufacturing and export of digital technology goods, automotive and ship
construction and export, and the export of resources such as hydrocarbons and
industrial minerals. Record high Gold price 2023 earned Ghana 15.6 billion $
of exports.

The Ghanaian domestic economy in 2012 revolved around services, which
accounted for 50% of GDP and employed 28% of the work force. Besides the
industrialization associated with minerals and oil, industrial development in
Ghana remains basic, often associated with plastics (such as chairs, plastic
bags, razors, and pens). 53.6% of Ghana's workforce were employed in
agriculture in 2013.[_outdated statistic_]

Ghana embarked on a currency re-denomination exercise from the Cedi (₵) to the
new currency, Ghana Cedi (GH₵) in July 2007. The transfer rate is 1 Ghana Cedi
for every 10,000 Cedis.

Ghana became the largest gold-producing country in Africa after overtaking
South Africa in 2019. The country is also the second-largest cocoa producer
(after Ivory Coast). Ghana is rich in diamonds,  manganese or manganese ore,
bauxite, and oil. Most of its debt was cancelled in 2005, but government
spending was later allowed to balloon. Coupled with a plunge in oil prices,
this led to an economic crisis that forced the government to negotiate a $920
million extended credit facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
April 2015. Bloomberg rated Ghana currency Cedi as the strongest performing
currency in the World April 2025 against the Dollar reducing its debt burden.

## Taxation

Value-added tax is a consumption tax administered in Ghana. The tax regime
that started in 1998 had a single rate but since September 2007 entered into a
multiple rate regime. In 1998, the rate of tax was 10% and amended in 2000 to
12.5%. The top income tax and corporate tax rates are 25%. Other taxes
included with value-added tax (VAT), are the national health insurance levy,
and a capital gains tax. The overall tax burden was 12.1% of Ghana's total
domestic income in 2013. Ghana's national budget was the equivalent of 39.8%
of GDP in 2013. Ghana is implementing the rent tax in 2021.

## Manufacturing

Ghana's industrial base is relatively advanced. Import-substitution industries
include electronics manufacturing. Rlg Communications is the first indigenous
African company to assemble laptops, desktops, and mobile phones, and is West
Africa's biggest information and communications technology (ICT) and mobile
phone manufacturing company.

Ghana began its automotive industry with the construction of a prototype
robust SUV, named the SMATI Turtle 1, intended for use in the rough African
terrain. It was designed and manufactured by the Artisans of Suame Magazine
Industrial Development Organization. Urban electric cars have been
manufactured in Ghana since 2014.

As of 2012 there were four major companies in the textiles sector: Akosombo
Textiles Limited, Tex Style Ghana Limited, Printex Ghana, and Ghana Textile
Manufacturing Company.

Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and Ghana Oil Company deal with crude oil
and gas exploration, exploitation, and refining.

## Telecommunications

At the end of January 2022, total number of voice subscription in Ghana stood
at 41,380,751.This represents a percentage increase of 1.28% over December
2019 figures of 40,857,007. The total penetration rate stands at 136.79%.

Competition among mobile-phone companies in Ghana is an important part of the
telecommunications industry growth, Current market leader MTN with voice
subscription of 23,150,485 representing 55.95% of the market is followed by
Vodafone with voice subscription of 9,075,795 representing 21.93% market
share, AirtelTigo voice subscription stands at 8,428,322 representing 20.69%,
Glo's current voice subscription stands at 726,149 which represent a market
share of 1.75%.

The mass media of Ghana is among the most liberal in Africa, with Ghana
ranking as the third-freest in Africa and 30th-most free in the world on the
worldwide press freedom index. Chapter 12 of the Constitution of Ghana
guarantees freedom of the Ghanaian press and the independence of the mass
media, and Chapter 2 prohibits censorship. Ghanaian press freedom was restored
in 1992.

Ghana was one of the first countries in Africa to achieve the connection to
the World Wide Web. In 2010, there were 165 licensed internet service
providers in Ghana and they were running 29 of the fiber optic, and authorized
networks VSAT operators were 176, of which 57 functioned, and 99 internet
operators were authorized to the public, and private data and packet-switched
network operators were 25.

## Private banking

The financial services in Ghana have seen a lot of reforms in the past years.
The Banking (Amendment) Act 2007 included the awarding of a general banking
license to qualified banks, which allows only indigenous Ghana offshore banks
to operate in Ghana. Indigenous Ghana private bank Capital Bank was the first
to be awarded the general banking license in Ghana as well as indigenous Ghana
private banks UniBank, National Investment Bank and Prudential Bank Limited.
It has therefore become possible for Ghanaian non-resident individuals or
residents and foreign companies or indigenous Ghana companies to open
indigenous Ghana offshore bank accounts in Ghana. Indigenous Ghana retail and
savings banks include Agricultural Development Bank of Ghana, CAL Bank, GCB
Bank Ltd, Home Finance Company and UT Bank as well as indigenous Ghana savings
and loan institutions ABii National and Savings and Loans Company.

### Stock exchange

The Stock Exchange of Ghana is one of the largest in Africa, with a market
capitalization of GH¢57.2 billion or CN¥180.4 billion in 2012. South Africa's
JSE Limited is the largest.

## Energy

Ghana hydropower and solar energy electricity generation industries, and the
oil and gas industry

As of 2018, Ghana consumed some 10 MMtoe of primary energy, made mostly of
biomass (40%), oil and diesel (40%), followed by hydropower (10%) and natural
gas (10%).

Total energy consumption in Terrawatt-hours (TWh) of Ghana  1980  | 1990  | 2000  | 2010  | 2020  | 2021   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
25  | 29  | 42  | 55  | 112  | 114   
Per capita consumption in Kilowatt-hours (KWh)  
2,135  | 1,900  | 2,117  | 2,142  | 3,484  | 3,483   
  
### Oil & Gas

Ghana discovered significant reserves of oil and natural gas offshore
throughout the 2000s and 2010s. The country officially became an oil & gas
producer in 2010 with the commissioning of the Jubilee field by Tullow Oil and
currently produces from three major offshore hubs: Jubilee, TEN, and OCTP. In
2021, its production stood at some 150,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).
Since production began in 2010 Ghana has rose to be the 34th largest national
producer of oil.

In 2021 Ghana exported more than 71mil barrels of oil. China was the largest
importer of Ghana oil, receiving over 41% of exports with South Africa, the
second largest importer, taking 13.9%.

### Solar energy

Ghana has aggressively begun the construction of solar plants across its sun-
rich land in an aim to become the first country to get 6% of its energy from
solar energy generation. Since construction began in the early 2010s
electricity generation from solar has gone from zero KWh in 2014 to over 60
GWh in 2020, accounting for .46% of Ghana's electricity consumption.

### Wind energy

Wind turbines on a wind farm

Ghana has Class 4–6 wind resources and high-wind locations, such as Nkwanta,
the Accra Plains, and Kwahu and Gambaga mountains. The maximum energy that
could be tapped from Ghana's available wind resource for electricity is
estimated to be about 500–600 GWh/year. To give perspective: in 2011, per the
same Energy Commission, the largest Akosombo hydroelectric dam in Ghana alone
produced 6,495 GWh of electric power and, counting all Ghana's geothermal
energy production in addition, the total energy generated was 11,200 GWh in
that year. These assessments do not take into consideration further limiting
factors such as land-use restrictions, the existing grid (or how far the wind
resource may be from the grid) and accessibility.

### Bio-energy

Hybrid sorghum plantation field

Ghana has put in place mechanisms to attract investments into its biomass and
bio-energy sectors to stimulate rural development, create jobs and save
foreign exchange. Main investments in the bio-energy subsector existed in the
areas of production, are transportation, storage, distribution, sale,
marketing and exportation.

The goal of Ghana regarding bio-energy, as articulated by its energy sector
policy, is to modernize and examine the benefits of bio-energy on a
sustainable basis. Biomass is Ghana's dominant energy resource in terms of
endowment and consumption, with the two primary bio-fuels consumed being
ethanol and biodiesel. To that effect, the Ghana ministry of Energy in 2010
developed its energy sector strategy and development plan. Highlights of the
strategy include sustaining the supply and efficient use of wood fuels while
ensuring that their utilization does not lead to deforestation.

The plan would support private sector investments in the cultivation of bio-
fuel feedstock, the extraction of bio-oil, and refining it into secondary
products, thereby creating financial and tax incentives. The Ghana Renewal
Energy Act provides the necessary fiscal incentives for renewable energy
development by the private sector, and also details the control and management
of bio-fuel and wood fuel projects in Ghana. The Ghana National Petroleum
Authority (NPA) was tasked by the Renewable Energy Act 2011 to price Ghana's
bio-fuel blend in accordance with the prescribed petroleum pricing formula.

The combined effects of climate change and global economic turbulence had
triggered a sense of urgency among Ghanaian policymakers, industry and
development practitioners to find sustainable and viable solutions in the area
of bio-fuels.

Brazil, which makes ethanol from maize and sugarcane, is currently the world's
largest bio-fuel market.

### Energy consumption

Electricity generation is one of the key factors in achieving the development
of the Ghanaian national economy, with aggressive and rapid industrialization;
Ghana's national electric energy consumption was 265 kilowatts per capita in
2009. Shortages of electricity have led to dumsor (blackouts), increasing the
interest in renewables.

## Hydrocarbon and mining

Ghanaian mineral resources: bauxite, diamond, timber and manganese

Ghana's increasing oil exports as a percentage of all exports

Ghana has 5 billion barrels (790×10~~^~~ 6 m3) to 7 billion barrels
(1.1×10~~^~~ 9 m3) of petroleum in reserves. A large oilfield which contains
up to 3 billion barrels (480×10~~^~~ 6 m3) of sweet crude oil was discovered
in 2007. Since these discoveries Ghana increased production steadily, the
nations current peak is 200,000 barrels per day in 2019. Current production in
2021 stands at 179,900 barrels per day.

Ghana has vast natural gas reserves, which is used by many foreign
multinational companies operating in Ghana. The hydrocarbon industry has had
major implications for regional and urban development in Ghana and these are
likely to substantially increase in the years to come

Mining has gained importance in the Ghanaian economy since the turn of the
21st century, with a growth of around 30% in 2007. The main mining extractions
are bauxite, gold (Ghana is one of the largest gold producers in the world),
and the phosphates.

## Tourism

Tourism destinations in Ghana

The Ministry of Tourism has placed great emphasis upon further tourism support
and development. Tourism contributed to 4.9% of GDP in 2009, attracting around
500,000 visitors. Tourist destinations include Ghana's many castles and forts,
national parks, beaches, nature reserves, landscapes and World Heritage
buildings and sites.

In 2011, _Forbes_ magazine ranked Ghana eleventh-friendliest country in the
world. The assertion was based on a survey of a cross-section of travelers in
2010. Of all the countries on the African continent that were included in the
survey, Ghana ranked highest.

To enter Ghana, it is necessary to have a visa authorized by the Government of
Ghana, except for certain entrepreneurs on business trips.

## Agriculture

In 2013 agriculture employed 53.6% of Ghana's total labor force. Agribusiness
accounts for a small fraction of the gross domestic product. The main
harvested crops are corn, plantain, rice, millet, sorghum, cassava and yam.
Unlike the agricultural livestock, forestry and fishing sectors, the crop
sector is key to the Ghanaian agricultural industry.

Ghana produced in 2018:

  * 20.8 million tons of cassava (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria, Thailand and Congo)
  * 7.8 million tonnes of yam (2nd largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria)
  * 4.1 million tons of plantain (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind Congo)
  * 2.6 million tons of palm oil (8th largest producer in the world)
  * 2.3 million tons of maize
  * 1.4 million tons of taro (4th largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria, China and Cameroon)
  * 947 thousand tons of cocoa (2nd largest producer in the world, second only to Ivory Coast)
  * 769 thousand tons of rice
  * 753 thousand tons of orange (19th largest producer in the world)
  * 713 thousand tons of pineapple (11th largest producer in the world)
  * 521 thousand tons of peanut

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like sweet
potato (151 thousand tons), natural rubber (23 thousand tons) and tobacco (2.3
thousand tons).

## Ghana: Vision 2020 and industrialization

With the economic program "Ghana: Vision 2020", Ghana intends to achieve its
goals of accelerated economic growth and improved quality of life for all its
citizens, by reducing poverty through private investment, rapid and aggressive
industrialization, and direct and aggressive poverty-alleviation efforts.
These plans were released in the 1995 government report, Ghana: Vision 2020.
Nationalization of state-owned enterprises continues, with about two thirds of
300 parastatal enterprises owned by the government of Ghana. Other reforms
adopted under the government's structural adjustment program include
increasing exchange rate controls and increasing autarky and increasing
restrictions on imports.

The Ghana: Vision 2020 forecast assumes political stability; successful
economic stabilization; the implementation of Ghana: Vision 2020 policy agenda
on private sector growth; and aggressive public spending on social services,
infrastructure and industrialization. It projection states that Ghana's goals
of reaching high-income economy status and newly industrialized country status
will be easily realized between 2020 and 2039.

## Economic transparency

The distribution of wealth ownership in Ghanaian society in 2013. A majority
of wealth is held by 20% of the population.

The judicial system of Ghana deals with corruption, economic malpractice and
lack of economic transparency. Despite significant economic progress,
obstacles do remain. Particular institutions need reform, and property rights
need improvement. The overall investment regime lacks market transparency.
Tackling these issues will be necessary if Ghana's rapid economic growth is to
be maintained.

According to Transparency International's 2022 Corruption Perception Index,
Ghana was ranked 72nd out of 180 countries, with a score of 43 on a scale
where a 0–9 score means highly corrupt, and a 90–100 score means very clean.
This was based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. John Addo
Kufuor, son of former President John Agyekum Kufuor and Kojo Annan, son of
former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, have been named in
association with the Panama Papers.

### Health and biotechnology

The Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine is an agency of the
Ministry of Health that was set up in the 1970s for research and development
and as a practical resource (product production & distribution/provision)
primarily in areas of biotechnology related to medicinal plants. This includes
both herbal medicine and work on more advanced applications. It also has a
secondary role as an educational resource for foreign students in health,
biotechnology and related fields.

### Cybernetics and cyberwarfare

The use of computer technology for teaching and learning began to receive
government of Ghana's attention from the late 1990s. The information and
communications technology in education policy of Ghana requires the use of
information and communications technology for teaching and learning at all
levels of education. The Ministry of Education supports institutions in
teaching of information and communications technology literacy. The majority
of secondary, and some basic schools of Ghana have computer laboratories.

Ghana's intention to become the information technology hub of West Africa has
led the government of Ghana to enact cyber crime legislation and enhance cyber
security practices. Acting on that goal, in 2008 Ghana passed the _Electronic
Communications Act_ and the _Electronic Transactions Act_ , which established
the legal framework for governing information technology. In November 2011,
the Deputy Minister for Communications and Technology announced the
development of a national cyber security strategy, aimed at combating cyber
crime and securing critical infrastructure.

In June 2012, the National Information Technology Agency announced a national
computer emergency response team "strategy" designed to co-ordinate government
response to cyber-attacks, both internal and external. The agency also
established computer emergency response teams for each municipal,
metropolitan, and district assembly to improve co-ordination and information-
sharing on cyberspace threats. Ghana is ranked 2nd in Africa and 7th globally
in cyber warfare, cyber-terrorism, cyber crime, and internet crime. In 2018,
the National Cyber Security Centre was founded. It is the national agency
responsible for cybersecurity. In November 2020, Parliament passed the
Cybersecurity Act 2020. The Minister for Communications, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful,
indicated that, "a successful economy is hinged on a secured, safe and

### Real estate

The real estate and housing market has become an important and strategic
economic sector, particularly in the urban centres of south Ghana such as
Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi and Tema. However, many of its citizens
particularly those in Accra cannot afford the housing prices which is a trait
of most major cities globally particularly in the West. Kumasi is growing at a
faster rate than Accra, and there is less competition in its real estate
market. The gross rental income tax of Ghana is withheld at 10%, capital gains
are taxed at 15% with a 5% gift tax imposed on the transfer of properties and
Ghana's real estate market is divided into 3 areas: public sector real estate
development, emerging private sector real estate development, and private
individuals. The activities of these 3 groups are facilitated by the Ghanaian
banks and the primary mortgage market which has demonstrated enormous growth
potential. Recent developments have given birth to a boom in the construction
sector, including the housing and public housing sector generating and
injecting billions of dollars annually into the Ghanaian economy. The real
estate market investment perspective and attraction comes from Ghana's
tropical location and robust political stability. An increasing number of the
Ghanaian populace are investing in properties, and the Ghana government is
empowering the private sector in the real estate direction.

### Trade and exports

In July 2013, International Enterprise Singapore a global office in Accra to
develop trade and investment on logistics, oil and gas, aviation,
transportation and consumer sectors. Singapore and Ghana also signed four
bilateral agreements to promote public sector and private sector
collaboration, as Ghana aims to predominantly shift its economic trade
partnership to East Asia and Southeast Asia. The economic centre is IE
Singapore's second office in Africa. Ghana's labour force in 2008 totalled
11.5 million Ghanaian citizens. Tema Harbour is Africa's largest manmade
harbour, and Takoradi Harbour along with Tema harbour handle goods and
exports. They are also traffic junctions where goods are transhipped; the Tema
harbour handles the majority of the nation's export cargo and most of the
country's chief exports is shipped from Takoradi harbour. The Takoradi harbour
and Tema harbour are operated by the state-owned Ghana Ports and Harbours
Authority.

## Challenges

Bank of Ghana

Over the years, the country has encountered various economic challenges
especially in its bid to become financially sustainable. One of the most
prominent has been high public debt. In January 2023, the Bank of Ghana
reported that the country's level of debt was up to the tune of GH¢575.7
billion at the end of November 2022.

## Child labor

The 2010 United States Department of Labor estimated over 2.7 million child
laborers in Ghana, or about 43% of all children aged 5–14. 78.7% of these
children work in agriculture, 17.6% in fishing and transportation services,
and 3.7% in industry, which includes manufacturing work and mining. In Ghana
64% of children seek work for financial reasons, making it the leading driver
for child labor in the region. Most children working in rural areas are
working on family farms and often combine schooling with their work. In Urban
areas, such as Accra and Ashanti children are often not enrolled in school and
are often engaged in artisanal fishing and domestic services. Child porters,
locally called _kayaye_ , work in urban areas and some of them are as young as
6 years.

Agriculture, fishing and artisan mining were the largest employers.

In southern Volta region, children work in religious servitude for a period
ranging between few months to three years. They are known as _trokosi_
(literally: wife of a god), _fiashidi_ , or _vudusi_. This practice requires
young girls to work and serve the religious order, in order to atone for
family members’ alleged sins or as an offering for the family's good fortune.
This practice is claimed to be also present in neighboring countries, even
though it has been outlawed and carries a prison term under the laws of Ghana
and neighboring countries.

In 2013, statistics on children's work have not changed much and according to
the DOL's _Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor_ in Ghana, the majority
of working children engage in hazardous activities like pesticide spraying in
the production of cocoa, fishing and gold mining. The Department's 2014 _List
of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor_ includes fish and tilapia in
particular, cocoa and gold as goods produced in such working conditions in
Ghana.
