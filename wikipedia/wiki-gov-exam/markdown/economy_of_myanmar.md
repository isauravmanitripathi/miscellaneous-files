The **economy ofMyanmar** is the seventh largest in Southeast Asia. After the
return of civilian rule in 2011, the new government launched large-scale
reforms, focused initially on the political system to restore peace and
achieve national unity and moving quickly to an economic and social reform
program. Current economic statistics were a huge decline from the economic
statistics of Myanmar in the fiscal year of 2020, in which Myanmar’s nominal
GDP was $81.26 billion and its purchasing power adjusted GDP was $279.14
billion. Myanmar has faced an economic crisis since the 2021 coup d'état.
According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) Myanmar GDP per capita in 2024
is estimated to reach $1.179

## History

### Classical era

Burma has been the main trade route between China and India since 100 BC. The
Mon Kingdom of lower Burma served as important trading centre in the Bay of
Bengal. The majority of the population was involved in rice production and
other forms of agriculture. Burma used silver as a medium of exchange. All
land was technically owned by the Burmese monarch. Exports, along with oil
wells, gem mining and teak production were controlled by the monarch. Burma
was vitally involved in the Indian Ocean trade. Logged teak was a prized
export that was used in European shipbuilding because of its durability, and
became the focal point of Burmese exports from the 1700s to the 1800s.

Under the monarchy, the economy of Myanmar had been one of redistribution, a
concept embedded in local society, religion, and politics (Dāna). The state
set the prices of the most important commodities. Agrarian self-sufficiency
was vital, while trade was only of secondary importance.

### British Burma (1885–1948)

Under the British administration, the people of Burma were at the bottom of
social hierarchy, with Europeans at the top, Indians, Chinese, and
Christianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist Burmese at the bottom.
Integrated into the world economy by force, economic growth in Burma was
driven by the extractive industries and cash crop agriculture, and the country
had the second-highest GDP per capita in Southeast Asia. However, much of the
wealth was concentrated in the hands of Europeans. The country became the
world's largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other
colonies like India suffered mass starvation. The British followed the
ideologies of Social Darwinism and the free market, and opened up the country
to a large-scale immigration with Rangoon exceeding New York City as the
greatest immigration port in the world in the 1920s. Historian Thant Myint-U
states, "This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was
equivalent to the United Kingdom today taking 2 million people a year." By
then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Rangoon, Akyab, Bassein and
Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The
Burmese under British rule felt helpless, and reacted with a "racism that
combined feelings of superiority and fear".

Crude oil production, an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung, was taken over by
the British and put under Burmah Oil monopoly. British Burma began exporting
crude oil in 1853. It produced 75% of the world's teak. The wealth was
however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In the 1930s,
agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices
declined and did not recover for several decades.

During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, the British followed a
scorched earth policy. They destroyed the major government buildings, oil
wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the
Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies. After independence,
the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed.
With the loss of India, Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from
the British. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime
Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was
declared the owner of all land. The government tried to implement an eight-
year plan partly financed by injecting money into the economy which caused
some inflation.

### Post-independence and under U Nu and Ne Win (1948–1988)

After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu
embarked upon a policy of nationalisation. He attempted to make Burma a
welfare state by adopting central planning measures. By the 1950s, rice
exports had decreased by two-thirds and mineral exports by over 96%. Plans
were implemented in setting up light consumer industries by private sector.
The 1962 Burmese coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the
Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalise all industries, with the
exception of agriculture. The catastrophic program turned Burma into one of
the world's most impoverished countries. Burma was classified as a least
developed country by the United Nations in 1987.

### Rule of the generals (1988–2011)

After 1988, the regime retreated from a command economy. It permitted modest
expansion of the private sector, allowed some foreign investment, and received
much needed foreign exchange. Than Shwe advocated for some deregulation
economic policies, despite his relaxation of some restrictions on Burma's
economy, his economic policies have been often criticized as ill-planned. Shwe
relaxed some state control over the economy, and was a supporter of Burma's
participation in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). He also
oversaw a large crackdown on corruption, which saw the sackings of a number of
cabinet ministers and regional commanders in 1997. Shwe advocated for Crony
capitalism. The economy was rated in 2009 as the least free in Asia (tied with
North Korea). All basic market institutions are suppressed. Private
enterprises were often co-owned or indirectly owned by state. The corruption
watchdog organisation Transparency International in its 2007 Corruption
Perceptions Index released on 26 September 2007 ranked Burma the most corrupt
country in the world, tied with Somalia.

The national currency is the kyat. Burma currently has a dual exchange rate
system similar to Cuba. The market rate was around two hundred times below the
government-set rate in 2006. In 2011, the Burmese government enlisted the aid
of the International Monetary Fund to evaluate options to reform the current
exchange rate system, to stabilise the domestic foreign exchange trading
market and reduce economic distortions. The dual exchange rate system allows
for the government and state-owned enterprises to divert funds and revenues,
while also giving the government more control over the local economy and
making it possible to temporarily subdue inflation.

Inflation averaged 30.1% between 2005 and 2007. In April 2007, the National
League for Democracy organised a two-day workshop on the economy. The workshop
concluded that skyrocketing inflation was impeding economic growth. "Basic
commodity prices have increased from 30% to 60% since the military regime
promoted a pay rise for government workers in April 2006," said Soe Win, the
moderator of the workshop. "Inflation is also correlated with corruption."
Myint Thein, an NLD spokesperson, added: "Inflation is the critical source of
the current economic crisis."

In recent years, China and India attempted to strengthen ties with Myanmar for
mutual benefit. The European Union and some nations including the United
States and Canada imposed investment and trade sanctions on Burma. The United
States banned all imports from Burma, though this restriction was since
lifted. Foreign investment comes primarily from China, Singapore, South Korea,
India, and Thailand.

### Economic liberalisation (2011–2019)

In 2011, when new President Thein Sein's government came to power, Burma
embarked on a major policy of reforms including anti-corruption, currency
exchange rate regulation, foreign investment laws and taxation. Foreign
investments increased from US$300 million in 2009–10 to a US$20 billion in
2010–11 by about 6567%. Large inflow of capital results in stronger Burmese
currency, kyat by about 25%. In response, the government relaxed import
restrictions and abolished export taxes. Despite current currency problems,
Burmese economy is expected to grow by about 8.8% in 2011. After the
completion of 58-billion dollar Dawei deep seaport, Burma is expected be at
the hub of trade connecting Southeast Asia and the South China Sea, via the
Andaman Sea, to the Indian Ocean receiving goods from countries in the Middle
East, Europe and Africa, and spurring growth in the ASEAN region.

In 2012, the Asian Development Bank formally began re-engaging with the
country, to finance infrastructure and development projects in the country.
The $512 million loan is the first issued by the ADB to Myanmar in 30 years
and will target banking services, ultimately leading to other major
investments in road, energy, irrigation and education projects.

In March 2012, a draft foreign investment law emerged, the first in more than
2 decades. This law oversees the unprecedented liberalisation of the economy.
It for example stipulates that foreigners no longer require a local partner to
start a business in the country and can legally lease land. The draft law also
stipulates that Burmese citizens must constitute at least 25% of the firm's
skilled workforce, and with subsequent training, up to 50–75%.

On 28 January 2013, the government of Myanmar announced deals with
international lenders to cancel or refinance nearly $6 billion of its debt,
almost 60 per cent of what it owes to foreign lenders. Japan wrote off US$3
Billion, nations in the group of Paris Club wrote off US$2.2 Billion and
Norway wrote off US$534 Million.

Myanmar's inward foreign direct investment has steadily increased since its
reform. The country approved US$4.4 billion worth of investment projects
between January and November 2014.

According to one report released on 30 May 2013, by the McKinsey Global
Institute, Burma's future looks bright, with its economy expected to quadruple
by 2030 if it invests in more high-tech industries. This however does assume
that other factors (such as drug trade, the continuing war of the government
with specific ethnic groups, etc.) do not interfere.

As of October 2017, less than 10% of Myanmar's population has a bank account.
As of 2016–17 approximately 98 percent of the population has smartphones and
mobile money schemes are being implemented without the use of banks similar to
African countries.

### Economic crisis (2020–present)

Myanmar's economy has been in economic crisis since the coup d’état in
February 2021. On April 30, 2021, the United Nations Development Programme
noted that the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état could
reverse economic gains made over the last sixteen years. Overall, Myanmar’s
economy under SAC rule is defined by stagnation, inflation, capital flight,
and fractured governance. With no political resolution in sight, prospects for
recovery and inclusive growth remain bleak. The SAC’s economic strategy
prioritizes regime survival through resource extraction and coercive controls,
such as forced currency conversions and price fixing. This erratic and
reactionary governance has undermined investor confidence and distorted
markets.

Under the military-led State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar’s economy
has sharply declined, becoming the weakest in Southeast Asia. In fiscal year
2024-25, real GDP is projected to contract by 1%, continuing a prolonged
downturn following an 18% collapse post-coup. Agriculture shrank by 4%, while
industry and services showed no growth. As the formal economy contracts,
informal and illicit sectors have expanded. Myanmar is now the world’s largest
opium producer and a major hub for synthetic drugs and online scam centers.
Foreign investment has plummeted, with FDI approvals dropping from over $5
billion in fiscal year 2019-20 to $662 million in fiscal year 2023-24.
International sanctions, financial blacklisting, and growing regulatory
opacity have further discouraged engagement.

Poverty has surged nationwide, with 77% of households now poor or near-poor,
up from 58% in 2017. High inflation—driven by extensive money printing—peaked
at 35% in 2022 and remains elevated, particularly for food and transport. Real
wages have fallen across sectors, deepening household vulnerability. Labour
shortages have worsened due to mass outmigration, particularly after the 2024
conscription law. An estimated one-fifth of the population has left their
communities due to conflict or hardship, draining the workforce and reducing
productivity. Trade declined in 2023 after a brief rebound, with exports down
$4 billion and land border trade sharply reduced in 2024. The financial sector
remains weak, with liquidity shortages, low public trust, and a shrinking
microfinance industry.

When the kyat fell by a third of its pre-coup value, the central bank then
sold $600 million worth of foreign reserves (10% of the entire country's
total) to prop up the kyat. By April 2022, reserves dwindled, foreign
investment fell and remittances plummeted. This led the junta to impose
capital controls and import restrictions which led to shortages of diabetes
and cancer medicines.

The overall loss of skilled workers has contributed to a 9–11% GDP contraction
since 2020. With the SAC prioritizing military aims over economic and human
development, Myanmar faces a prolonged human resource crisis that could impact
its economic recovery for decades.

## Still unresolved internal problems

In a first ever countrywide study in 2013, the Myanmar government found that
37 per cent of the population were unemployed and 26 per cent lived in
poverty.

The current state of the Burmese economy has also had a significant impact on
the people of Burma, as economic hardship results in extreme delays of
marriage and family building. The average age of marriage in Burma is 27.5 for
men, 26.4 for women, almost unparalleled in the region, with the exception of
developed countries like Singapore.

Burma also has a low fertility rate of 2.07 children per woman (2010),
especially as compared to other Southeast Asian countries of similar economic
standing, like Cambodia (3.18) and Laos (4.41), representing a significant
decline from 4.7 in 1983, despite the absence of a national population policy.
This is at least partly attributed to the economic strain that additional
children place on family income, and has resulted in the prevalence of illegal
abortions in the country, as well as use of other forms of birth control.

The 2012 foreign investment law draft, included a proposal to transform the
Myanmar Investment Commission from a government-appointed body into an
independent board. This could bring greater transparency to the process of
issuing investment licenses, according to the proposed reforms drafted by
experts and senior officials. However, even with this draft, it will still
remain a question on whether corruption in the government can be addressed
(links have been shown between certain key individuals inside the government
and the drug trade, as well as many industries that use forced labour -for
example the mining industry-).

Many regions (such as the Golden Triangle) remain off-limits for foreigners,
and in some of these regions, the government is at war with the country's
ethnic minorities and the opposition.

## Industries

The major agricultural product is rice which covers about 60% of the country's
total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain
production by weight. Through collaboration with the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI), 52 modern rice varieties were released in the
country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14
million tons in 1987 and to 19 million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties
were planted on half of the country's rice fields, including 98% of the
irrigated areas. In 2011, Myanmar's total milled rice production accounted for
10.60 million tons, an increase from the 1.8 per cent back in 2010.

In northern Burma, opium bans have ended a century old tradition of growing
poppy. Between 20,000 and 30,000 ex-poppy farmers left the Kokang region as a
result of the ban in 2002.

Rubber plantations are being promoted in areas of high elevation like Mong
Mao. Sugar is grown in the lowlands such as Mong Pawk District.

The lack of an educated workforce skilled in modern technology contributes to
the country's economic problems.

Lately, the Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure. Goods travel primarily
across Thai and China borders and through the main port in Yangon.

Railroads are old and dilapidated, with few repairs since their construction
under British rule in the late nineteenth century. Presently China and Japan
are providing aid to upgrade rail transport. Highways are normally paved,
except in remote border regions. Energy shortages are common throughout the
country including in Yangon. About 30 percent of the country's population does
not have access to electricity, with 70 per cent of people living in rural
areas. The civilian government has indicated that electricity will be imported
from Laos to fulfil demand.

Other industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products,
construction materials, gems, metals, oil and natural gas.

The private sector dominates agriculture, light industry, and transport
activities, while the government controls energy, heavy industry, and military
industries.

### Garment production

The garment industry is a major job creator in the Yangon area, with around
200,000 workers employed in total in mid-2015. The Myanmar Government has
introduced minimum wage of MMK 4,800 (US$3.18) per day for the garment workers
from March 2018.

The Myanmar garments sector has seen significant influx of foreign direct
investment, if measured by the number of entries rather than their value. In
March 2012, six of Thailand's largest garment manufacturers announced that
they would move production to Myanmar, principally to the Yangon area, citing
lower labour costs. In mid-2015, about 55% of officially registered garment
firms in Myanmar were known to be fully or partly foreign-owned, with about
25% of the foreign firms from China and 17% from Hong Kong. Foreign-linked
firms supply almost all garment exports, and these have risen rapidly in
recent years, especially since EU sanctions were lifted in 2012. Myanmar
exported $1.6 billion worth of garments and textiles in 2016.

### Illegal drug trade

A world map of the world's primary opium or heroin producers. The Golden
Triangle region, which Burma is part of, is pinpointed in this map.

Burma (Myanmar) is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with
the majority of _ya ba_ found in Thailand produced in Burma, particularly in
the Golden Triangle and Northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos
and China. Burmese-produced _ya ba_ is typically trafficked to Thailand via
Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of Isan.

In 2010, Burma trafficked 1 billion tablets to neighbouring Thailand. In 2009,
the Chinese authorities seized over 40 million tablets that had been illegally
trafficked from Burma. Ethnic militias and rebel groups (in particular the
United Wa State Army) are responsible for much of this production; however,
the Burmese military units are believed to be heavily involved in the
trafficking of the drugs.

Burma is also the second largest supplier of opium (following Afghanistan) in
the world, with 95% of opium grown in Shan State. Illegal narcotics have
generated $1 to US$2 billion in exports annually, with estimates of 40% of the
country's foreign exchange coming from drugs. Efforts to eradicate opium
cultivation have pushed many ethnic rebel groups, including the United Wa
State Army and the Kokang to diversify into methamphetamine production.

Prior to the 1980s, heroin was typically transported from Burma to Thailand,
before being trafficked by sea to Hong Kong, which was and still remains the
major transit point at which heroin enters the international market. Now, drug
trafficking has shifted to southern China (from Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi,
Guangdong) because of a growing market for drugs in China, before reaching
Hong Kong.

The prominence of major drug traffickers have allowed them to penetrate other
sectors of the Burmese economy, including the banking, airline, hotel and
infrastructure industries. Their investment in infrastructure have allowed
them to make more profits, facilitate drug trafficking and money laundering.
The share of informal economy in Myanmar is one of the largest in the world
that feeds into trade in illegal drugs.

### Oil and gas

  * The Yadana Project is a project to exploit the Yadana gas field in the Andaman Sea and to carry natural gas to Thailand through Myanmar.
  * Sino-Burma pipelines refers to planned oil and natural gas pipelines linking Burma's deep-water port of Kyaukphyu (Sittwe) in the Bay of Bengal with Kunming in Yunnan province, China.
  * The Norwegian company Seadrill owned by John Fredriksen is involved in offshore oildrilling, expected to give the Burmese government oil and oil export revenues.
  * Myanmar exported $3.5 billion worth of gas, mostly to Thailand in the fiscal year up to March 2012.
  * Initiation to bid on oil exploration licenses for 18 of Myanmar's onshore oil blocks has been released on 18 January 2013.

### Renewable energy

Myanmar has rich solar power and hydropower potential. The country's technical
solar power potential is the greatest among the countries of the Greater
Mekong Subregion. Wind energy, biogas and biomass have limited potential and
are weakly developed.

Financing geothermal projects in Myanmar use an estimated break even power
cost of 5.3–8.6 U.S cents/kWh or in Myanmar Kyat 53–86K per kWh. This pegs a
non-fluctuating $1=1000K, which is a main concern for power project funding.
The main drawback with depreciation pressures, in the current FX market.
Between June 2012 and October 2015, the Myanmar Kyat depreciated by
approximately 35%, from 850 down to 1300 against the US Dollar. Local
businesses with foreign denominated loans from abroad suddenly found
themselves rushing for a strategy to mitigate currency risks. Myanmar's
current lack of available currency hedging solutions presents a real challenge
for geothermal project financing.

### Gemstones

Myanmar's economy depends heavily on sales of precious stones such as
sapphires, pearls and jade. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's
rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and
hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Burma's "_Valley of
Rubies_ ", the mountainous Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay, is
noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires. Burma's gemstone
industry is a cornerstone of the Burmese economy with exports topping $1
billion.

In 2007, following the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Myanmar, human
rights organisations, gem dealers, and US First Lady Laura Bush called for a
boycott of a Myanmar gem auction held twice yearly, arguing that the sale of
the stones profited the dictatorial regime in that country. Debbie Stothard of
the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma stated that mining operators used drugs
on employees to improve productivity, with needles shared, raising the risk of
HIV infection. Richard W. Hughes, a Bangkok-based gemologist makes the point
that for every ruby sold through the junta, another gem that supports
subsistence mining is smuggled over the Thai border.

The Chinese have also been the chief driving force behind Burma's gem mining
industry and jade exports. The industry is completely under Chinese hands at
every level, from the financiers, concession operators, all the way to the
retail merchants that own scores of newly opened gem markets. One Chinese-
owned jeweller reportedly controls 100 gem mines and produces over 2,000
kilograms of raw rubies annually. Since the privatization of the gem industry
during the 1990s, Burmese jewelers and entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have
transformed Burma's gem industry into new retail jewelry shops, selling
coveted pieces of expensive jewelry to customers mainly hailing from Hong Kong
and Taiwan.

The permits for new gem mines in Mogoke, Mineshu and Nanyar state will be
issued by the ministry according to a statement issued by the ministry on 11
February. While many sanctions placed on the former regime were eased or
lifted in 2012, the US has left restrictions on importing rubies and jade from
Myanmar intact. According to recent amendments to the new Myanmar foreign
investment law, there is no longer a minimum capital requirement for
investments, except in mining ventures, which require substantial proof of
capital and must be documented through a domestic bank. Another important
clarification in the investment law is the dropping of foreign ownership
restrictions in joint ventures, except in restricted sectors, such as mining,
where FDI will be capped at 80 per cent.

Myanmar is famed for its production of Golden South Sea Pearls. In recent
years, the countries has auctioned its production in Hong Kong, first
organized by Belpearl company in 2013 to critical acclaim and premium prices
due to strong Chinese demand. Notable pearls include the New Dawn of Myanmar,
a 19mm round golden pearl which sold to an anonymous buyer for undisclosed
price.

### Tourism

Since 1992, the government has encouraged tourism. Until 2008, fewer than
750,000 tourists entered the country annually, but there has been substantial
growth over the past years. In 2012, 1.06 million tourists visited the
country, and 1.8 million are expected to visit by the end of 2013.

Tourism is a growing sector of the economy of Burma. Burma has diverse and
varied tourist attractions and is served internationally by numerous airlines
via direct flights. Domestic and foreign airlines also operate flights within
the country. Cruise ships also dock at Yangon. Overland entry with a border
pass is permitted at several border checkpoints. The government requires a
valid passport with an entry visa for all tourists and business people. As of
May 2010, foreign business visitors from any country can apply for a visa on
arrival when passing through Yangon and Mandalay international airports
without having to make any prior arrangements with travel agencies. Both the
tourist visa and business visa are valid for 28 days, renewable for an
additional 14 days for tourism and three months for business. Seeing Burma
through a personal tour guide is popular. Travellers can hire guides through
travel agencies.

Aung San Suu Kyi has requested that international tourists not visit Burma.
Moreoever, the junta's forced labour programmes were focused on tourist
destinations; these designations have been heavily criticised for their human
rights records. Even disregarding the obviously governmental fees, Burma's
Minister of Hotels and Tourism Major-General Saw Lwin admitted that the
government receives a significant percentage of the income of private sector
tourism services. In addition, only a very small minority of impoverished
people in Burma receive any money with any relation to tourism.

Before 2012, much of the country was completely off-limits to tourists, and
the military tightly controlled interactions between foreigners and the people
of Burma. Locals were not allowed to discuss politics with foreigners, under
penalty of imprisonment, and in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion Board
issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit "unnecessary
contact" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese people. Since 2012, Burma has
opened up to more tourism and foreign capital, synonymous with the country's
transition to democracy.

### Infrastructure

The Myanmar Infrastructure Summit 2018 noted that Myanmar has an urgent need
to "close its infrastructure gap", with an anticipated expenditure of US$120
billion funding its infrastructural projects between now and 2030. More
specifically, infrastructural development in Myanmar should address three
major challenges over the upcoming years: 1) Road modernization and
integration with neighboring roads and transportation networks; 2) Development
of regional airports and expansion of existing airport capacity, and 3)
Maintenance and consolidation of urban transport infrastructure, through
instalments of innovative transportation tools including but not limited to
water-taxis and air-conditioned buses. Myanmar needs to scale up its enabling
infrastructure like transport, power supply and public utilities.

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure projects may affect 24
million people in Myanmar living in the BRI corridors, thus transforming the
allocation of economic benefits and losses among economic actors in the
country.

According to the CIA World Factbook,

> Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive government controls,
> inefficient economic policies, and rural poverty. The junta took steps in
> the early 1990s to liberalize the economy after decades of failure under the

The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% from 2009 onwards.

## Foreign investment

Though foreign investment has been encouraged, it has so far met with only
moderate success. The United States has placed trade sanctions on Burma. The
European Union has placed embargoes on arms, non-humanitarian aid, visa bans
on military regime leaders, and limited investment bans. Both the European
Union and the US have placed sanctions on grounds of human rights violations
in the country. Many nations in Asia, particularly India, Thailand and China
have actively traded with Burma. However, on April 22, 2013, the EU suspended
economic and political sanctions against Burma.

The public sector enterprises remain highly inefficient and also privatisation
efforts have stalled.[_citation needed_] The estimates of Burmese foreign
trade are highly ambiguous because of the great volume of black market
trading. A major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal
stability. One government initiative was to utilise Burma's large natural gas
deposits. Currently, Burma has attracted investment from Thai, Malaysian,
Filipino, Russian, Australian, Indian, and Singaporean companies. Trade with
the US amounted to $243.56 million as of February 2013, accounting for 15
projects and just 0.58 per cent of the total, according to government
statistics.

### Asian investment

_The Economist_ 's special report on Burma points to increased economic
activity resulting from Burma's political transformation and influx of foreign
direct investment from Asian neighbours. Near the Mingaladon Industrial Park,
for example, Japanese-owned factories have risen from the "debris" caused by
"decades of sanctions and economic mismanagement." Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzō Abe has identified Burma as an economically attractive market that will
help stimulate the Japanese economy. Among its various enterprises, Japan is
helping build the Thilawa Port, which is part of the Thilawa Special Economic
Zone, and helping fix the electricity supply in Yangon.

Japan is not the largest investor in Myanmar. "Thailand, for instance, the
second biggest investor in Myanmar after China, is forging ahead with a bigger
version of Thilawa at Dawei, on Myanmar's Tenasserim Coast ... Thai rulers
have for centuries been toying with the idea of building a canal across the
Kra Isthmus, linking the Gulf of Thailand directly to the Andaman Sea and the
Indian Ocean to avoid the journey round peninsular Malaysia through the Strait
of Malacca." Dawei would give Thailand that connection.

### Chinese investment

China, by far the biggest investor in Burma, has focused on constructing oil
and gas pipelines that "crisscross the country, starting from a new terminus
at Kyaukphyu, just below Sittwe, up to Mandalay and on to the Chinese border
town of Ruili and then Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province". This would
prevent China from "having to funnel oil from Africa and the Middle East
through the bottleneck around Singapore".

Since the Myanmar's military junta took power as the State Peace and
Development Council junta in 1988, the ties between China's People's
Liberation Army and Myanmar's military forces developed and formalised key
ties between the two states. China became Myanmar's key source of aid, loans
and other financial assistance. China remained Myanmar's biggest foreign
investor in 2013 even after the economy opened up to other providers like
Japan and India. Chinese monetary assistance allowed China to gain structural
power of Myanmar and a dominant position within the natural resource sector.
During this period, an underdeveloped Burmese industrial sector was driven in
part by Chinese investment and consumption of a few key extractive sectors
such as mining, driving domestic production away from consumer goods sectors
like textiles and electronics.

Zone in 2019.

Legal two-way trade between Burma and mainland China reached US$1.5 billion
annually by 1988 and additional Chinese trade, investment, economic, and
military aid was sought to invigorate and jumpstart the re-emerging Burmese
economy.[_citation needed_] An influx of foreign capital investment from
mainland China, Germany, and France has led to the development of new
potential construction projects across Burma. Many of these infrastructure
projects are in the hands of Chinese construction contractors and civil
engineers with various projects such as irrigation dams, highways, bridges,
ground satellite stations, and an international airport for Mandalay. Burmese
entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have also established numerous joint
ventures and corporate partnerships with mainland Chinese State-owned
enterprises to facilitate the construction of oil pipelines that potentially
could create thousands of jobs throughout the country.[_citation needed_]
Private Chinese companies rely on the established overseas Chinese bamboo
network as a conduit between mainland China and Burmese Chinese businesses to
navigate the local economic landscape and facilitate trade between the two
countries. Mainland China is now Burma's most important source of foreign
goods and services as well as one of the most important sources of capital for
foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country. In the fiscal year 2013, Chin
accounted for 61 percent of all foreign direct investment. Between 2007 and
2015, Chinese FDI increased from US$775 million to US$21.867 billion
accounting for 40 percent of all FDI in the country. Much of this investment
went into Burma's energy and mining industries. Chinese private firms account
for 87% percent of total legal cross-border trade at Ruili and have a
considerable amount of structural power over the illicit economy of Myanmar.
Chinese structural power over Burma's structure of finance also allows China
to maintain a dominant position within the country's natural resource sector,
primarily Burma's latent oil, gas, and uranium sectors. China's position as
the country's primary investor also allows it to be its largest consumer of
its extractive industries. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises have set their
sights on Burma's high-value natural resource industries such as raw jade
stones, teak and timber, rice, and marine fisheries.

### Foreign aid

The level of international aid to Burma ranks amongst the lowest in the world
(and the lowest in the Southeast Asian region)—Burma receives $4 per capita in
development assistance, as compared to the average of $42.30 per capita.

In April 2007, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified the
financial and other restrictions that the military government places on
international humanitarian assistance in the Southeast Asian country. The GAO
report, entitled "Assistance Programs Constrained in Burma," outlines the
specific efforts of the Burmese government to hinder the humanitarian work of
international organisations, including by restricting the free movement of
international staff within the country. The report notes that the regime has
tightened its control over assistance work since former Prime Minister Khin
Nyunt was purged in October 2004.

Furthermore, the reports states that the military government passed guidelines
in February 2006, which formalised Burma's restrictive policies. According to
the report, the guidelines require that programs run by humanitarian groups
"enhance and safeguard the national interest" and that international
organisations co-ordinate with state agents and select their Burmese staff
from government-prepared lists of individuals. United Nations officials have
declared these restrictions unacceptable.

> The shameful behavior of Burma's military regime in tying the hand of
> humanitarian organizations is laid out in these pages for all to see, and it
> must come to an end," said U.S. Representative Tom Lantos (D-CA). "In
> eastern Burma, where the military regime has burned or otherwise destroyed
> over 3,000 villages, humanitarian relief has been decimated. At least one
> million people have fled their homes and many are simply being left to die
> in the jungle."

US Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) said that the report "underscores
the need for democratic change in Burma, whose military regime arbitrarily
arrests, tortures, rapes and executes its own people, ruthlessly persecutes
ethnic minorities, and bizarrely builds itself a new capital city while
failing to address the increasingly urgent challenges of refugee flows,
illicit narcotics and human trafficking, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases."
