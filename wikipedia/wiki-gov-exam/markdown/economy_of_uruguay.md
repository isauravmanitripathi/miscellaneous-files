Historical GDP per capita development

The **economy of Uruguay** features an export-oriented agricultural sector and
a well-educated workforce, along with high levels of social spending. Tourism
and banking are also prominent sectors; Uruguay acts as a regional hub for
international finance and tourism. The country also has a history and
representation of advanced workers-rights protection, with unions and the
eight-hour work-day protected at the beginning of the 20th century.

90% of the country's population is urbanized, while most of the industry and
over half of the population is concentrated in the capital Montevideo.

After averaging growth of 5% annually during 1996–98, Uruguay's economy
suffered a major downturn in 1999–2002, stemming largely from the spillover
effects of the economic problems of its large neighbors; Argentina and Brazil.
In 2001–02, Argentine citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited
in Uruguayan banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen, which led to
a plunge in the Uruguayan peso, causing the 2002 Uruguay banking crisis.

## History

### 19th century

In the 19th century, the country had similar characteristics to other Latin
American countries: caudillismo, civil wars and permanent instability (40
revolts between 1830 and 1903), foreign capitalism's control of important
sectors of the economy, a high percentage of illiterate people (more than half
the population in 1900). Among foreign investments, investors from Great
Britain controlled 22% of the land and many majors parts of the industrial
infrastructure, including meatpacking and leather industry, infrastructure for
water and gas, and transport systems like trolley and 1100 miles of rail.

In 1857, the first nationally owned bank, Banco Comercial, was founded.

### Reforms after Batlle

José Batlle y Ordóñez, President from 1903 to 1907 and again from 1911 to
1915, set the pattern for Uruguay's modern political development and dominated
the political scene until he died in 1929. Batlle introduced widespread
political, social, and economic reforms such as a welfare program, government
participation in many facets of the economy, and a new constitution.

Batlle nationalized foreign-owned companies and created a modern social
welfare system. Income tax for lower incomes was abolished in 1905, secondary
schools established in every city (1906), telephone network nationalized,
unemployment benefits were introduced (1914), eight-hour working day
introduced (1915), etc. By 1929, 84% of manufacturing was concentrated in a
handful of industries: meatpacking, leather and wool. Industrial policies
further encouraging migration from rural to urban communities, as well as
waves of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. Investment in urban
infrastructure in Montevideo and a growing economy, was capped by hosting the
first 1930 FIFA World Cup.

Claudio Williman who served between Batlle's two terms was his supporter and
continued all his reforms, as did the next President Baltasar Brum
(1919–1923). Around 1900 infant mortality rates (IMR) in Uruguay were among
the world's lowest, indicating a very healthy population.

Uruguay was hit hard by the Great Depression, ending an era of export-led
economic growth.

### Mid-20th century

The Uruguay economy shifted from an agriculture-dominated economy to an
industrial economy from the period 1930 to 1955. This shift led to a sluggish
economy, as Uruguay neglected its comparative advantage, diverting resources
away from a productive agricultural sector to an inefficient, unproductive
manufacturing sector. The government sought to bolster its manufacturing
sector with import substitution industrialization, disincentivizing imports.
From the 1950s onwards, the Uruguay economy was in decline.

Anthropology professor Daniel Renfrew describes both the 50s and 60s and
dictatorship period (70s and 80s) as economic downturn periods, followed by
further economic degradation caused by neoliberalism. Economist Jamie Mezzera
disagrees with this interpretation, arguing that between 1968 and 1972,
Uruguay was one of the most regulated capitalist economies in the world. In
this period, the government massively increased import tariffs and had near-
total wage and price controls. The government instituted these policies to
avoid the political pressure that would come if they were to devalue their
currency. Between 1955 and 1972, economic output in Uruguay stagnated. After
the price and wage controls were largely removed in 1973, growth increased by
4.3% per year until 1979.

The policies of the Colorado Party under Julio María Sanguinetti and Jorge
Batlle during the 90s and early 2000s, following global trends of neo-
liberalization, facilitated a shift from manufacturing and small-scale
agriculture, towards increasing monoculture agriculture and services like
finance and tourism. However, these policies faded as the regional economic
problems in Argentina and Brazil caused a downturn and unemployment from 1998
to 2003. The economic and social crises that followed allowed for the election
of the Broad Front a leftist coalition against the neoliberal policies.

## Currency

Uruguay has a partially dollarized economy. As of August 2008[update] almost
60% of bank loans use United States dollars, but most transactions use the
Uruguayan peso. Today, the Uruguayan peso is minted in coins of 1, 2, 5, 10,
and 50 pesos and in banknotes of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 pesos.

## Sectors

### Agriculture, textiles and leather

Throughout Uruguay's history, their strongest exporting industries have been
beef and wool. In the case of beef exports, they have been boosted since
Uruguay joined the Mercosur agreement in 1991 and the country has been able
trade with more distant markets, such as Japan. In 2018, it produced 589
thousand tons of beef. In the case of wool exports, they have not been doing
so well in recent years suffering from other competitors in the market like
New Zealand and the fluctuations of its demand during the 2008 recession in
the developed world.

As timber refining is being kept within the country, forestry has become a
growth industry in recent years. In 2018, the country produced 1.36 million
tons of rice, 1.33 million tons of soy, 816 thousand tons of maize, 637
thousand tons of barley, 440 thousand tons of wheat, 350 thousand tons of
sugar cane, 106 thousand tons of orange, 104 thousand tons of grape, 90
thousand tons of rapeseed, 87 thousand tons of potato, 76 thousand tons of
sorghum, 71 thousand tons of tangerine, 52 thousand tons of oats, 48 thousand
tons of apple, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products.

Liebig Extract of Meat Company ran a very large and influential beef extract
factory in Fray Bentos for 100 years.

### Energy

Wind turbines in Tacuarembó DepartmentEnergy in Uruguay describes energy and
electricity production, consumption and import in Uruguay. As part of climate
mitigation measures and an energy transformation, Uruguay has converted over
98% of its electrical grid to sustainable energy sources (primarily solar,
wind, and hydro). Fossil fuels are primarily imported into Uruguay for
transportation, industrial uses and applications like domestic cooking. Four
hydroelectric dams provide much of the country's energy supply.

### Software

During the last decades the software industry has developed considerably. Many
start-ups have been very successful, such is the case of PedidosYa and DLocal.
Uruguay also exports software; the similar geographic longitude to that of the
United States makes it attractive for companies to outsource software
development to Uruguayan companies. Other notable Uruguayan software
enterprises are: Genexus, Códigos del Sur, Overactive.

### Mining

Although this is a sector that does not make substantial contributions to the
country's economy, in recent years there has been some activity in gold and
cement production, and also in the extraction of granite.

Artigas Department is well known for its amethyst and agate quartz varieties
mining. During 2010s 20 thousand tons of minerals were extracted with a value
of 9 million of US dollars, exported to Germany, United States, Brazil and
China.

### Plastics

In 2011, plastics were the second-largest non-agricultural industrial export
of the country.

### Telecommunications

Despite having poor levels of investment in the fixed-line sector, the small
size of Uruguay's population has enabled them to attain one of the highest
telecommunication density levels in South America and reach a 100%
digitalization of main lines. Although the telecommunications sector has been
under a state monopoly for some years, provisions have been made to introduce
liberalization and to allow for the entry of more firms into the cellular
sector.[_citation needed_]

### Travel and tourism

In 2013, travel and tourism accounted for 9.4% of the country's GDP. Their
tourist industry is mainly characterized for attracting visitors from
neighboring countries. Currently Uruguay's major attraction is the interior,
particularly located in the region around Punta del Este.

## Specialties

  * Cattle were introduced to Uruguay before its independence by Hernando Arias de Saavedra, the Spanish Governor of Buenos Aires in 1603. Beef exports in 2006 amounted to around 37% of Uruguayan exports.
  * Wool is a traditional product exported mainly to America, followed by the UK and India.
  * Milk and dairy products. Conaprole, National Cooperative of Milk Producers is the main exporter of dairy products in Latin America (in 2006). The area of the country dedicated to dairy food is located mainly in the southwest.
  * Rice. Fine varieties are produced in the lowlands in the east of the country close to Merin lake on the Uruguay-Brazil border. The national company Saman claims to be the main exporter in Latin America. Countries it exports to include Brazil, Iran, Peru, South Africa, Chile, Senegal, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, USA, Canada and China.
  * Tourism: Several seaside resorts, like Punta del Este or Punta del Diablo in the south-eastern departments of Maldonado and Rocha, regarded as a jet-set resort in South America, are main attractions of Uruguay. International cruises call at Montevideo from October to March every year. Also, Uruguay hosts many year-round international conferences. (The original GATT Uruguay Round concerning trade was, as its name suggests, hosted in Uruguay). Montevideo is home to the headquarters (secretariat) of [Mercosur], the Common Market of the South, whose full members are Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Venezuela, associate members Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
  * Software and consulting. Uruguay's well-educated workforce and lower-than-international wages have put Uruguay on the IT map. A product named GeneXus, originally created in Uruguay by a company called ArTech, is noteworthy. Other important developers and consultants include De Larrobla & Asociados, Greycon and Quanam. Tata Consultancy Services has its headquarters for the Spanish speaking world in Uruguay. Many of these companies have established in [1].

> America's outsourcing hub. In partnership with one of India's largest
> technology consulting firms, engineers in Montevideo work while their
> counterparts in Mumbai sleep." - The New York Times, Sep 22, 2006.

  * Banking Services. Banking has traditionally been one of the strongest service export sectors in the country. Uruguay was once dubbed "the Switzerland of America", mainly for its banking sector and stability. The largest bank in Uruguay is Banco República, or BROU, which is state-owned; another important state bank is the BHU. Almost 20 private banks, most of the branches of international banks, operate in the country (Banco Santander, ABN AMRO, Citibank, among others). There is also a myriad of brokers and financial-services bureaus, among them Ficus Capital, Galvin Sociedad de Bolsa, Europa Sociedad de Bolsa, Darío Cukier, GBU, Hordeñana & Asociados Sociedad de Bolsa, etc. Uruguay has fully recovered from the financial crisis that caused a run on its banks.[_citation needed_]
  * Public Sector: The state in Uruguay has an important role in the economy, Uruguay resisted the trend of privatization in Utilities and state-owned enterprises in the region. Several Referendums supported the state being in control of the most important utilities and energy companies. Some of the companies have a full monopoly warranted by law (like landline telephony, water), others compete freely with private operators (Insurance, mobile telephony, Banks). Most of them are dominant in the local market. There is strong debate in the Uruguayan society about their role and future. Some of them contributed to the Uruguay state treasury.[_citation needed_]
    * The most important state-owned companies are: Republica AFAP (Pension Fund), AFE (Railways), ANCAP (Energy), ANCO (Mail), Administracion Nacional de Puertos (Ports), ANTEL (Telecommunications: Telephony, Mobiles (ANCEL and Data ANTELDATA)), BHU (Mortgage Bank), BROU (Bank), BSE (Insurance), OSE (Water & Sewage), UTE (Electricity). These companies operate under public law, using a legal entity defined in the Uruguayan Constitution called 'Ente Autonomo' (Meaning Autonomic Entity). The government also owns parts of other companies operating under private law like the National Airline Carrier PLUNA and others owned totally or partially by the CND National Development Corporation.[_citation needed_]
