A per capita GDP of $3,200 ranks Solomon Islands as a lesser developed nation.
Over 75% of its labour force is engaged in subsistence farming and fishing.

## Economic history

A man sells fish at the central market in Honiara, 2013.

Until 1998, when world prices for tropical timber fell steeply, timber was
Solomon Islands main export product. In recent years, Solomon Islands forests
were dangerously overexploited.

Solomon Islands was particularly hard hit by the Asian financial crisis even
before the ethnic violence of June 2000. The Asian Development Bank estimates
that the crash of the market for tropical timber reduced Solomon Island's GDP
by between 15%-25%. About one-half of all jobs in the timber industry were
lost. The government has said it will reform timber harvesting policies with
the aim of resuming logging on a more sustainable basis.

In the wake of the ethnic violence in June 2000, exports of palm oil and gold
ceased while exports of timber fell.

## Economic sectors

### Cash crops

Important cash crops and exports include copra and palm oil.

### Gold

In 1998 gold production began at Gold Ridge on Guadalcanal.

### Fishing

Exploitation of Solomon Islands' rich fisheries offers the best prospect for
further export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture,
Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country,
closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant
has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has resume now but
under Soltuna and NFD.

### Tourism

In 2017, Solomon Islands was one of the least frequently visited countries in
the world, with only 26,000 tourists. Tourism income in 2016 and 2017 was
about Int'l$ 1.6 million (international dollars). Tourism is a potentially
significant service industry but growth is hampered by the lack of
infrastructure, transportation limitations and security concerns. Scuba diving
and World War II history are two major tourist attractions.[1] Archived

### Foreign aid

Since 2000 the Solomon Islands government has become increasingly insolvent.
It has exhausted its borrowing capacity; in 2001 the deficit reached 8% of
GDP. It is unable to meet bi-weekly payrolls and has become extraordinarily
dependent on funds from foreign aid accounts, which provided an estimated 50%
of government expenditure in 2001. Principal aid donors are Australia $247
Million per year (2006), New Zealand $14 Million per year (2004), the European
Union, Japan $40 Million per year (2005), and the Republic of China (Taiwan)
at least $20 Million per year .

Solomon Islands is a member of the WTO.

### Energy

**Electricity - consumption:** 72.54 GWh (2008 est.)

**Electricity - imports:** 0 kWh (2009)

A team of renewable energy developers working for the Pacific Islands Applied
Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and funded by the Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), have hatched a scheme that enables these
communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, without raising
substantial sums of ready cash. If the islanders were not able to pay for
solar lanterns with cash, reasoned the project developers, they can pay with
crops
