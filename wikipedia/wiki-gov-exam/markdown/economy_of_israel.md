The **economy of Israel** is a highly developed free-market economy. The
prosperity of Israel's advanced economy allows the country to have a
sophisticated welfare state, a powerful modern military said to possess a
nuclear-weapons capability with a full nuclear triad, modern infrastructure
equivalent to developed countries, and a high-technology sector competitively
on par with Silicon Valley. It has the second-largest number of startup
companies in the world after the United States,[_needs update_] and the third-
largest number of NASDAQ-listed companies after the U.S. and China. American
companies, such as Intel, Microsoft, and Apple, built their first overseas
research and development facilities in Israel. More than 400 high-tech multi-
national corporations, such as IBM, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems,
Facebook and Motorola have opened R&D centers throughout the country. As of
2025, the IMF estimated Israel has the 25th largest economy in the world by
nominal GDP, and one of the biggest economies in the Middle East.[1]

The country's major economic sectors are high-technology and industrial
manufacturing. The Israeli diamond industry is one of the world's centers for
diamond cutting and polishing, amounting to 21% of all exports in 2017. As the
country is relatively poor in natural resources, it consequently depends on
imports of petroleum, raw materials, wheat, motor vehicles, uncut diamonds and
production inputs. Nonetheless, the country's nearly total reliance on energy
imports may change in the future as recent discoveries of natural gas reserves
off its coast and the Israeli solar energy industry have taken a leading role
in Israel's energy sector.

Israel's quality higher education and the establishment of a highly motivated
and educated populace is largely responsible for ushering in the country's
high technology boom and rapid economic development by regional standards. The
country has developed a strong educational infrastructure and a high-quality
business startup incubation system for promoting cutting edge new ideas to
create value-driven goods and services. These developments have allowed the
country to create a high concentration of high-tech companies across the
country's regions. These companies are financially backed by a strong venture
capital industry. Its central high technology hub, the "Silicon Wadi", is
considered second in importance only to its Californian counterpart. Numerous
Israeli companies have been acquired by global multinational corporations for
their profit-driven technologies in addition to their reliable and quality
corporate personnel.

In its early decades, the Israeli economy was largely state-controlled and
shaped by social democratic ideas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the economy
underwent a series of free-market reforms and was gradually liberalized. In
the past three decades, the economy has grown considerably, though GDP per
capita has increased faster than wages. Israel is the most developed and
advanced country in West Asia, possessing the 17th largest foreign-exchange
reserves in the world and the highest average wealth per adult in the Middle
East (10th worldwide by financial assets per capita). Israel is the 9th
largest arm exporter in the world and has the highest number of billionaires
in the Middle East, ranked 18th in the world. In recent years, Israel has had
among the highest GDP growth rates within the developed world along with
Ireland. _The Economist_ ranked Israel as the 4th most successful economy
among developed countries for 2022. The IMF estimated Israel's GDP at US$564
billion and its GDP per capita at US$58,270 in 2023 (13th highest in the
world), a figure comparable to other highly developed countries. Israel was
invited to join the OECD in 2010. Israel has also signed free trade agreements
with the European Union, the United States, the European Free Trade
Association, Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Ukraine, Jordan, and Egypt. In 2007,
Israel became the first non-Latin-American country to sign a free trade
agreement with the Mercosur trade bloc.

## History

Change in per capita GDP of Israel since 1950. Figures are inflation-adjusted
to 2011 International dollars.

The British Mandate for Palestine that came into effect in 1920 aimed at
restricting land purchases by Jewish immigrants. For this reason, the Jewish
population was initially more urban and had a higher share in industrial
occupations. This particular development resulted economically in one of the
few growth miracles of the region whereby the structure of firms was
determined mainly by private businessmen rather than by the government. The
first survey of the Dead Sea in 1911, by the Russian Jewish businessman and
engineer Moshe Novomeysky, led to the establishment of Palestine Potash Ltd.
in 1930, later renamed the Dead Sea Works. In 1923, the businessman and
hydraulic engineer Pinhas Rutenberg was granted an exclusive concession for
the production and distribution of electric power. He founded the Palestine
Electric Company, later the Israel Electric Corporation. Between 1920 and
1924, some of the country's largest factories were established, including the
Shemen Oil Company, the Societe des Grand Moulins, the Palestine Silicate
Company and the Palestine Salt Company.

In 1937, there were 86 spinning and weaving factories in the country,
employing a workforce of 1,500. Capital and technical expertise were supplied
by Jewish professionals from Europe. The Ata textile plant in Kiryat Ata,
which went on to become an icon of the Israeli textile industry, was
established in 1934. In 1939, the cornerstone was laid for one of the kibbutz
industry's first factories: the Naaman brick factory, which supplied the
growing need for construction materials.

The textile underwent rapid development during World War II, when supplies
from Europe were cut off while local manufacturers were commissioned for army
needs. By 1943, the number of factories had grown to 250, with a workforce of
5,630, and output increased tenfold.

From 1924, trade fairs were held in Tel Aviv. The Levant Fair was inaugurated
in 1932.

### After independence

After statehood, Israel faced a deep economic crisis. As well as having to
recover from the devastating effects of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, it also had
to absorb hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Europe and almost a
million from the Arab world. Israel was financially overwhelmed and faced a
deep economic crisis, which led to a policy of austerity from 1949 to 1959.
Unemployment was high, and foreign currency reserves were scarce.

In 1952, Israel and West Germany signed an agreement stipulating that West
Germany was to pay Israel to compensate for Jewish property stolen by the
Nazis, material claims during the Holocaust, and absorption of refugees as a
result. Over the next 14 years, West Germany paid Israel 3 billion marks
(around US$714 million according to 1953–1955 conversion rates or equivalent
to approximately US$7 billion in modern currency). The reparations became a
decisive part of Israel's income, comprising as high as 87.5% of Israel's
income in 1956. Israel never had any formal diplomatic relations with East
Germany. In 1950, the Israeli government launched Israel Bonds for American
and Canadian Jews to buy. In 1951, the final results of the bonds program
exceeded $52 million. Additionally, many American Jews made private donations
to Israel, which in 1956 were thought to amount to $100 million a year. In
1957, bond sales amounted to 35% of Israel's special development budget. Later
in the century, Israel became significantly reliant on economic aid from the
United States, a country that also became Israel's most important source of
political support internationally.

The proceeds from these sources were invested in industrial and agricultural
development projects, which allowed Israel to become economically self-
sufficient. Among the projects made possible by the aid was the Hadera power
plant, the Dead Sea Works, the National Water Carrier, port development in
Haifa, Ashdod, and Eilat, desalination plants, and national infrastructure
projects.

After statehood, priority was given to establishing industries in areas slated
for development, among them, Lachish, Ashkelon, the Negev and Galilee. The
expansion of Israel's textile industry was a consequence of the development of
cotton growing as a profitable agricultural branch. By the late 1960s,
textiles were one of the largest industrial branches in Israel, second only to
the foodstuff industry. Textiles constituted about 12% of industrial exports,
becoming the second-largest export branch after polished diamonds. In the
1990s, cheap East Asian labor decreased the profitability of the sector. Much
of the work was subcontracted to 400 Israeli Arab sewing shops. As these
closed down, Israeli firms, among them Delta, Polgat, Argeman and Kitan, began
doing their sewing work in Jordan and Egypt, usually under the QIZ
arrangement. In the early 2000s, Israeli companies had 30 plants in Jordan.
Israeli exports reached $370 million a year, supplying such retailers and
designers as Marks & Spencer, The Gap, Victoria's Secret, Walmart, Sears,
Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Donna Karan.

In its first two decades of existence, Israel's strong commitment to
development led to economic growth rates that exceeded 10% annually. Between
1950 and 1963, the expenditure among wage-earner's families rose 97% in real
terms. Between 1955 and 1966, per capita consumption rose by 221%. In the
1970s, investment began to shift from agriculture and basic infrastructure to
industry and defense programs. These latter investments would later become the
foundation of Israel's technology sector. The years after the 1973 Yom Kippur
War were a lost decade economically, as growth stalled, inflation soared and
government expenditures rose significantly. Also worthy of mention is the 1983
Bank stock crisis. By 1984, the economic situation became almost catastrophic
with inflation reaching an annual rate close to 450% and projected to reach
over 1000% by the end of the following year. However, the successful economic
stabilization plan implemented in 1985 and the subsequent introduction of
market-oriented structural reforms reinvigorated the economy and paved the way
for its rapid growth in the 1990s and became a model for other countries
facing similar economic crises.

Israeli new shekel banknotes and coins

Two developments have helped to transform Israel's economy since the beginning
of the 1990s. The first is waves of Jewish immigration, predominantly from the
countries of the former USSR, that has brought over one million new citizens
to Israel. These new Soviet Jewish immigrants, many of them highly educated,
had a wellspring of scientific and technical expertise to help spur Israel's
burgeoning technology sector, now constitute some 15% of Israel's population.
The second development benefiting the Israeli economy is the peace process
that begun at the Madrid conference of October 1991, which led to the signing
of accords and later to a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan (1994).

Israeli New Shekel, new banknotes since 2018

During the early 2000s, the Israeli economy went into a downturn due to the
crashing of the global dot-com bubble which bankrupted many startups
established during the height of the bubble. The Second Intifada, which cost
Israel billions of dollars in security costs, and a decline in investment and
tourism, sent unemployment in Israel to the double digits; growth in one
quarter of 2000 was 10%. In 2002, the Israeli economy declined about 4% in one
quarter. Afterward, Israel managed to create a remarkable recovery by opening
up new markets to Israeli exporters farther afield, such as in the rapidly
growing countries of East Asia. This was possible thanks to a rebound in the
Israeli tech sector, spurred on by the gradual bottoming out of the dotcom
crash and a growing increase in demand for computer software, which in turn
was due to burgeoning rates of global internet usage at this time. The
explosion in demand for security and defense products following 9/11 also
allowed Israel to sell even more of its technologies abroad – a situation only
made possible due to Israel's prior investments in the technology sector in an
effort to curb high levels of domestic unemployment.

In the 2000s, there was an influx of foreign investment in Israel from
companies that formerly shunned the Israeli market. In 2006, foreign
investment in Israel totalled $13 billion, according to the Manufacturers
Association of Israel. The _Financial Times_ said that "bombs drop, yet
Israel's economy grows". Moreover, while Israel's total gross external debt is
US$95 billion, or approximately 41.6% of GDP, since 2001 it has become a net
lender nation in terms of net external debt (the total value of assets vs.
liabilities in debt instruments owed abroad), which as of June 2012[update]
stood at a significant surplus of US$60 billion. The country also maintains a
current account surplus in an amount equivalent to about 3% of its gross
domestic product in 2010. In 2023, Israel's account surplus was 25.3 billion
U.S. dollars.

Bank of Israel

The Israeli economy weathered and withstood the late-2000s recession,
registering positive GDP growth in 2009 and ending the decade with an
unemployment rate lower than that of many of its Western counterparts. There
are several reasons behind this economic resilience, for example, the fact
that the country is a net lender rather than a borrower nation and the
government and the Bank of Israel's generally conservative macro-economic
policies. Two policies, in particular, can be cited, one is the refusal of the
government to succumb to pressure by the banks to appropriate large sums of
public money to aid them early in the crisis, thus limiting their risky
behavior. The second is the implementation of the recommendations of the
Bach'ar commission in the early to mid-2000s which recommended decoupling the
banks' depository- and Investment banking activities, contrary to the then-
opposite trend, particularly in the United States, of easing such restrictions
which had the effect of encouraging more risk-taking in the financial systems
of those countries. American investors today make up the most significant
portion of investors in Israel.

### OECD membership

In May 2007, Israel was invited to open accession discussions with the OECD.
In May 2010, the OECD voted unanimously to invite Israel to join, despite
Palestinian objections. It became a full member on 7 September 2010. The OECD
praised Israel's scientific and technological progress and described it as
having "produced outstanding outcomes on a world scale."

## Challenges

Despite economic prosperity, the Israeli economy faces many challenges, some
short-term and some long-term. In the short term, its inability to duplicate
its success in the telecommunication industry in other growing industries
hampers its economic outlook. Its inability to foster large multinational
companies in the last decade also calls into question its ability to employ
many people in advanced industries. On the long term, Israel is facing
challenges of high dependency on the growing number of Ultra-Orthodox Jews,
who have a low level of official labor force participation among men. This
situation could lead to a materially lower employment-to-population ratio and
a higher dependency ratio in the future. The governor of the Bank of Israel,
Stanley Fischer, stated that the growing poverty amongst the Ultra-Orthodox is
hurting the Israeli economy. According to the data published by Ian Fursman,
60% of the poor households in Israel are of the Haredi Jews and the Israeli
Arabs. Together, these two groups represent 25–28% of the Israeli population.
Organizations such as The Kemach Foundation, Gvahim, Jerusalem Village, and
The Jerusalem Business Networking Forum are addressing these challenges with
job placement services and networking events.

### 2023 Israel–Gaza war

After the Gaza war, the Israeli stock markets and currency nosedived. It is
estimated that Israel will lose around $400 billion in the next decade and
experience a significant economic shock. Ninety percent of this will result
from indirect consequences such as reduced investment, labor market
disruptions, and hindered productivity growth. On August 2024, Fitch Ratings
downgraded Israel's credit rating. The Bank of Israel has counted war-related
costs from 2023 to 2025 at up to $55.6 billion. Another consequence of the war
was that consumer spending dropped by 27%, imports fell by 42%, and exports
declined by 18%.

### Wealth Migrate

The 2024 Henley & Partners Report, indicates that around 1,700 millionaires
have departed the country since 2023, seeking investment migration
opportunities to mitigate risks and explore alternative residency options. The
report announced a remarkable 232% increase in investment migration
applications from Israeli citizens in 2023. Factors driving this trend include
a 5% depreciation in the shekel's value against the US dollar, a 10% decline
in real estate prices in Tel Aviv, Israel's growing international isolation,
and the financial pressure resulting from the war in 2023.

### Red Sea crisis

The Red Sea crisis caused by the Houthi attacks has severely affected the
Israeli economy, disrupting shipping routes, increasing costs, and causing job
losses. The port of Eilat, Israel's southern gateway, has suffered almost shut
down and bankruptcy, leading to requests for government support. Half of the
port's workers were at risk of losing their jobs. Many ships are avoiding the
Red Sea and rerouting around Africa, which makes the journey three weeks
longer and more expensive. Insurance costs for ships in the Red Sea surged,
with some Israeli ships seeing a 250% increase or being denied coverage
altogether.

### Boycotts of Israel

On 19 July 2024, the International Court of Justice released an important
advisory opinion stating that countries must not recognize, assist, or support
the illegal circumstances arising from Israel's occupation of Palestinian
territories. The court declared that all nations must avoid any economic or
trade relations with Israel concerning the Occupied Palestinian territories
(OPT) or any areas that could reinforce its unlawful presence there.
Additionally, it emphasized the need to take steps to prevent trade or
investment activities that contribute to sustaining the illegal situation
established by Israel in the OPT. On May 26, 2023, the European Trade Union
Confederation (ETUC), which represents over 45 million workers and their trade
unions across Europe, announced a boycott of products made in illegal Israeli
settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The ETUC emphasized the
need for regulatory measures to ban the import and export of goods produced in
these illicit settlements by entities within the European Union, as stipulated
by EU treaties and international law.

### 2023 Israeli judicial reform

Following the 2023 Israeli judicial reform, banks in the country experienced a
significant surge in fund withdrawals, occurring at a rate ten times higher
than normal. Executives warned that these political changes could adversely
affect the economy, resulting in a decline in the shekel's value and a loss of
investor confidence. A report from The Times of Israel on March 5, 2023, noted
that as the shekel depreciated against the dollar and euro, the Tel Aviv Stock
Exchange fell compared to stock markets in the EU and the US. Numerous
companies, particularly in the technology sector, have withdrawn their
investments from Israel, leading to an outflow of over $4 billion in just a
few weeks.

## Sectors

### Agriculture

The Kibbutzim, collective communities in Israel traditionally based on
agriculture, played an important role in Israel's economy until the late
1970s.

In 2017, 2.4% of the country's GDP is derived from agriculture. Of a total
labor force of 2.7 million, 2.6% are employed in agricultural production while
6.3% in services for agriculture. While Israel imports substantial quantities
of grain (approximately 80% of local consumption), it is largely self-
sufficient in other agricultural products and foodstuffs. For centuries,
farmers of the region have grown varieties of citrus fruits, such as
grapefruit, oranges and lemons. Citrus fruits are still Israel's major
agricultural export. In addition, Israel is one of the world's leading
greenhouse-food-exporting countries. Israel also produces and exports flowers
and cotton. The country exports more than $1.3 billion worth of agricultural
products every year, including farm produce as well as $1.2 billion worth of
agricultural inputs and technology. Israeli technological innovations in
agriculture and water technology have given the Israeli AgTech sector a
competitve edge and allows Israeli agtech companies to operate in numerous
countries around the world.

### Financial services

Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP) compound in Jerusalem, one of Israel's
largest venture capital firms

Israel has over 100 active venture capital funds operating throughout the
country with US$10 billion under management. In 2004, international foreign
funds from various nations around the world committed over 50 percent of the
total dollars invested exemplifying the country's strong and sound reputation
as an internationally sought after foreign investment by many countries.
Israel's venture capital sector has rapidly developed from the early 1990s,
and has about 70 active venture capital funds (VC), of which 14 international
VCs have Israeli offices. Israel's thriving venture capital and business-
incubator industry played an important role in financing the country's
flourishing high-tech sector. In 2008, venture capital investment in Israel,
rose 19 percent to $1.9 billion.

The Yozma Fund kick-started the venture capital industry in Israel during the
1990s, raising ~$8 billion total.

"Between 1991 and 2000, Israel's annual venture-capital outlays, nearly all
private, rose nearly 60-fold, from $58 million to $3.3 billion; companies
launched by Israeli venture funds rose from 100 to 800; and Israel's
information-technology revenues rose from $1.6 billion to $12.5 billion. By
1999, Israel ranked second only to the United States in invested private-
equity capital as a share of GDP. Israel led the world in the share of its
growth attributable to high-tech ventures: 70 percent."

Israel's thriving venture capital industry has played an important role in
funding the country's booming high-technology sector, with hundreds of
prosperous Israeli private equity and venture capital firms. The 2008
financial crisis negatively affected the availability of venture capital
locally. In 2009, there were 63 mergers and acquisitions in the Israeli market
worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82
Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds
($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired. Numerous
Israeli high tech companies have been acquired by various global multinational
corporations for their ability to produce profit-driven technologies in
addition to their arsenal of reliable corporate management and quality
administrative personnel. In addition to venture capital funds, many of the
world's leading investment banks, pension funds, and insurance companies have
a strong presence in Israel committing their funds to financially back Israeli
high-tech firms and benefit from its prosperous high tech sector. These
institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank, JP
Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch, CalPERS, Ontario Teachers
Pension Plan, and AIG.

Israel also has a small but fast growing hedge fund industry. Within five
years between 2007 and 2012, the number of active hedge funds doubled to 60.
Israel-based hedge funds have registered an increase of 162% from 2006 to
2012, when they managed a total of $2 billion (₪8 billion) and employed about
300 people. The ever-growing hedge fund industry in Israel is also attracting
a myriad of investors from around the world, particularly from the United
States.

In 2022, Tel Aviv was ranked 53rd on the Global Financial Centres Index.

In 2023, despite the occurrence of war and significant events like a legal
reform and interest rate rise that shook the capital market and created
uncertainty, about 40% of the companies traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
continued to distribute dividends to their shareholders. This was particularly
evident in the energy, oil and gas industries, and in the banking and
financial services sector. The year marked a record in the total dividend
distributed to public shareholders, with about 62% of the distributed amount
(16.8 billion shekels), compared to about 55% of the dividends (15.8 billion
shekels) in 2022, with the remainder being paid to stakeholders. The average
dividend yield of the exchange-listed companies in 2023 was approximately
2.9%, compared to about 2.8% in the previous year. This was the highest return
since 2017 and higher than that of 2022, the record year, as the average
market value in 2023 was about 9% lower than in 2022, while the total dividend
was only about 5% lower than the previous year.

### High technology

Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot

Science and technology in Israel is one of the country's most highly developed
and industrialized sectors. The modern Israeli ecosystem of high technology is
highly optimized making up a significant bulk of the Israeli economy. The
percentage of Israelis engaged in scientific and technological inquiry, and
the amount spent on research and development (R&D) concerning gross domestic
product (GDP), is among the highest in the world, with 140 scientists and
technicians per 10,000 employees. In comparison, the same is 85 per 10,000 in
the United States and 83 per 10,000 in Japan. Israel ranks fourth in the world
in scientific activity, as measured by the number of scientific publications
per million citizens. Israel's percentage of the total number of scientific
articles published worldwide is almost 10 times higher than its percentage of
the world's population. The country is home to over 1,400 life science
companies, including about 300 pharmaceutical companies, 600 medical device
companies, 450 digital health companies, and 468 biotechnology companies.
Israeli scientists, engineers, and technicians have contributed to the modern
advancement of the natural sciences, agricultural sciences, computer sciences,
electronics, genetics, medicine, optics, solar energy and various fields of
engineering. The country has one of the world's technologically most literate
populations. Israel has the second largest number of startup companies
globally, behind only the United States, and remains one of the largest
centers in the world for technology start-up enterprises. As of 2013, around
200 start-ups were being created annually in Israel. In 2019, there were
nearly 7,000 active start-ups operating throughout the country. In 2021, there
were 79 Israeli-established tech unicorns, with 32 of them headquartered in
Israel. More than one-third of cybersecurity unicorns in the world were
Israeli in 2021. Israel is also home to nearly 400 research and development
centers owned by various multinational companies, including prominent high-
technology giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Intel.

Israel is also a major semiconductor design hub. The country is home to
numerous chip design centers owned by major multinational corporations, and is
considered as having one of the most advanced chip design industries in the
world. In 2021, a total of 37 multinational corporations were operating in
Israel in the semiconductor field.

In 1998, Tel Aviv was named by _Newsweek_ as one of the ten technologically
most influential cities in the world. In 2012, the city was also named one of
the best places for high-tech startup companies, placed second behind its
California counterpart. In 2013, _The Boston Globe_ ranked Tel Aviv as the
second-best city for business start-ups, after Silicon Valley. In 2020,
StartupBlink ranked Israel as having the third best startup ecosystem in the
world, behind only the United States and United Kingdom.

As a result of the country's highly prolific and dynamic start-up culture,
Israel is often referred to as the "Start-Up Nation." and the "Silicon Valley
of the Middle East". Programs that send people to Israel to explore the
"Start-Up Nation" economy include TAVtech Ventures and TAMID Group. This
success has been attributed by some to widespread service in the Israel
Defense Forces and its development of talent which then fuels the high-tech
industry upon discharge.

In recent years, the industry has faced a shortage of technology specialists;
15% of positions in the high technology sector of Israel were unfilled as of
2019. However, the largest number of unfilled job positions (31%) are in
software engineering specialities: DevOps, back-end, data science, machine
learning and artificial intelligence. Therefore, salaries of specialists in
the Israeli market also increased significantly. To solve this problem, IT
companies look for filling the gaps abroad. Consequently, they employ about
25% of their entire workforce overseas. Most companies choose to hire
employees from Ukraine (45%) and the United States (with 16%) are the second
most popular offshoring destination country. In 2017, the Council for Higher
Education in Israel launched a five-year program to increase the number of
graduates from computer science and engineering programs by 40%.

### Energy

Known oil and gas fields in the Levant Basin (US EIA) Consumption of fossil
fuel energy sources in Israel since 1980. Coal consumption rose steadily since
1980 when it was negligible. Natural gas consumption was nearly zero in 2003
and has risen steadily since.

Historically, Israel relied on external imports for meeting most of its energy
needs, spending an amount equivalent to over 5% of its GDP per year in 2009 on
imports of energy products. The transportation sector relies mainly on
gasoline and diesel fuel, while the majority of electricity production is
generated using imported coal. As of 2013, Israel was importing about 100 mln
barrels of oil per year. The country possesses negligible reserves of crude
oil but does have domestic natural gas resources which were discovered in more
significant quantities starting in 2009, after many decades of previously
unsuccessful exploration.

#### Natural gas

Until the early 2000s, natural gas use in Israel was minimal. In the late
1990s, the government of Israel decided to encourage the usage of natural gas
because of environmental, cost, and resource diversification reasons. At the
time however, there were no domestic sources of natural gas and the
expectation was that gas would be supplied from overseas in the form of LNG
and by a future pipeline from Egypt (which eventually became the
Arish–Ashkelon pipeline). Plans were made for the Israel Electric Corporation
to construct several natural gas-driven power plants, for erecting a national
gas distribution grid, and for an LNG import terminal.

Natural Gas Usage in Israel  2004  | 2005  | 2006  | 2007  | 2008  | 2009  | 2010  | 2014  | 2016  | 2018* | 2020* | 2022* | 2024* | 2026* | 2028* | 2030*  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Figures are in Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) per year. *Projected  
  
#### Recent discoveries

In 2000, a 33-billion-cubic-metre (BCM), or 1,200-billion-cubic-foot, natural-
gas field was located offshore Ashkelon, with commercial production starting
in 2004. As of 2014[update] however, this field is nearly depleted—earlier
than expected due to increased pumping to partially compensate for the loss of
imported Egyptian gas in the wake of unrest associated with the fall of the
Mubarak regime in 2011. In 2009, a significant gas find named Tamar, with
proven reserves of 223 BCM or 7.9×10~~^~~ 12 cu ft (307 BCM total proven +
probable) was located in deep water approximately 90 km (60 mi) west of Haifa,
as well as a smaller 15 BCM (530×10~~^~~ 9 cu ft) field situated nearer the
coastline. Furthermore, results of 3D seismic surveys and test drilling
conducted since 2010 have confirmed that an estimated 621 BCM (21.9×10~~^~~ 12
cu ft) natural-gas deposit named Leviathan exists in a large underwater
geological formation nearby the large gas field already discovered in 2009.

The Tamar field began commercial production on 30 March 2013 after four years
of development. The supply of gas from Tamar was expected to aid the Israeli
economy, which had suffered losses of more than ₪20 billion between 2011 and
2013 resulting from the disruption of gas supplies from neighboring Egypt (and
which are not expected to resume due to Egypt's decision to indefinitely
suspend its gas supply agreement to Israel). As a result, Israel, as well as
its other neighbor Jordan, which also suffered from disruption of gas
deliveries from Egypt, had to resort to importing significantly more expensive
and polluting liquid heavy fuels as substitute sources of energy. The ensuing
energy crisis in Israel was lifted once the Tamar field came online in 2013,
while Jordan committed to a US$10 billion, 15-year gas supply deal totaling 45
BCM from the Israeli Leviathan field which is scheduled to come online in late
2019. The agreement is estimated to save Jordan US$600 million per year in
energy costs. In 2018, the owners of the Tamar and Leviathan fields announced
that they are negotiating an agreement with a consortium of Egyptian firms for
the supply of up to 64 BCM of gas over 10 years valued at up to US$15 billion.
In early 2012 the Israeli cabinet announced plans to set up a sovereign wealth
fund (called "the Israeli Citizens' Fund").

Field  | Discovered  | Production  | Estimated size   
---|---|---|---  
Noa North  | 1999  | 2012 to 2014  | originally, 50 billion cubic feet (1.4 billion cubic metres); field depleted   
Mari-B  | 2000  | 2004 to 2015  | originally, 1 trillion cubic feet (28 billion cubic metres); field depleted   
Tamar | 2009  | 2013  | 10.8 trillion cubic feet (310 billion cubic metres)   
Dalit  | 2009  | Not in production  | 700 billion cubic feet (20 billion cubic metres)

#### Electricity

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to
reflect recent events or newly available information. _( February 2020)_  
---|---  
  
Since the founding of the state through the mid-2010s decade, the state-owned
utility, Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) had an effective monopoly on power
generation in the country. In 2010 the company sold 52,037 GWh of electricity.
Until the mid-2010s the country also faced a persistently low operating
reserve, which is mostly the result of Israel being an "electricity island".
Most countries have the capability of relying on power drawn from producers in
adjacent countries in the event of a power shortage. Israel's grid however, is
unconnected to those of neighboring countries. This is mostly due to political
reasons but also to the considerably less-developed nature of the power
systems of Jordan and Egypt, whose systems constantly struggle to meet
domestic demand and whose per-capita electric generation is less than one
fifth that of Israel's. Nevertheless, while operating reserves in Israel were
low, the country possessed sufficient generation and transmission capacity to
meet domestic electricity needs and unlike in the countries surrounding it,
rolling blackouts have historically been quite rare, even at periods of
extreme demand.

Facing the increasing demand for electricity and concerned about the low
reserve situation, the government of Israel began taking steps to increase the
supply of electricity and operating reserve, as well to reduce the monopoly
position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market
starting in the second half of the 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to
construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the
generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed
electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then
possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW).
Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired
combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2
GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration
facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are
licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national
grid at competitive rates. Also under construction is a 300 MW pumped storage
facility, with two more in planning, plus several solar-powered plants.

In addition to the above steps, Israel and Cyprus are considering implementing
the proposed EuroAsia Interconnector project. This consists of laying a 2000MW
HVDC undersea power cable between them and between Cyprus and Greece, thus
connecting Israel to the greater European power grid. If carried out, this
will allow a further increase in the country's operating reserve as well as
sell surplus electricity abroad.

In 2016, total nationwide electricity production was 67.2 GWh, of which 55.2%
was generated using natural gas and 43.8% using coal – the first time the
share of electricity production using natural gas exceeded that generated
using coal.

Share of Total Electricity Generation Capacity at Full Output  
by Plant Type and Fuel Types Used by the IEC in 2010  | Coal  | Fuel oil | Natural gas  | Diesel  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Installed capacity by plant type** | 39.7%  | 3.4%  | 39.8%  | 18.9%   
**Total annual generation by fuel source** | 61.0%  | 0.9%  | 36.6%  | 1.5%   
  
#### Solar power

The Negev Desert is home to the Israeli solar research industry, in particular
the National Solar Energy Center and the Arava Valley, which is the sunniest
area of Israel.

Solar power in Israel and the Israeli solar energy industry has a history that
dates to the founding of the country. In the 1950s, Levi Yissar developed a
solar water heater to help assuage an energy shortage in the new country. By
1967 around one in twenty households heated their water with the sun and
50,000 solar heaters had been sold. With the 1973 oil crisis, Harry Zvi Tabor,
the father of Israel's solar industry, developed the prototype solar water
heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes.

### Industrial manufacturing

Israel has a large industrial capacity. It has a well-developed chemical
industry with many of its products aimed at the export market. Most of the
chemical plants are located in Ramat Hovav, the Haifa Bay area and near the
Dead Sea. Israel Chemicals is one of the largest fertilizer and chemical
companies in Israel and its subsidiary, the Dead Sea Works in Sdom is the
world's fourth-largest producer and supplier of potash products. The company
also produces other products such as magnesium chloride, industrial salts, de-
icers, bath salts, table salt, and raw materials for the cosmetic industry.
Industrial production of metals, machinery and electrical equipment,
construction materials, consumer goods, and textiles, as well as food
processing also form a significant part of the manufacturing sector. Machinery
and equipment manufactured in Israel includes computer equipment, medical
equipment, agricultural equipment, and robots. Israel has a successful
semiconductor device fabrication industry, with several semiconductor
manufacturing facilities in the country.

One of the country's largest employers is Israel Aerospace Industries which
produces mainly aviation, space, and defense products. In 2017 the company had
an order backlog of 11.4 billion US dollars. There are numerous other
aerospace companies. Israeli aerospace companies are primarily sub-suppliers,
focusing on fields such as machining, electronic systems and components, and
composite materials. Israel is a major manufacturer and exporter of unmanned
aerial vehicles. Israel also has a significant pharmaceutical industry and is
home to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, one of the world's largest
pharmaceutical companies, which employed 40,000 people as of 2011. It
specializes in generic and proprietary pharmaceuticals and active
pharmaceutical ingredients. It is the largest generic drug manufacturer in the
world and one of the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. In
addition, Israel also has a shipbuilding industry through the company Israel
Shipyards, which has one of the largest shipbuilding and repair facilities in
the Eastern Mediterranean. For the civilian market, it builds merchant ships
and other civilian watercraft as well as machinery for ports and heavy
industries. It also builds naval craft for the defense market.

#### Diamond industry

Israel is one of the world's three major centers for polished diamonds,
alongside Belgium and India. Israel's net polished diamond exports slid 22.8
percent in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to $5.56 billion from $7.2
billion in 2011. Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 20.1 percent to $2.8
billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 24.9 percent to $4.3
billion, while net rough diamond imports dropped 12.9 percent to $3.8 billion.
Net exports and imports dropped during the Great Recession, particularly
within the Eurozone, affected by the European sovereign-debt crisis, and the
United States. The United States is the largest market accounting for 36% of
overall export market for polished diamonds while Hong Kong remains at second
with 28 percent and Belgium at 8 percent coming in third. As of 2016[update],
cut diamonds were Israel's largest export product, comprising 23.2% of all
exports.

#### Defense contracting

Israel is one of the world's major exporters of military equipment, accounting
for 10% of the world total in 2007. Three Israeli companies were listed on the
2010 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute index of the world's top
100 arms-producing and military service companies: Elbit Systems, Israel
Aerospace Industries and RAFAEL. The Defense industry in Israel is a
strategically important sector and a large employer within the country. It is
also a major player in the global arms market and is the 11th largest arms
exporter in the world as of 2012. Total arms transfer agreements topped 12.9
billion between 2004 and 2011. Israeli defense equipment exports have reached
7 billion U.S. dollars in 2012, making it a 20 percent increase from the
amount of defense-related exports in 2011. Much of the exports are sold to the
United States and Europe. Other major regions that purchase Israeli defense
equipment include Southeast Asia and Latin America. India is also major
country for Israeli arms exports and has remained Israel's largest arms market
in the world. Israel is considered to be the leading UAV exporter in the
world. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
Israeli defense companies were behind 41% of all drones exported in 2001–2011.
Israel's defense exports in 2021 reached US$11.2 billion in sales. Exports to
Arab countries that joined the Abraham Accords made up 7% of all Israeli
defense exports.

### Tourism

Israel is a major tourist destination, especially for those of Jewish
ancestry, with 4.55 million foreign tourists visiting the country in 2019
(about one tourist per two Israelis), yielding a 25% growth since 2016 and
contributed ₪20 billion to the economy, making it an all-time record at that
time. The most popular paid visited site is Masada.

## External trade

Map of Israeli exports in 2016

In 2016, Israeli goods exports totaled US$55.8 billion. It imported US$61.9
billion worth of goods in the same year. In 2017 total exports (goods and
services) amounted to US$102.3 billion, while imports totaled $96.7 billion.
Israel usually posts a modest trade deficit in goods. Its main goods imports
consist of raw materials, crude oil, production inputs and finished consumer
goods. Most of its exports are high-value-added items such as electronic
components and other high-technology equipment, tools, and machinery, cut
diamonds, refined petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. It normally posts a
substantial trade surplus in services thanks to tourism and service industries
such as software development, engineering services, and biomedical and
scientific research and development. Therefore, overall external trade is
positive, contributing to a significant current account surplus which as of
2017 stood at 4.7% of GDP.

The United States is Israel's largest trading partner, and Israel is the
United States' 26th-largest trading partner; two-way trade totaled some $24.5
billion in 2010, up from $12.7 billion in 1997. The principal U.S. exports to
Israel include computers, integrated circuits, aircraft parts and other
defense equipment, wheat, and automobiles. Israel's chief exports to the U.S.
include cut diamonds, jewelry, integrated circuits, printing machinery, and
telecommunications equipment. The two countries signed a free trade agreement
(FTA) in 1985 that progressively eliminated tariffs on most goods traded
between the two countries over the following ten years. An agricultural trade
accord was signed in November 1996, which addressed the remaining goods not
covered in the FTA. Some non-tariff barriers and tariffs on goods remain,
however. Israel also has trade and cooperation agreements in place with the
European Union and Canada, and is seeking to conclude such agreements with a
number of other countries, including Turkey, Jordan and several countries in
Eastern Europe.

In regional terms, the European Union is the top destination for Israeli
exports. In the four-month period between October 2011 and January 2012,
Israel exported goods totalling $5 billion to the EU – amounting to 35% of
Israel's overall exports. During the same period, Israeli exports to East Asia
and the Far East totaled some $3.1 billion.

Until 1995, Israel's trade with the Arab world was minimal due to the Arab
League boycott, which was begun against the Jewish community of Palestine in
1945. Arab nations not only refused to have direct trade with Israel (the
primary boycott), but they also refused to do business with any corporation
that operated in Israel (secondary boycott), or any corporation that did
business with a corporation that did business with Israel (tertiary boycott).

In 2013, commercial trade between Israel and the Palestinian territories were
valued at US$20 billion annually.

In 2012, ten companies were responsible for 47.7% of Israel's exports. These
companies were Intel Israel, Elbit Systems, Oil Refineries Ltd, Teva
Pharmaceuticals, Iscar, Israel Chemicals, Makhteshim Agan, Paz Oil Company,
Israel Aerospace Industries and the Indigo division of Hewlett-Packard. The
Bank of Israel and Israel's Export Institute have warned that the country is
too dependent on a small number of exporters.
