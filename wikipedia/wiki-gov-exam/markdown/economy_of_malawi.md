The **economy ofMalawi** is $7.522 billion by gross domestic product as of
2019, and is predominantly agricultural, with about 80% of the population
living in rural areas. The landlocked country in south central Africa ranks
among the world's least developed countries and poorest countries.
Approximately 50% of the population lives below the national poverty line,
with 25% living in extreme poverty.

In 2017, agriculture accounted for about one-third of GDP and about 80% of
export revenue. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic
assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor nations. The IMF
and World Bank has spearheaded structural reforms in Malawi for decades.

The government faces strong challenges: to spur exports, to improve
educational and health facilities, to face up to environmental problems of
deforestation and erosion, and to deal with the problem of HIV/AIDS in Africa.

## Agriculture

Malawi's most important export crop is tobacco, which accounted for a third
(30%) of export revenue in 2012. In 2000, the country was the tenth-largest
producer in the world. The country's heavy reliance on tobacco places a heavy
burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community
increases pressure to limit tobacco production. Malawi's dependence on tobacco
is growing, with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues
between 2007 and 2008.

A Malawi tea estate

The country also relies heavily on tea, sugarcane and coffee, with these three
plus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi's export revenue. Tea was first
introduced in 1878. Most of it is grown in Mulanje and Thyolo. Other crops
include cotton, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats. Tobacco and sugar
processing are notable secondary industries.

Traditionally Malawi has been self-sufficient in its staple food, maize
(corn), and during the 1980s it exported substantial quantities to its
drought-stricken neighbors. Nearly 90% of the population engages in
subsistence farming. Smallholder farmers produce a variety of crops, including
maize, beans, rice, cassava, tobacco, and groundnuts (peanuts). Financial
wealth is generally concentrated in the hands of a small elite. Malawi's
manufacturing industries are situated around the city of Blantyre.

Lake Malawi and Lake Chilwa provide most of the fish for the region. For many
Malawians, fish is the most important source of proteins. Dried fish is not
only consumed locally, but also exported to neighboring countries. Most
fishing is done on small scale by hand. However, Maldeco Fisheries owns
several commercial fishing boats and operates fish farms in the southern part
of Lake Malawi.

Malawi has few exploitable mineral resources. A South-African Australian
consortium exploits uranium at a mine near Karonga. Coal is being extracted in
Mzimba District. Malawi's economic reliance on the export of agricultural
commodities renders it particularly vulnerable to external shocks such as
declining terms of trade and drought. High transport costs, which can comprise
over 30% of its total import bill, constitute a serious impediment to economic
development and trade. Malawi must import all its fuel products. Other
challenges include a paucity of skilled labor, difficulty in obtaining
expatriate employment permits, bureaucratic red tape, corruption, and
inadequate and deteriorating road, electricity, water, and telecommunications
infrastructure which hinder economic development in Malawi. However, recent
government initiatives targeting improvements in the road infrastructure,
together with private sector participation in railroad and telecommunications,
have begun to render the investment environment more attractive.

## Industry

In 2013, Malawi's manufacturing sector contributed 10.7% of GDP. The main
industries are food processing, construction, consumer goods, cement,
fertilizer, ginning, furniture production and cigarette production.

The government's attempts to diversify the agriculture sector and move up the
global value chain have been seriously constrained by poor infrastructure, an
inadequately trained work force and a weak business climate. In order to help
companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the _National Export
Strategy_ adopted in 2013 affords companies greater access to the outcome of
international research and better information about available technologies; it
also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from
sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi
Innovation Challenge Fund. In parallel, the government has raised its
investment in research and development to 1% of GDP.

### Food and beverages

Most fruits and vegetables are exported raw, while processed food is imported
mainly from South Africa. Carlsberg opened its first brewery outside of
Denmark in Blantyre in 1965. The brewery also bottles Coca-Cola products under
licence. A mango processing plant for the export of fruit concentrate opened
in Salima in 2013. Universal Industries operates several food factories in
Blantyre, where it produces sweets, crisps, biscuits, milk powder, soy
products and baby food. Coffee and tea are processed by half a dozen of
different companies in the regions of Thyolo, Mulanje and around Mzuzu.

### Pharmaceutical companies

Malawi has four pharmaceutical companies. They manufacture a limited range of
drugs, particularly those that are in great demand on the local market. These
are Pharmanova Ltd., which is the biggest pharmaceutical manufacturer in
Malawi, followed by SADM, Malawi Pharmacies (Pharmaceuticals Limited) and
Kentam Products Limited.

### Forestry

Large man-made pine tree forests are located in the Viphya Mountains, around
Mulanje and Zomba. Timber production for building materials and furniture is
an important industry for these regions. However, most areas in Malawi suffer
from deforestation due to illegal logging for charcoal production and the use
of firewood.

### Electricity

Malawi's sole power supplier is the state owned Electricity Supply Commission
of Malawi (ESCOM), which generates almost all its power from hydroelectric
plants along the Shire River. The installed is approximately 351MW. About 12%
of the country's population has access to electricity, according to 2014 World
Bank figures.

The country has been suffering from intermittent power outages as a result of
an ongoing drought that has halved power output as water levels of the Shire
river dropped significantly. The river usually generates 300MW of electricity,
accounting for 98% of Malawi's total supply. However, the drought reduced that
capacity to 160MW, according to ESCOM.

## Services

The service sector accounts for 51.7% of Malawi's national GDP. Notable
industries are tourism, retail, transport, education, health services,
telecommunication and the banking sector. The Government of Malawi holds
shares in many important companies, such as Malawian Airlines (51%) and Press
Corporation Limited. Press Corporation Ltd. is the country's biggest company,
with subsidiaries in the tobacco, banking, sugar, fishing, ethanol production,
steel production, retail, telecommunication and petrol sectors.

## International support

Malawi has undertaken economic structural adjustment programs supported by the
World Bank (IBRD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other donors
since 1981. Broad reform objectives include stimulation of private sector
activity and participation through the elimination of price controls and
industrial licensing, liberalization of trade and foreign exchange,
rationalization of taxes, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and civil
service reform. Malawi qualified for Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt
relief and is in the process of refining its poverty reduction strategy.

Malawi has bilateral trade agreements with its two major trading partners,
South Africa and Zimbabwe, both of which allow duty-free entry of Malawian
products into their countries. The government faces challenges such as the
improvement of Malawi's educational and health facilities — particularly
important because of the rising[_when?_] rates of HIV/AIDS — and environmental
problems including deforestation, erosion, and overworked soils.[_citation

Former President Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi spoke about the country's recent
unilateral agricultural reforms at the World Economic Forum on Africa at the
United Nations, September 2008.

### Move towards economic independence

In 2006, in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi,
through an initiative by the late President Bingu Mutharika, an economist by
profession, began a program of fertilizer subsidies that were designed to re-
energize the land and boost crop production. It has been reported that this
program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving
Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to
nearby countries.

Economic grievances though took a downward slide during Mutharika's second
term. Economic grievances were a catalyst that resulted in the 2011 economic
protests in Malawi in July.
