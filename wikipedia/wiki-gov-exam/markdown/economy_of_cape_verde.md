The **economy of Cape Verde** is a service-oriented economy that is focused on
commerce, trade, transport and public services. Cape Verde is a small
archipelagic nation that lacks resources and has experienced severe droughts.
Agriculture is made difficult by lack of rain and is restricted to only four
islands for most of the year. Cape Verde's economy has been steadily growing
since the late 1990s, and it is now officially considered a country of average
development, being only the second African country to have achieved such
transition, after Botswana in 1994. Cape Verde has significant cooperation
with Portugal at every level of the economy, which has led it to link its
currency (the Cape Verdean escudo) first to the Portuguese escudo and, in
1999, to the euro.

## Resources

About 75% of food is imported. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit,
financed by foreign aid and remittances from emigrants; remittances constitute
a supplement to GDP of more than 20%. Economic reforms, launched by the new
democratic government in 1991, are aimed at developing the private sector and
attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy. Since 1991, the
policies the government has pursued include an open welcome to foreign
investors and a far-reaching privatization program.

Fish and shellfish are plentiful, and small quantities are exported. Cape
Verde has cold storage and freezing facilities as well as fish processing
plants in Mindelo, Praia, and on Sal. However, the fishing potential, mostly
lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.

The economy is service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
accounting for almost 70% of the GDP. Although nearly 35% of the population
lives in rural areas, the share of agriculture in GDP in 2010 was only 9.2%
(up from 8.9% in 1995); of the 1998 total, fishing accounts for 1.5%.

The Cape Verdean government established the top priorities for development as
the promotion of a market economy and of the private sector; the development
of tourism, light manufacturing industries, and fisheries; and the development
of transport, communications, and energy facilities. In 1994-95 Cape Verde
received a total of about U.S.$50 million in foreign investments, of which 50%
was in industry, 19% in tourism, and 31% in fisheries and services. Prospects
for 2000 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the
momentum of the government's development program.

### Mineral industry

Mining is an insignificant contributor to the country's economy. Most of the
country's mineral requirements are imported. As of 2007, production of mineral
commodities was limited to clay on the islands of Boa Vista, Sal, and São
Vicente; gypsum and iron ore on the island of Maio; limestone on the islands
of Boa Vista, Sal, and Santo Antão; pozzolana on the island of Santo Antão;
and salt on the islands of Maio and Sal. Cape Verde was not a natural gas or
petroleum producer as of 2007.

## Transportation

Shipyard at Mindelo

Cape Verde's strategic location at the crossroads of mid-Atlantic air and sea
lanes has been enhanced by significant improvements at Mindelo's harbour
(Porto Grande) and at Sal's international airport. Ship repair facilities at
Mindelo were opened in 1983, and the harbours at Mindelo and Praia were
recently renovated. The major ports are Mindelo and Praia, but all other
islands have small port facilities, some of which are to be expanded in the
near future. In addition to the international airport on Sal, airports are
located on all of the inhabited islands except for the smallest island, Brava,
which was built, but found to be too dangerous so it was shut down after a few
failed attempted landings. The archipelago has 3,050 kilometers (1,830 mi.) of
roads, of which 1,010 kilometers (606 mi.) are paved. The new Praia
International Airport is currently operative.

## International recognition

Cape Verde is considered a developing country, and is included on the list of
the United Nations Small Island Developing States.

In 2007 the United Nations graduated Cape Verde from the category of Least
Developed Countries, only the second time this has happened to a country.

On December 18, 2007, the General Council of the World Trade Organization
approved a package for the accession of Cape Verde to the WTO. Accession was
effective on July 23, 2008, 30 days after ratification by Cape Verde, which
took place on 23 June. The package requires Cape Verde to adapt some of its
economic regulation. In particular, it will need to introduce a new Customs
Code, and to introduce copyright and patent laws complying with the Agreement
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. According to the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Cape Verde have a law on
copyrights (Law No. 101/III/90, December 1990) and an Industrial Property Code
(Legislative Decree No. 4/2007 of August 20, 2007). Pascal Lamy, director-
general of the WTO said, "I am very pleased to welcome Cape Verde as a new
member. This new membership will strengthen multilateral trading system. Being
part of the WTO will enable Cape Verde to continue its integration into the
world economy."
