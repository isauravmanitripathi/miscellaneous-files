Zambian exports in 2006

Zambia is a developing country, and it achieved middle-income status in 2011.
Through the first decade of the 21st century, the **economy of Zambia** was
one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and its capital, Lusaka, the
fastest-growing city in the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
Zambia's economic performance has stalled in recent years due to declining
copper prices, significant fiscal deficits, and energy shortages. The economy
has been reliant on mineral extraction since the 1920s, in particular copper.

Upon achieving independence, Zambia had a higher GDP per capita than almost
all sub-Saharan African countries. Over the subsequent decades, Zambia's
economy contracted, in part due to declining copper prices. Since the 2000s,
Zambia's economy has been growing. As of 2019, Zambia's GDP per capita
(current international dollars) stands at $1,305.00.

Zambia is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's most urbanized countries. About one-half
of the country's 16 million people are concentrated in a few urban zones
strung along the major transportation corridors, while rural areas are under-
populated.

Copper and cobalt are among Zambia's main exports, while non-traditional
exports include cotton, coffee, fresh flowers, burley tobacco, gemstones and
maize (corn). Zambia is eligible to export duty-free goods to the United
States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); the Act allows
eligible countries from sub-Saharan Africa to export over 6,400 goods to the
United States.

Copper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices
and the opening of new mines. The maize harvest was again good in 2005,
helping boost GDP and agricultural exports. Cooperation continues with
international bodies on programs to reduce poverty, including a new lending
arrangement with the IMF in the second quarter of 2004.

## History

### Economic policies soon after independence (1964–1967)

GDP per capita development of Zambia, since 1950

The British South Africa Company (BSAC, originally set up by the British
imperialist Cecil Rhodes) retained commercial assets and mineral rights that
it acquired from a concession signed with the Litunga of Barotseland in 1892
(the Lochner Concession). Only by threatening to expropriate the BSAC, on the
eve of independence, did the incoming Zambian government manage to get the
BSAC to relinquish the mineral rights. The Federation's government assigned
roles to each of the three territories: Southern Rhodesia was assigned the
responsibility of providing managerial and administrative skills; Northern
Rhodesia provided copper revenues; and Nyasaland provided the Black labour.

After independence, Zambia instituted a program of national development plans,
under the direction of a National Commission for Development Planning: the
Transitional Development Plan (1964–66) was followed by the First National
Development Plan (1966–71). These two plans, which provided for major
investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, were largely implemented and
were generally successful. This was not true for subsequent plans.

### The Mulungushi Economic Reforms (1968)

A major switch in the structure of Zambia's economy came with the Mulungushi
Reforms of April 1968: the government declared its intention to acquire equity
holdings (usually 51% or more) in a number of key foreign-owned firms, to be
controlled by a parastatal conglomerate named the Industrial Development
Corporation (INDECO). By January 1970, Zambia had acquired majority holding in
the Zambian operations of the two major foreign mining corporations, the Anglo
American Corporation and the Rhodesia Selection Trust (RST); the two became
the Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines (NCCM) and Roan Consolidated Mines
(RCM), respectively. The Zambian government then created a new parastatal
body, the Mining Development Corporation (MINDECO). The Finance and
Development Corporation (FINDECO) allowed the Zambian government to gain
control of insurance companies and building societies. However, foreign-owned
banks (such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays) successfully
resisted takeover. In 1971, INDECO, MINDECO, and FINDECO were brought together
under an omnibus parastatal, the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation
(ZIMCO), to create one of the largest companies in sub-Saharan Africa, with
the country's president, Kenneth Kaunda as chairman of the board. The
management contracts under which day-to-day operations of the mines had been
carried out by Anglo American and RST were ended in 1973. In 1982 NCCM and RCM
were merged into the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM).

In 1973 a massive increase in the price of oil was followed by a slump in
copper prices in 1975, resulting in a diminution of export earnings. In 1973
the price of copper accounted for 95% of all export earnings; this halved in
value on the world market in 1975. By 1976 Zambia had a balance-of-payments
crisis, and rapidly became massively indebted to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). The Third National Development Plan (1978–83) had to be abandoned
as crisis management replaced long-term planning.

By the mid-1980s Zambia was one of the most indebted nations in the world,
relative to its gross domestic product (GDP). The IMF was insisting that the
Zambian government should introduce programs aimed at stabilizing the economy
and restructuring it to reduce dependence on copper. The proposed measures
included: the ending of price controls; devaluation of the kwacha (Zambia's
currency); cut-backs in government expenditure; cancellation of subsidies on
food and fertilizer; and increased prices for farm produce. Kaunda's removal
of food subsidies caused massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs;
the country's urbanized population rioted in protest. In desperation, Kaunda
broke with the IMF in May 1987 and introduced a New Economic Recovery
Programme in 1988. However, this did not help him and he eventually moved
toward a new understanding with the IMF in 1989. In 1990 Kaunda was forced to
make a major policy volteface: he announced the intention to partially
privatize the parastatals. Time, however, was running out for him. Like many
African independence leaders Kaunda tried to hang on to power but unlike many
he called multiparty elections and lost them to the Movement for Multiparty
Democracy (MMD) and abided by the results. Kaunda left office with the
inauguration of MMD leader Frederick Chiluba as president on 2 November 1991.

### Chiluba's economic reforms (1991–2000)

Zambia's Economic System of Government is Unitary because of that the
Frederick Chiluba government (1991–2001), which came to power after democratic
multi-party elections in November 1991, was committed to extensive economic
reform.[_page needed_]

Zambia's economic transformation into a free market system began toward the
end of 1991 following a change of government. To tackle a serious economic
crisis, the government agreed to introduce substantial economic reforms to
secure much-needed loans from the World Bank and IMF.

One of the greatest challenges was the privatization of the country's copper
mines, Zambia's prime export earner. The government privatised many state
industries, and maintained positive real interest rates. Exchange controls
were eliminated and free market principles endorsed. It remains to be seen
whether the Mwanawasa government will follow a similar path of implementing
economic reform and undertaking further privatization. Zambia has yet to
address issues such as reducing the size of the public sector, which still
represents 44% of total formal employment, and improving Zambia's social
sector delivery systems.

After the government privatized the giant parastatal mining company Zambian
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), donors resumed balance-of-payment support.
The final transfer of ZCCM's assets occurred on March 31, 2000. Although
balance-of-payment payments are not the answer to Zambia's long-term debt
problems, it will in the short term provide the government some breathing room
to implement further economic reforms. The government has, however, spent much
of its foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the exchange rate mechanism.
To continue to do so, however, would jeopardize Zambia's debt relief. Zambia
qualified for HIPC debt relief in 2000, contingent upon the country meeting
certain performance criteria, and this should offer a long-term solution to
Zambia's debt situation.

### 2001–2010

On 2 January 2002, MMD's Levy Mwanawasa won the presidential election which
many observers claimed had actually been won by the opposition. In January
2003, the Zambian Government informed the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance
criteria calling for privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and
the national telephone and electricity utilities.

Foreign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his anti-corruption drive.
During his presidency, Zambia received foreign investment. The main driver of
economic growth was minerals. Mwanawasa's policies helped to lower inflation
to single digits in 2006, a record the country had not seen in over 25 years,
and spread some benefits to the poor. Tourists and white farmers diverted from
Zimbabwe and helped the Zambian economy. The policies turned the Zambian town
of Livingstone, near Victoria Falls, into a tourist hub. Zambia received a
relatively large amount of aid and debt relief because of liberalisation and
Mwanawasa's efforts. Overall, economic growth increased to about 6% per year.

After Mwanawasa suffered a stroke while attending an African Union summit in
Egypt on 29 June 2008, Rupiah Banda became acting president and subsequently
President. With divisions within the MMD, Banda promised to "unite the party
and the entire nation" and to "continue implementing [Mwanawasa's] programs".
After taking office, however, Banda dismantled much of the anti-corruption
effort put into place by his predecessor, Mwanawasa. This, compounded with the
effects of the Great Recession, led to a sustained period of increased
inflation.

### 2011–2020

In September 2011, the social democrat, Michael Sata led the Patriotic Front
(PF) to victory with a vow to improve conditions for their Zambian employees.
Though known to previously oppose Chinese investment, he declared his change
in perspective prior to his election victory. Sata died on 28 October 2014 and
was succeeded by Edgar Lungu. The period, saw an infrastructure boom with the
development of the Kafue Gorge Lower Power Station, two multi-purpose
stadiums, Levy Mwanawasa Stadium and National Heroes Stadium, expansions of
the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, the Harry Mwanga Nkumbula
International Airport and the Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport, and
the Pave Zambia 2000 project intended to create and repair major urban roads
countrywide.

Unfortunately this came at a huge debt cost that slowed the economy and
compounded by corruption and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in weak GDP growth
and a recession in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Zambia's GDP had shrunk from
US$29 billion to US$19 billion and its debt grew from 16% to 140% of GDP from
2010 through 2020. In November 2020, Zambia became Africa's first coronavirus-
era default when it opted to bow out of a US$42.5 million eurobond repayment.

### From 2021

In August 2021, the Zambian populace ushered in a new government with a
promise for jobs growth. Hakainde Hichilema's United Party for National
Development (UPND) government delivered an ambitious budget that included an
increase in the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) from ZMW 1.6 million
(US$91 thousand) to ZMW 25.7 million (US$1.5 million) for each of Zambia's 156
constituencies and its decentralization in release to these constituencies.
The expectation is that this will generate jobs growth in addition to the
government's targeted employment of 30,000 new teachers and 11,200 health
workers. In mid July 2022, the government recruited 30,496 Teachers. At the
end of July 2022, 11,276 health workers, being doctors, nurses and ancillary
staff such as drivers were recruited by the government.

With a push for Zambia to be able to produce 3 million tonnes of Copper per
annum within the next 10 years, the government reintroduced the deductibility
of mineral royalty for corporate income tax assessment purposes. The results
of these policy changes are yet to be seen.

At the 2022 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings, the World Bank announced it would
fund projects worth US$560 million in Zambia in 2022.

In July 2022, to address its debt challenges, the Zambian government engaged
creditors of undisbursed loans to facilitate the formal cancellation of loans
estimated to be about US$2.0 billion. Projects that were already ongoing would
now be financed through government revenues.

In early August 2022, the Zambia Development Agency, a quasi-government
institution under the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry reported that
it had recorded numerous investment pledges worth US$3.8 billion in the first
half to 2022 targeting the agriculture, tourism, construction and mining
sectors with a potential job market of 19,000.

In October 2021, to spur economic development, Zambia took measures to promote
local development in its ambitious 2022 national budget. The Government
announced an unprecedented constituency development fund (CDF) increment from
ZMW 1.6 million (U$91,000) to ZMW 25.7 million (U$1.5million) for each
constituency taking the total development fund injection into the local
communities from ZMW 250 million (U$14.2 million) to ZMW 4 billion (U$228.4
million). After winning a crucial Staff-Level IMF Deal, in early December
2021, Zambia went on to cut fuel subsidies later that month as a key step in
seeking U$1.4 billion from the IMF.

At the end of July 2022, the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by China
and France, and vice chaired by South Africa agreed to provide the financing
assurances under the G20 Common Framework for debt treatment that Zambia had
been waiting for to secure final approval from the International Monetary Fund
for a US$1.4 billion bailout under the Extended Credit Facility. In early
August 2022, at the symposium on the midyear budget and economic performance
and the 2023 to 2025 medium term budget plan, Zambia's Minister of Finance and
National Planning, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane said the IMF board was expected
to meet at the end of August 2022 to approve the loan programme.

On 31 August 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board approved a
US$1.3 billion extended credit facility to help Zambia restore fiscal
stability.

In June 2023, Zambia reached an agreement in principle to restructure US$6.3
billion of debt with bilateral lenders. In October 2023, Zambia agreed a
memorandum of understanding (MoU) with its bilateral creditors on
restructuring about $6.3 billion of debt. Following the signing of the MoU,
the terms would be implemented through bilateral agreements with each member
of the OCC (Official Creditor Committee).

In March 2024, Zambia struck an 76.5 billion kwacha (US$3.0 billion)
restructuring deal with bondholders. The agreement included important
concessions from the Bondholders, while providing the required debt relief to
the Government. Under the agreement, Bondholders would forego approximately
21.4 billion kwacha (US$840 million) of their claims, and provide cash flow
relief of approximately 63.8 billion kwacha (US$2.5 billion) during the IMF
programme period.

#### Public-Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF)

In April 2022, Zambia launched a mechanism aimed at unlocking the potential of
the private sector as a driver of economic development and job creation. The
Public-Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF) is meant to act as a structured mechanism
for interactions between the public and the private sector in tackling
bottlenecks that have hindered the growth of the private sector.

#### European Union (EU)–Zambia Economic Forum

In May 2022, the inaugural European Union (EU)-Zambia Economic Forum was
launched in Lusaka by President Hakainde Hichilema under the theme ‘Economic
transformation through green growth’. It was a high-level event that brought
together entrepreneurs, experts, financial institutions, innovators, and
policy decision-makers from Zambia, the EU and representatives of its 27
member states. Additional special guests included the EU Commissioner for
Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski and the commissioner for Trade and Industry
of the African Union Commission, Albert M. Muchanga. The forum was launched as
a platform with a view to promoting employment, value addition and increased
trade through business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G)
collaboration and economic synergies for EU and Zambian businesses.

#### UK–Zambia Green Growth Compact

In November 2021, the Zambian and British government signed the UK-Zambia
Green Growth Compact, an agreement expected to boost the United Kingdom's
investment into Zambia by **£** 1.0 billion (US$1.26 billion) with a focus on
job creation and green energy production. In May 2022, the British High
Commissioner to Zambia Nicholas Woolley, indicated that the British government
had set aside the **£** 1.0 billion to be spent over the next 5 years with
**£** 100.0 million (US$126.0 million) targeted for funding Small Medium
Entrepreneurs (SMEs) and **£ 5**00.0 million (US$629.9 million) for investment
in renewable energy.

#### World Bank Support

In July 2022, the World Bank approved US$155.0 million in International
Development Assistance for Social Cash Transfer to mitigate the high cost of
living pressures in Zambia and a further US$27.0 million credit facility to
support the government's development programs.

In July 2022, the World Bank approved a further US$665.0 million to fund
projects in Zambia to spur economic recovery and growth and also lighten the
debt burden. Through 2032, the World Bank plans to support Zambia with new
financing of over US$2.0 billion in the form of concessional loans.

In late October 2022, the World Bank approved US$275.0 million concessional
loan targeted at fiscal stabilization and accelerated economic programs.
Financing was provided by the World Bank's International Development
Association (IDA).

#### African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) Support

In July 2022, the African Export-Import Bank President Benedict Oramah, whilst
in Lusaka Zambia, announced that the bank would put up an investment of about
US$250 million for Zambia's first-ever Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
manufacturing plant.

#### EAC-SADC-COMESA Free Trade Area

In July 2022, during the 4th Mid-Year Coordination Meeting of the African
Union, Regional Economic Communities and Regional Mechanisms in Lusaka,
Zambia, the three regional blocs, East African Community (EAC), Southern
African Development Community (SADC), and Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) agreed to have a tripartite ministers' summit to fast
track the finalization of the border control-free travel and free movement of
goods and services area by the end of 2022.

#### Zambia-China Trade and Investment Forum

In September 2022, Zambia and China launched the inaugural trade and
investment forum aimed at unlocking trade and investment potential between the
two countries. The event also saw the signing of an Exchange Letter of the
Duty Free Treatment for Zambian products corresponding to 98-percent of the
tariff lines by Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane and Chinese Ambassador
to Zambia Du Xiao.

#### Zambia-China bilateral trade growth

In mid-September 2023, President Hakainde Hichilema met with The President of
The Peoples Republic of China, Xi Jinping in Beijing where they witnessed the
signing of over 15 MOUs amounting to a potential investment of about ZMW 62.3
billion kwacha (US$3.0 billion) by China into Zambia and the leaders also
agreed to increase the use of local currencies in trade between the two
countries. One of the MOUs signed during Mr. Hichilema's visit to China was
with the international telecoms manufacturer ZTE to construct and open a
smartphone manufacturing plant in Zambia. In late-September 2023, China
Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) unveiled plans to inject an additional
ZMW 27.0 billion kwacha (US $1.3 billion) into Zambia from 2023 through 2028,
spanning the mining, energy, education and technology economic sectors.

#### U.S.-Zambia Business Summit

In October 2022, more than 50 United States and Zambian business and
government leaders gathered in Lusaka for the two-day inaugural U.S.-Zambia
Business Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel. Representatives from the U.S.
Trade and Development Agency, U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation also attended the Summit. The Summit focused on promoting Zambia
as one of the most attractive business environments for investment on the
African continent.

**African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Digital Trade Forum**

In May 2025, Zambia hosted the inaugural, African Continental Free Trade Area
(AfCFTA) Digital Trade Forum in Lusaka. The Digital Trade Forum, bringing
together policymakers and business leaders from across Africa, aimed to
develop practical strategies for implementing the AfCFTA’s digital commerce
provisions.

## Sectors

### Mining

In 2019, the country was the world's 7th largest producer of copper.

The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper-mining industry.
The industrialization of the copper industry is owed partly to Frederick
Russell Burnham, the famous American scout who worked for Cecil Rhodes. By
1998, however, output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 tonnes,
continuing a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, and until
recently, low copper prices and uncertainty over privatization. In 2001, the
first full year of a privatized industry, Zambia recorded its first year of
increased productivity since 1973. The future of the copper industry in Zambia
was thrown into doubt in January 2002, when investors in Zambia's largest
copper mine announced their intention to withdraw their investment. However,
surging copper prices from 2004 to the present day rapidly rekindled
international interest in Zambia's copper sector with a new buyer found for
KCCM and massive investments in expanding capacity launched. China has become
a major investor in the Zambian copper industry, and in February 2007, the two
countries announced the creation of a Chinese-Zambian economic partnership
zone around the Chambishi copper mine.

Today copper mining is central to the economic prospects for Zambia and covers
85% of all the country's exports, but concerns remain that the economy is not
diversified enough to cope with a collapse in international copper prices.

In January 2013, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) approved 27
mining and exploration licences, with more rumoured to be confirmed.

Zambia is the world's second biggest producer of emeralds, with its Kafubu
River area deposits (Kagem Mines) about 45 km (28 mi) southwest of Kitwe
responsible for 20% of the world's production of gem-quality stones in 2004.
In the first half of 2011, the Kagem Mines produced 3.74 tons of emeralds. In
April 2022, Gemfields, the majority owner in the mine, recorded a record
U$42.3 million at a sold out March/April auction and since 2009, Kagem-sourced
gemstones (emerald and beryl) have netted Gemfields revenue totaling U$792
million with the proceeds fully repatriated to Kagem in Zambia, with all
royalties due to the Zambian government paid on the full sales prices achieved
at auctions.

Rich deposits of Uranium have been discovered in some parts of Zambia. In
2007, the Zambian government sought scrutiny and guidance from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its developed guidelines to
regulate the mining of uranium in the country. In 2008, deposits were found in
Kaputa District, Northern Province. Albidon Zambia Limited also confirmed the
presence of high-grade uranium mineralisation at its Njame east project near
Chirundu. In the Southern Province, 31 km North of Siavonga, and north of Lake
Kariba, there are 5 main Uranium Deposits: Mutanga, Dibwe, Dibwe East, Njame,
and Gwabe explored under The Mutanga Uranium Project. The Canadian Toronto
Stock Exchange (TSX) listed GoviEx Uranium Inc acquired 100% of the Mutanga
Project also known as the Kariba Uranium Project in 2016. In March 2022,
GoviEx announced that the Project is forecast to start production in 2027 and
could be the lowest capital intensive uranium project in Africa.

Lumwana Mining Company Limited (LMC) who had embarked on uranium exploration
in 2007 in Solwezi District are currently stock piling uranium that the firm
is getting as a by-product of Copper from its operations as they are yet to
obtain a uranium license. The mining of uranium in Zambia is monitored by the
Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA).

### Agriculture

The agriculture sector represented 2.7% GDP in 2019. Agriculture accounted for
85% of total employment (formal and informal) for 2000. Maize (corn) is the
principal cash crop as well as the staple food. Other important crops include
soybean, cotton, sugar, sunflower seeds, wheat, sorghum, pearl millet,
cassava, tobacco and various vegetable and fruit crops. Floriculture is a
growth sector, and agricultural non-traditional exports now rival the mining
industry in foreign exchange receipts. Zambia has the potential for
significantly increasing its agricultural output; currently, less than 20% of
its arable land is cultivated. In the past, the agriculture sector suffered
from low producer prices, difficulties in availability and distribution of
credit and inputs, and the shortage of foreign exchange.

  * 4.7 million tons of sugarcane;
  * 4 million tons of cassava (18th largest producer in the world);
  * 2 million tons of maize;
  * 281 thousand tons of soy;
  * 153 thousand tons of tobacco (6th largest producer in the world);

  * 109 thousand tons of sweet potato;
  * 72 thousand tons of cotton;
  * 6,900 tons of coffee;

In addition to other productions of other agricultural products.

Due to high demand for flour in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo
DRC, Zambia increased Wheat production from 205,000 tonnes in 2020 to 400,000
tonnes 2021.

In July 2022, Zambia and China sealed a memorandum of understanding on soya
bean meal and stevia export from Zambia to China.

In 2019, Zambia generated a total of 15,013GWh of Energy. 12,427GWh was
Renewable and 2,586 GWh was non-renewable. Over 99% of the Renewable energy
component was Hydro electricity.

With a view to diversifying the power generation profile, Zambia increased its
Solar Power generation Capacity in 2019.

In March 2019, the 54MW Bangweulu Solar Power Station was commissioned.

In May 2019, the 34MW Ngonye Solar Power Station was commissioned.

In July 2022, the local National utility ZESCO, announced it had achieved an
electricity generation surplus of about 1,156 MW. Zambia's national generation
capacity stands at 3,456.8 MW versus a peak national demand of 2,300 MW. The
surplus power is to be directed to service the power supply agreements for the
export of 180 MW to Namibia and 100 MW to Zimbabwe. The exportation of 100MW
electricity to Zimbabwe which is set to commence in August 2022 is under a
five-year contract with a condition precedent that ZESCO earns monthly income
of US$6.3 million prior exporting to Zimbabwe.

The close of 2022 brought in some serious challenges to the Zambian economy,
when low water levels at the Kariba Dam significantly impacted the 1080MW
Kariba Hydro Power plant's output capacity and resulted in load shedding for
businesses and residents across the country. This was compounded by the
maintenance that was being carried out at the 300MW Maamba Coilleries Coal
Fired Power Plant.

In January 2023, Zambia signed a US$2 billion dollar MOU and Joint Development
Agreement (JDA) with the United Arab Emirates for the development of 2000MW of
Solar Power Projects.

In April 2023, Zambia, through its state owned utility company ZESCO Limited,
signed a ZMW 67 Billion (US$3.4 Billion) Power Purchase Agreement with
Integrated Clean Energy Power Company of China to produce 2,400 Mega Watts of
renewable energy. Implementation of the project is expected to be done in a
phased manner with the first phase producing 600MW of solar energy distributed
as one 300MW power plant in Central Province and another 300MW Power plant in
Southern Province. The two 300MW solar power plants of phase one are expected
to be connected to the National Grid by the end of 2024.

#### Petroleum

Zambia is a net importer of petroleum and in 2019, Oil & Mineral Fuels ranked
top amongst the country's trade imports at a value of U$1.26 billion.

In January 2022, the ERB migrated from a Quarterly pricing cycle to a monthly
pricing cycle to enable the local price of fuel to be more responsive to the
market fundamentals namely: international oil prices and the Kwacha/US Dollar
exchange rate prevailing in the month preceding the pricing decision. Further,
following the UPND governments' policy decision to place INDENI Petroleum
Refinery on care and maintenance, the nation moved to one type of Diesel sold
on the market, and that is the imported Low Sulphur Gasoil/Diesel.

In January 2023, Zambia announced plans to acquire a stake in its neighbor
Angola's Lobito Oil Refinery located in Benguela Province along the Atlantic
Coast. The Lobito refinery, that is set to be completed in 2026, will have the
capacity to produce 200,000 barrels per day. Under the current proposal,
private investors, including Zambia, will own 70% shares in the refinery,
while Angola's state oil firm, Sonangol Group, will hold 30% ownership.

In September 2023, TAZAMA began constructing a 3 km pipeline to tie the Tazama
Pipeline to the 6.5 million litre Mpika fuel storage depot at a cost of ZMW
31.26 million kwacha (US$1.5 million). When commissioned the pipeline is
planned to divert a portion of the low sulfur diesel imported via the pipeline
to the storage depot to service the Northern circuit of Zambia with long term
benefits of lower fuel costs in the region. This tie-in pipeline is the first
of a planned network of distribution pipelines to the other fuel storage
depots in Zambia.

### Tourism

Zambia's tourism revenue has been generally raised from local and
international tourists visiting the Victoria Falls in Livingstone, and its
associated attractions such as the Livingstone Museum and the Mosi-oa-Tunya
National Park. In July 2020, the Livingstone Tourism Association reported that
during the Heroes and Unity holidays the holiday site received a record number
of visitors. Celebrities such as Will Smith and some Entrepreneur[_who?_] have
visited the tourist site with the latter celebrating her £3 million nuptials
in a picturesque ceremony at The Royal Livingstone Hotel by the banks of the
Zambezi River.

To advance home grown tourism, in March 2021, African Eagle Hotels, a multi-
national company, stated that a 2 Star and 5 Star Hotel each costing U$20
million and U$30 million would be constructed and opened at the Kasaba Bay
Resort located in the Nsumbu National Park and open by 2023. In October 2021,
through its national budget, the government also allocated ZMW 150 million
(U$8.6 million) to further the development of Kasaba Bay, to spur tourism in
the Northern Circuit of Zambia.

## Growth

There are, however, positive macroeconomic signs, rooted in reforms
implemented in the early and mid-1990s. Zambia's floating exchange rate and
open capital markets have provided useful discipline on the government, while
at the same time allowing continued diversification of Zambia's export sector,
growth in the tourist industry, and procurement of inputs for growing
businesses. Some parts of the Copper Belt have experienced a significant
revival as spin-off effects from the massive capital reinvestment are
experienced.

### Export Diversification

As Zambia continued on its path to diversifying from dependence on Copper with
an emphasis on growth in agriculture, in April 2022, the country's Ministry of
Agriculture through the Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS)
approved the first consignment of over 37 metric tons of Zambian grown
avocados for export to countries in the European Union.

### The Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZ)

In 2005, the Japanese Government through Japan International Corporation
Agency (JICA) aided the Zambia government to introduce the Multi- Facility
Economic Zone (MFEZ) programme. The aim is to create a platform for Zambia to
achieve economic development by attracting significant domestic and foreign
direct investment (FDI) through a strengthened policy and legislative
environment. The MFEZs are, special industrial zones for both export-oriented
and domestic-oriented industries. The zones are expected to have well
appointed infrastructure in place in order to attract and facilitate
establishment of world-class enterprises in the zone (s).

Among the MFEZ investment incentives offered for companies operating under the
MFEZ/Priority Sector include:

MFEZ Incentives  Category  | Tax Rate  | Duration  | Conditions   
---|---|---|---  
Corporate Tax | 0%  | 5 years  | from the year of first declaration of dividends   
Tax on Profits  | 30%  | 5 years  | from 6 to 8 years only 50% of the profits to be taxed for years 9 and 10, 75% of profits to be taxed   
Import Duty  | 0%  | 5 years  | on raw materials, capital goods, machinery including trucks and specialised motor vehicles   
Value Added Tax  | Deferred  | \-  | on machinery and equipment including trucks and specialised motor vehicles imported   
  
Currently there are numerous MFEZs in Zambia:

#### The Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone (LS-MFEZ)

Established in June 2012, the zone prioritizes agribusiness, packaging and
printing, palm oil processing, pulp and packaging boards, pharmaceuticals,
electrical and electronic appliances, ICTs, education and skills training,
R&D, professional, medical, scientific and measuring services.

In 2020, the LS-MFEZ realised US$100.6 million worth of investments bringing
the accumulated investments to about US$567.6 million and generating about
7,100 jobs since commencing operations in 2012.

In 2021, the LS-MFEZ realised a record US$309.4 million worth of investments
bringing the accumulated investments to about US$877.4 million with permanent
jobs at about 9,360 and total jobs including construction workers at 11,560.

#### The Lusaka East Multi-Facility Economic Zone

This zone is also known as the Zambia-China Economic & Trade Cooperation Zone
(ZCCZ).

The zone prioritizes agriculture (circular and tourism agricultures), agro-
processing, brewery, pharmaceuticals, building materials, logistics (storage)
and international commerce.

#### Roma Industrial and Commercial Park

Launched in 2011, is expected to generate more than 4,000 permanent jobs once
fully developed and is focused on real estate and residential developments.

#### Chambishi Multi-Facility Economic Zone (CMFEZ)

Opened in 2007, prioritizes mining, engineering equipment assembly,
construction materials, fertilizers, agriculture, and service sectors such as
banking and hospitals.

By 2016, the CMFEZ had already received investment of about US$800 million
from 14 enterprises.

#### Chembe Multi-Facility Economic Zone

In 2016, the government launched the development of the Chembe Multi-Facility
Economic Zone in Chembe, Luapula Province.

#### Chibombo Multi-Facility Economic Zone

Located in Chibombo District, Central Province, Zambia, the ground breaking
for this zone was held in November 2018 and is also known as the Jiangxi
Multi-Facility Economic Zone.

In October 2021, the Chibombo MFEZ signed six project agreements worth US$160
million projected to create over 1,000 jobs.

#### Lumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone

In November 2009, the government of Zambia announced a plan for a US$1.2
billion investment into the declared Lumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone.

#### Sub-Saharan Gemstones Exchange Industrial Park

This Multi-Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ) is located in Ndola, Copperbelt
Province.

By October 2011, over US$10 million had been invested in the infrastructure in
the MFEZ.

#### Kalumbila Multi-Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ)

### Fintech

Zambia has a relatively quiet startup and venture capital space; however, the
trend seems to be shifting as in August 2021 fintech company Union54 led the
way by being the first Zambian startup accepted into Y Combinator's summer
batch of YC 2021. In October 2021, American investment firm Tiger Global led a
U$3 million seed round in Union54. And in April 2022, the Zambian company
raised an additional U$12 million in a seed extension round also led by Tiger
Global.

### Salaula

Standard economic theory and empirical data indicates that second-hand
clothing import can have positive effects in a country like Zambia (one of the
least developed countries in the world). The _salaula_ market reduces the
proportion of income that a family has to spend on clothing. It also helps to
keep employments like repairs and alterations in business and forces tailors
to proceed into more specialize production of styled garments.

There is a downside to such imports, however; the massive importation of used
clothing from the developed world has resulted in a near-total collapse of the
Zambian indigenous textile industry. In the face of cheap used clothing,
tailors' specialized production may be irrelevant - customers will buy the
least expensive clothing available, irrespective of style. Those who might
otherwise work at textile mills or clothing factories are left jobless, or
else make significantly less money in the salaula resale business.

### Electric Battery Value Chain

Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), two countries, that have
more than 70% of the world's Cobalt reserves and an abundance of Copper,
Nickel and Manganese have resolved to set up a Zambia-DRC-Executive Battery
Council to oversee the implementation of the cooperating agreement for the
electric vehicle battery value chain. The Executive Council's executive
committee will be composed of President Hakainde Hichilema, his DRC
counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the Deputy Secretary General of the African
Economic Community for the United Nations, as well as the President of AFREXIM
Bank, as a financial partner. Also issued was a communiqué by the two heads of
state that indicated that the two countries will also harmonize policies for
the initiative. Zambia and the DRC signed the MOU in Lusaka Zambia on 29 April
2022.

In July 2022, the African Export-Import Bank President Benedict Oramah, whilst
in Lusaka Zambia, announced that a pool of investors had earmarked more than
US$500.0 million to set up an industrial park for the purposes of adding value
to the copper, cobalt, and manganese mined in Zambia. The investors will set
up plants to process cobalt, copper, and lithium that are in Zambia and
neighboring countries and establish a US$250 million Battery Electric Vehicle
(BEV) manufacturing plant.

In July 2022, at the 94th Agricultural and Commercial Show in Lusaka, the
managing director of the National Utility ZESCO, Victor Mapani announced that
the company plans to deploy Electric Vehicle EV charging stations across the
country in an effort to accelerate and promote the transition to EVs and
enhance carbon emission reduction.

In December 2022, on the sidelines of the ongoing US-Africa summit in
Washington DC, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the
United States of America signed an MOU toward the actualization of the
electric vehicle battery value chain. Different US institutions and agencies
such as USAID, the US Department of Commerce, the Trade and Development
Agency, are exploring technical assistance for the Zambia-DRC EV supply chain.
Additionally, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Development
Finance Corporation, will be exploring financing and support mechanisms for
investment in African electric vehicle value chains.

In April 2023, The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) signed a framework agreement with
Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo for the establishment of special
economic zones for the production of electric vehicles and batteries.
Afreximbank and ECA will lead the establishment of an operating company in
consortium with public and private investors and Afreximbank's impact fund
subsidiary, the Fund for Export Development in Africa. The new company will
develop special economic zones (SEZs) dedicated to the production of battery
precursors, batteries, and electric vehicles, in both nations.

In October 2023, the Chinese company Better Technology Group announced that
procurement of electric vehicle battery, energy storage battery and
Uninterruptiple Supply battery manufacturing equipment was under underway and
will be delivered in Zambia by December 2023. This equipment will be part of
the EV battery manufacturing facility to be set up in Zambia's Chibomba-
Jiangxi Multi Facility Economic Zone in Central Province with construction set
to be completed by March 2024. The Group President also announced that the
company has budgeted to invest ZMW 2.18 billion kwacha (US$100 million) in the
Venture through 2026.

### Telecommunications

In June 2023, an internet services license was granted to Starlink by the
Zambian Government through the Electronic Government Division – SMART Zambia,
following the completion of trial projects throughout the nation.

## Inflation

GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average =
100)

Lack of balance-of-payment support meant the Zambian government did not have
resources for capital investment and periodically had to issue bonds or
otherwise expand the money supply to try to meet its spending and debt
obligations. The government continued these activities even after balance-of-
payment support resumed. This has kept interest rates at levels that are too
high for local business, fuelled inflation, burdened the budget with domestic
debt payments, while still falling short of meeting the public payroll and
other needs, such as infrastructure rehabilitation. The government was forced
to draw down foreign exchange reserves sharply in 1998 to meet foreign debt
obligations, putting further pressure on the kwacha and inflation. Inflation
held at 32% in 2000; consequently, the kwacha lost the same value against the
dollar over the same period. In mid- to late 2001, Zambia's fiscal management
became more conservative. As a result, 2001 year-end inflation was below 20%,
its best result in decades. In 2002 inflation rose to 26.7%. However, in 2007
inflation hit 8%, the first time in 30 years that Zambia had seen single digit
inflation.

On January 27, 2011, it was reported by the Central Statistical Office that
inflation rose to 9%. in 2012

Between April 2019 and April 2020 Zambia' s Annual inflation rate rose to
15.7% from 14% in March 2020. The rise of prices in food and other non- food
items led to the increase in the Annual inflation rate.

However, it is significant that inflation often peaks in election years,
hitting a recent high of 17.9% in 2016. This suggests that a further peak is
likely approaching during the 2021 general elections. The value of the kwacha
against the dollar has been relatively consistent for the past two years and
has yet to return to the recent high of almost 0.2 kwacha to the dollar in
2013. Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate of the kwacha against a
weighted average of foreign currencies improved from 88.5 in 2016 to 96.4 in
2017. The kwacha lost value against the dollar in September 2018 but has
remained fairly consistent at 0.08 to the dollar in November to December,
though further instability remains likely due to both political and economic
uncertainty.

## Public Private Partnerships (PPP)

In December 2021, Zambia's UPND Government set up the Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) Council of Ministers composed of the Minister of Finance and
National Planning (Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane) as the Chairperson and the
Ministers of Infrastructure (Charles Milupi), Commerce, Trade, and Industry
(Chipoka Mulenga), Transport and Logistics (Frank Tayali), and Technology and
Science (Felix Mutati). The focus of the council is to have public-private
partnerships become the primary avenue for infrastructure development as
opposed to the solely government funded path.
