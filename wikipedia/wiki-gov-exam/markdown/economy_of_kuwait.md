Kuwait has a petroleum-based economy that is classified as emerging and high-
income. By various per-capita measures of economic output, Kuwait is one of
the wealthiest countries in the world.

## Energy

### Petroleum and natural gas

In 1934, the Emir of Kuwait granted an oil concession to the Kuwait Oil Co.
(KOC), jointly owned by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later British Petroleum
Company) and Gulf Oil Corporation In 1976, the Kuwaiti Government nationalized
KOC.

Gulf war

The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), an integrated international oil
company, is the parent company of the government's operations in the petroleum
sector, and includes Kuwait Oil Company, which produced oil and gas; Kuwait
National Petroleum Co., refining and domestic sales; Petrochemical Industries
Co., producing ammonia and urea; Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co.,
with several concessions in developing countries; Kuwait Oil Tanker Co.; and
Santa Fe International Corp. The latter, purchased outright in 1982, gives KPC
a worldwide presence in the petroleum industry.

KPC also has purchased from Gulf Oil Co. refineries and associated service
stations in the Benelux nations and Scandinavia, as well as storage facilities
and a network of service stations in Italy. In 1987, KPC bought a 19% share in
British Petroleum, which was later reduced to 10%. KPC markets its products in
Europe under the brand Q8 and is interested in the markets of the United
States and Japan.

Kuwait has about 94 billion barrels (14.9 km3) of recoverable oil reserves.
Estimated capacity, before the war, was about 2.4 million barrels per day
(380×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d). During the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait's oil-producing
capacity was reduced to practically nothing. However, tremendous recovery and
improvements have been made since. Oil production was 1.5 million barrels per
day (240×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d) by the end of 1992, and pre-war capacity was restored
in 1993. Kuwait's production capacity is estimated to be 2.5 million barrels
per day (400×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d). Kuwait plans to increase its capacity to 3.5
million barrels per day (560×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d) by 2005..

As part of Kuwait Vision 2035, Kuwait aims to position itself as a global hub
for the petrochemical industry. Al Zour Refinery is the largest refinery in
the Middle East. Al Zour Refinery is a Kuwait-China cooperation project under
the Belt and Road Initiative.

### Renewable energy

As part of Kuwait Vision 2035, Kuwait inaugurated its largest renewable energy
park, Shagaya Renewable Energy Park, which includes concentrated solar power,
solar photovoltaic, and wind power plants. The park consists of four phases
with a target capacity of 4,000 MW. It is set to be one of the largest
renewable energy parks in the world.

## Steel manufacturing

Steel manufacturing is Kuwait's second biggest industry. United Steel
Industrial Company (KWT Steel) is Kuwait's main steel manufacturing company,
the company caters to all of Kuwait's domestic market demands (particularly
construction). Kuwait is self-sufficient in steel.

## Agriculture

In 2016, Kuwait's food self-sufficiency ratio was 49.5% in vegetables, 38.7%
in meat, 12.4% in dairy, 24.9% in fruits, and 0.4% in cereals. 8.5% of
Kuwait's entire territory consists of agricultural land, while arable land
covers 0.6% of Kuwait's entire territory. Historically, Jahra was a
predominantly agricultural area. There are currently various farms in Jahra.

In 2017, agriculture (including fisheries) accounted for almost 0.4 percent of
the gross domestic product. Around 4 percent of the economically active
population works in agriculture, almost all foreigners. The majority of farm
owners are investors. The total agricultural land covered 1,521 km2 in 2014.

The agriculture industry is hampered by the limited water and arable land. The
government has experimented in growing food through hydroponics and carefully
managed farms. However, most of the soil which was suitable for farming in
south central Kuwait was destroyed when Iraqi troops set fire to oil wells in
the area and created vast "oil lakes". Fish and shrimp are plentiful in
territorial waters, and largescale commercial fishing has been undertaken
locally and in the Indian Ocean.

## Finance

Kuwait has a leading position in the financial industry in the GCC. The Emir
has promoted the idea that Kuwait should focus its energies, in terms of
economic development, on the financial industry.

The historical preeminence of Kuwait (among the Gulf monarchies) in finance
dates back to the founding of the National Bank of Kuwait in 1952. The bank
was the first local publicly traded corporation in the Gulf. In the late 1970s
and early 1980s, an alternative stock market, trading in shares of Gulf
companies, emerged in Kuwait, the Souk Al-Manakh. At its peak, its market
capitalization was the third highest in the world, behind only the U.S. and
Japan, and ahead of the UK and France.

Kuwait has a large wealth-management industry. Kuwaiti investment companies
administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much
larger Saudi Arabia. The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation,
estimated that Kuwaiti firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets
under management in the GCC.

The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock
market. For many years, the total valuation of all companies listed on the
Kuwaiti exchange far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse,
except Saudi Arabia. In 2011, financial and banking companies made up more
than half of the market capitalization of the Kuwaiti bourse; among all the
Gulf states, the market capitalization of Kuwaiti financial-sector firms was,
in total, behind only that of Saudi Arabia. In recent years, Kuwaiti
investment companies have invested large percentages of their assets abroad,
and their foreign assets have become substantially larger than their domestic
assets.

Kuwait is a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states
through the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, an autonomous state
institution created in 1961 on the pattern of Western and international
development agencies. Over the years aid was annually provided to Egypt,
Syria, and Jordan, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1974,
the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all developing countries in
the world.

### Reserve funds

The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) is Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund
specializing in foreign investment. The KIA is the world's oldest sovereign
wealth fund. Since 1953, the Kuwaiti government has directed investments into
Europe, the United States and the Asia–Pacific. In 2021, the holdings were
valued at around $700 billion in assets. It was the 3rd largest sovereign
wealth fund in the world.

The KIA manages two funds: the General Reserve Fund (GRF) and Future
Generations Fund (FGF). The GRF is the main treasurer for the government. It
receives all state revenues and all national expenditures are paid out of this
fund. The KIA does not disclose its financial assets in public, but it is
estimated that the KIA has $410 billion in assets as of February 2014.

The KIA was the main source of capital for the Kuwaiti government during the
Gulf War. The Kuwaiti government relied on the KIA to pay for coalition
expenses and postwar reconstruction. The KIA was worth $100 billion prior to
1990, KIA funds were depleted to $40–$50 billion after the Gulf War.

In July 2023, Kuwait plans to create a new sovereign fund, Ciyada, in
partnership with the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA). While the value of the
fund has not been specified, the KIA, which currently manages over $800
billion in assets, will play a significant role in studying and implementing
the proposed fund. The aim is to develop the local economy, attract foreign
investment, and finance major projects to promote economic diversification in
Kuwait.

Future Generations Fund

The Future Generations Fund (FGF) was created in 1976 by transferring 50% from
the general reserve fund at that time. The FGF is a saving funds for future
generations. 25% of all state revenues are annually transferred to the fund.

All of the FGF is invested abroad, with an estimated 75% invested in the US
and Europe and the rest in emerging markets, mainly China and India.

## Health

Kuwait has a state-funded healthcare system, which provides treatment without
charge to Kuwaiti nationals. There are outpatient clinics in every residential
area in Kuwait. A public insurance scheme exists to provide reduced cost
healthcare to expatriates. Private healthcare providers also run medical
facilities in the country, available to members of their insurance schemes. As
part of Kuwait Vision 2035, many new hospitals have opened. In the years
leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kuwait invested in its health care system
at a rate that was proportionally higher than most other GCC countries. As a
result, the public hospital sector significantly increased its capacity.
Kuwait currently has 20 public hospitals. The new Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad
Hospital is considered the largest hospital in the Middle East. Kuwait also
has 16 private hospitals.

## Entrepreneurship

In the past five years, there has been a significant rise in entrepreneurship
and small business creation in Kuwait. The informal sector is also on the
rise, mainly due to the popularity of Instagram businesses. In 2020, Kuwait
ranked fourth in the MENA region in startup funding after the UAE, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.

Many Kuwaiti entrepreneurs use the Instagram-based business model.

## Tourism

The Palms Beach Hotel & Spa in Kuwait

In 2020, Kuwait's domestic travel and tourism spending reached $6.1 billion
(up from $1.6 billion in 2019) with family tourism a rapidly growing segment.
The WTTC named Kuwait as one of the world's fastest-growing countries in
travel and tourism GDP in 2019, with 11.6% year-on-year growth. In 2016, the
tourism industry generated nearly $500 million in revenue. In 2015, tourism
accounted for 1.5 percent of the GDP.

In 2023, there was a rise in the spending of Kuwaiti citizens on tourism and
travel, recorded to be 4.39 billion dinars, marking an increase of 9.2% from
the 4 billion dinars recorded in 2022. The surge in tourism expenditures is
largely attributable to the introduction of new travel destinations, expanded
offerings from airlines catering to family travel, and an increase in interest
in events like the Riyadh Season and other festivities. The first quarter of
2023 saw the highest spending (1.36 billion dinars), followed by the second
(1.01 billion dinars), third (1.15 billion dinars), and the fourth (870
million dinars), making it the year with the highest spending on travel by
Kuwaiti citizens since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover,
spending by foreign tourists in Kuwait increased by approximately 60%,
reaching 533.3 million dinars by the end of 2023, up from 332.6 million dinars
in 2022.

The Amiri Diwan recently inaugurated the new Kuwait National Cultural District
(KNCD), which comprises Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre, Sheikh Jaber
Al Ahmad Cultural Centre, Al Shaheed Park, and Al Salam Palace. With a capital
cost of more than US$1 billion, the project is one of the largest cultural
investments in the world. In November 2016, the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural
Centre opened. It is the largest cultural centre and opera house in the Middle
East. The Kuwait National Cultural District is a member of the Global Cultural
Districts Network. The annual "Hala Febrayer" festival attracts tourists from
neighboring GCC countries, and includes a variety of events including music
concerts, parades, and carnivals. The festival is a month-long commemoration
of the liberation of Kuwait, and runs from 1 to 28 February. Liberation Day
itself is celebrated on 26 February.

## Science and technology

According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Kuwait registered
448 patents as of 31 December 2015, In the early to mid 2010s, Kuwait
registered the largest number of scientific publications and patents per
capita regionally. The Kuwaiti government has implemented various programs to
foster innovation resulting in patent rights. The WIPO Global Innovation Index
found that Kuwait ranks 71st over 139 (for its innovation efficiency ratio
(which shows how much innovation output a country is getting for its inputs).

Kuwait was the first country in the region to implement 5G technology. Kuwait
is among the world's leading countries in 5G penetration. The Chinese company
Huawei has a $1.7 billion investment license in Kuwait to develop the
country's ICT sector in line with the Kuwait Vision 2035 strategy.

### Space

Kuwait Space Rocket

Kuwait has an emerging space industry driven by the private sector.

Kuwait's first satellite

Kuwait's Orbital Space in collaboration with the Space Challenges Program and
EnduroSat introduced an international initiative called "Code in Space". The
initiative allows students from around the world to send and execute their own
code in space. The code is transmitted from a satellite ground station to a
cubesat (nanosatellite) orbiting Earth 500 km (310 mi) above sea level. The
code is then executed by the satellite's onboard computer and tested under
real space environment conditions. The nanosatellite is called "QMR-KWT"
(Arabic: قمر الكويت) which means "Moon of Kuwait", translated from Arabic.

QMR-KWT launched to space on 30 June 2021 on SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket
and was part of the payload of a satellite carrier called ION SCV Dauntless
David by D-Orbit. It was deployed into its final orbit (Sun-synchronous orbit)
on 16 July 2021. QMR-KWT is Kuwait's first satellite.

Um Alaish 4

Seven years after the launch of the world's first communications satellite,
Telstar 1, Kuwait in October 1969 inaugurated the first satellite ground
station in the Middle East, "Um Alaish". The Um Alaish satellite station
complex housed several satellite ground stations including Um Alaish 1 (1969),
Um Alaish 2 (1977), and Um Alaish 3 (1981). It provided satellite
communication services in Kuwait until 1990 when it was destroyed by the Iraqi
armed forces during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. In 2019, Kuwait's Orbital
Space established an amateur satellite ground station to provide free access
to signals from satellites in orbit passing over Kuwait. The station was named
Um Alaish 4 to continue the legacy of "Um Alaish" satellite station. Um Alaish
4 is member of FUNcube distributed ground station network and the Satellite
Networked Open Ground Station project (SatNOGS).

Kuwait Space Rocket

The Kuwait Space Rocket (KSR) is a Kuwaiti project to build and launch the
first suborbital liquid bi-propellant rocket in Arabia. The project is divided
into two phases with two separate vehicles: an initial testing phase with
KSR-1 as a test vehicle capable of reaching an altitude of 8 km (5.0 mi) and a
more expansive suborbital test phase with the KSR-2 planned to fly to an
altitude of 100 km (62 mi).

TSCK experiment in space

Kuwait's Orbital Space in collaboration with the Kuwait Scientific Center
(TSCK) introduced for the first time in Kuwait the opportunity for students to
send a science experiment to space. The objectives of this initiative was to
allow students to learn about (a) how science space missions are done; (b)
microgravity (weightlessness) environment; (c) how to do science like a real
scientist. This opportunity was made possible through Orbital Space agreement
with DreamUp PBC and Nanoracks LLC, which are collaborating with NASA under a
Space Act Agreement. The students' experiment was named "Kuwait’s Experiment:
E.coli Consuming Carbon Dioxide to Combat Climate Change". The experiment was
launched on SpaceX CRS-21 (SpX-21) spaceflight to the International Space
Station (ISS) on 6 December 2020. Astronauts Shannon Walker (member of the ISS
Expedition 64) conducted the experiment on behalf of the students.

National satellite project

In July 2021, Kuwait University announced that it is launching a national
satellite project as part of state-led efforts to pioneer the country's
sustainable space sector.

## Transport

A highway in Kuwait City

Kuwait has a modern network of highways. Roadways extended 5,749 km (3,572
mi), of which 4,887 km (3,037 mi) is paved. There are more than 2 million
passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On
major highways the maximum speed is 120 km/h (75 mph). Since there is no
railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.

The country's public transportation network consists almost entirely of bus
routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established
in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance
services to other Gulf states. The main private bus company is CityBus, which
operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company,
Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local
bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab
countries.

There are two airports in Kuwait. Kuwait International Airport serves as the
principal hub for international air travel. State-owned Kuwait Airways is the
largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated
as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the Kuwait Air
Force, as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private
airline of Kuwait, Jazeera Airways, was launched. In 2005, the second private
airline, Wataniya Airways was founded.

Kuwait has one of the largest shipping industries in the region. The Kuwait
Ports Public Authority manages and operates ports across Kuwait. The country's
principal commercial seaports are Shuwaikh and Shuaiba which handled combined
cargo of 753,334 TEU in 2006. Mina Al-Ahmadi, the largest port in the country,
handles most of Kuwait's oil exports. Mubarak Al Kabeer Port in Bubiyan Island
is currently under construction. The port is expected to handle 2 million TEU
when operations start.

In 2019, Kuwait's main export products were mineral fuels including oil (89.1%
of total exports), aircraft and spacecraft (4.3%), organic chemicals (3.2%),
plastics (1.2%), iron and steel (0.2%), gems and precious metals (0.1%),
machinery including computers (0.1%), aluminum (0.1%), copper (0.1%), and
salt, sulphur, stone and cement (0.1%). Kuwait was the world's biggest
exporter of sulfonated, nitrated and nitrosated hydrocarbons in 2019. Kuwait
was ranked 63rd out of 157 countries in the 2019 Economic Complexity Index
(ECI). Iraq was Kuwait's leading export market in 2019 and food/agricultural
products accounted for 94.2% of total export commodities.

According to data from the Civil Service Commission (CSC), the level of
joblessness amongst the Kuwaiti population continues to rise annually as of
2024. This is predominately due to a surplus of graduates in fields that lack
demand within the workforce, as well as a discrepancy between labor market
requirements and the skills obtained through certain specializations.
Additional issues contributing to the unemployment rate include a lack of
emphasis on the private sector and insufficient coordination among related
authorities. Until substantial changes are made regarding the quality of
educational outputs, the number of graduates in less required fields is likely
to keep rising, further exacerbating unemployment issues. Statistics from the
Central Statistics Bureau as of November 19, 2023 indicate that there are
8,727 unemployed Kuwaitis, including 4,177 males (approximately 48 percent)
and 4,550 females (approximately 52 percent).

According to recent statistics released by the Central Statistics Bureau, the
population of Kuwait rose to 4.91 million on January 1, 2024 — an increase of
119,700 from 2024's 4.79 million population. The number of Kuwaiti citizens
increased by 28,700, totaling 1.545 million, an increase from the 1.517
million figure from the start of 2023. Notably, the number of male citizens
reached 758,700 and female citizens rose to 787,000 in January 2024.
Additionally, the expatriate population witnessed a rise by 90,990, reaching
3.36 million, among which the male expatriates accounted for 2.26 million and
female expatriates stood at 1.1 million in the same period.
