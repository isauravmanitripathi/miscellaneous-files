The **economy of Jamaica** is heavily reliant on services, accounting for 71%
of the country's GDP. Jamaica has natural resources and a climate conducive to
agriculture and tourism. The discovery of bauxite in the 1940s and the
subsequent establishment of the bauxite-alumina industry shifted Jamaica's
economy from sugar, and bananas.

Weakness in the financial sector, speculation, and lower levels of investment
erode confidence in the productive sector. The government continues its
efforts to raise new sovereign debt in local and international financial
markets to meet its U.S. dollar debt obligations, to mop up liquidity to
maintain the exchange rate and to help fund the current budget deficit.

The Jamaican government's economic policies encourage foreign investment in
areas that earn or save foreign exchange, generate employment, and use local
raw materials. The government also provides a wide range of incentives to
investors.

Free trade zones have stimulated investment in garment assembly, light
manufacturing, and data entry by foreign firms. However, over the last 5
years[_when?_], the garment industry has suffered from reduced export
earnings, continued factory closures, and rising unemployment. The Government
of Jamaica hopes to encourage economic activity through a combination of
privatisation, financial sector restructuring, reduced interest rates, and by
boosting tourism and related productive activities.

## Economic history

Before independence, Jamaica's economy was largely focused on agriculture with
the vast majority of the labour force engaged in the production of sugar,
bananas, and tobacco. According to one study, 18th century Jamaica had the
highest wealth inequality in the world, as a very small, slave-owning elite
was extremely wealthy while the rest of the population lived on the edge of
subsistence.

These products were mainly exported to the United Kingdom, Canada, and to the
United States of America. Jamaica's trade relationships expanded substantially
from 1938 to 1946, with total imports almost doubling from £6,485,000 to
£12,452,000. After 1962, the Jamaican government pushed for economic growth
and all sectors excluding bauxite/alumina, energy, and tourism had shrunk
between 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Jamaica experienced its first year of positive
growth since 1995 due to continued tight macroeconomic policies.

Inflation fell from 25% in 1995 to single digits in 2000, reaching a
multidecade low of 4.3% in 2004. Through periodic intervention in the market,
the central bank also has prevented any abrupt drop in the exchange rate. The
Jamaican dollar has been slipping, despite intervention, resulting in an
average exchange rate of J$73.40 per US$1.00 and J136.2 per €1.00 (February
2011). In addition, inflation has been trending upward since 2004 and is
projected to once again reach a double digit rate of 12–13% through the year
2008 due to a combination of unfavorable weather damaging crops and increasing
agricultural imports and high energy prices.

Over the last 30 years, real per capita GDP increased at an average of just
one per cent per year, making Jamaica one of the slowest growing developing
countries in the world.

To reverse this trajectory, the Government of Jamaica embarked on a
comprehensive and ambitious program of reforms for which it has garnered
national and international support: a four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) providing a support package of US$932
million; World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
programs providing US$510 million each to facilitate the GoJ's economic reform
agenda to stabilise the economy, reduce debt and create the conditions for
growth and resilience.. In addition, the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will continue to
support private sector development.

The reform program is beginning to bear fruit: Institutional reforms and
measures to improve the environment for the private sector have started to
restore confidence in the Jamaican economy. Jamaica jumped 27 places to 58
among 189 economies worldwide in the 2015 Doing Business ranking, the
country's credit rating has improved and the Government has successfully
raised more than US$2 billion in the international capital in the markets in
2014 and 2015..

Despite some revival, economic growth is still low: the Jamaican Government is
forecasting real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.9 per cent for the
fiscal year 2015/2016 and the country continues to be confronted by serious
social issues that predominantly affect youth, such as high levels of crime
and violence and high unemployment. Jamaica, which had seen its poverty rate
drop almost 20 per cent over two decades, saw it increase by eight per cent in
a few years.

The unemployment rate in Jamaica is approximately 6.0% (April 2022,
Statistical Institute of Jamaica), with youth unemployment more than twice the
national rate, albeit trending downwards (15%). However, among Jamaica's
assets are its skilled labour force and strong social and governance
indicators.

## Primary industries

### Agriculture

Agricultural production is an important contributor to Jamaica's economy.
However, it is vulnerable to extreme weather, such as hurricanes and to
competition from neighbouring countries such as the USA. Other difficulties
faced by farmers include thefts from the farm, known as praedial larceny.
Agricultural production accounted for 7.4% of GDP in 1997, providing
employment for nearly a quarter of the country. Jamaica's agriculture,
together with forestry and fishing, accounted for about 6.6% of GDP in 1999.
Sugar has been produced in Jamaica for centuries, it is the nation's dominant
agricultural export. Sugar is produced in nearly every parish. The production
of raw sugar in the year 2000 was estimated at 175,000 tons, a decrease from
290,000 tons in 1978.

Jamaican agriculture has been less prominent in GDP in the 2000s than other
industries, hitting an all-time low between 2004 and 2008. This may have been
due to a reaction to increased competition as international trade policies
were enacted. For example, as NAFTA was enacted in 1993, a significant amount
of Caribbean exports to the United States diminished, being out competed by
Latin American exports. Another example is the Banana Import Regime's 3rd
phase, in which EU nations had first given priority in banana imports to
previously colonised nations. Under pressure by the World Trade Organization,
the EU policy was altered to provide a non-discriminatory trade agreement.
Jamaica's banana industry was easily outpriced by American companies exporting
Latin American goods. Jamaica's agriculture industry is now bouncing back,
growing from being 6.6% of GDP to 7.2%.

Sugar formed 7.1% of the exports in 1999 and Jamaica made up about 4.8% of the
total production of sugar in the Caribbean. Sugar is also used for the
production of by-products such as molasses, rum and some wallboard is made
from bagasse.

Banana production in 1999 was 130,000 tons. Bananas formed 2.4% of the exports
in 1999 and Jamaica formed around 7.5% of the total production of banana in
the Caribbean. Jamaica stopped exporting banana in 2008 after suffering from
several years of hurricanes that devastated the plantations.

Coffee is mainly grown around the Blue Mountains and in hilly areas. One type
in particular, Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, is considered among the best in
the world because at those heights in the Blue Mountains, the cooler climate
causes the berries to take longer to ripen and the beans develop more of the
substances which on roasting give coffee its flavor. Coffee formed 1.9% of
exports in 1999. The picking season lasts from August to March. The coffee is
exported from Kingston.

Cocoa is grown throughout Jamaica and local sales absorb about 1/3 of the
output to be made into instant drinks and confectionery. Citrus fruit is
mainly grown in the central parts of Jamaica, particularly between the
elevations of 1,000–2,500 feet. The picking season lasts from November to
April. Two factories in Bog Walk produce fruit juices, canned fruit, essential
oils and marmalade. Coconuts are grown on the northern and eastern coasts,
which provide enough copra to supply factories to make butterine, margarine,
lard, edible oil and laundry soap.

Vanilla is also grown.

Other export crops are pimento, ginger, tobacco, sisal and other fruit are
exported. Rice is grown around swampy areas around the Black River & around
Long Bay in Hanover and Westmoreland parishes for local consumption.

As tastes have changed in Jamaica in favour of more meat and packaged food the
national food import bill has grown to the point that it threatens the health
of the economy. The government has responded by encouraging gardening and
farming, a response which has had limited success. For example, the percentage
of potatoes grown locally has increased, but imports of french fries have
continued at a high level.

### Animal husbandry

Cows Grazing, Saint Ann Parish 2023

Pastures form a good percentage of the land in Jamaica. Many properties
specialise in cattle rearing. Livestock holdings include 400,000 head of
cattle, 440,000 goats and 180,000 pigs. Dairying has increased since the
erection of a condensed milk factory at Bog Walk in 1940. Even so, the supply
of dairy products is not enough for local requirements and there are large
imports of powdered milk, butter and cheese.

### Fishing

White River Fishing Village is in Ocho Rios, St. Ann

The fishing industry grew during the 1900s, primarily from the focus on inland
fishing. Several thousand fishermen make a living from fishing. The shallow
waters and cays off the south coast are richer than the northern waters. Other
fishermen live on the Pedro Cays, 80 miles (130 km) to the south of Jamaica.
Jamaica supplies about half of its fish requirements; major imports of frozen
and salted fish are imported from the United States and Canada.

The total catch in 2000 was 5,676 tons, a decrease from 11,458 tons in 1997;
the catch was mainly marine, with freshwater carp, barbel, etc., crustaceans &
molluscs.

### Forestry

By the late 1890, only 185,000 hectares (460,000 acres) of Jamaica's original
1,000,000 hectares (2,500,000 acres) of forest remained. Roundwood production
was 881,000 cu m (31.1 million cu ft) in 2000. About 68% of the timber cut in
2000 was used as fuel wood while 32% was used for industrial use. The forests
that once covered Jamaica now exist only in mountainous areas. They only
supply 20% of the island timber requirements. The remaining forest is
protected from further exploitation. Other accessible mountain areas are being
reforested, mainly with pines, mahoe and mahogany.

### Mining

Windalco, Alumina plant in the background (Kirkvine, Manchester)

Jamaica was the third-leading producer of bauxite and alumina in 1998,
producing 12.6 million tons of bauxite, accounting for 10.4% of world
production, and 3.46 million tons of alumina, accounting for 7.4% of world
production. 8,540 million tons of bauxite was mined in 2012 and 10,200 million
tons of bauxite in 2011.

Mining and quarrying made up 4.1% of the nation's gross domestic product in
1999. Bauxite and alumina formed 55.2% of exports in 1999 and are the second-
leading money earner after tourism. Jamaica has reserves of over 2 billion
tonnes, which are expected to last 100 years. Bauxite is found in the central
parishes of St. Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, St. Catherine, St. Ann, and
Trelawny. There are four alumina plants and six mines.

Jamaica has deposits of several million tons of gypsum on the southern slopes
of the Blue Mountains. Jamaica produced 330,441 tons of gypsum in the year
2000, some of which was used in the local cement industry and in the
manufacturing of building materials.

Other minerals present in Jamaica include marble, limestone, and silica, as
well as ores of copper, lead, zinc, manganese and iron. Some of these are
worked in small quantities. Petroleum has been sought, but so far none has
been found.

## Secondary Industries

### Manufacturing

The manufacturing sector is an essential contributor to the Jamaican economy.
Though manufacturing accounted for 13.9% of GDP in 1999. Jamaican companies
contribute many manufactures such as food processing; oil refining; produced
chemicals, construction materials, plastic goods, paints, pharmaceuticals,
cartons, leather goods and cigars & assembled electronics, textiles and
apparel. The garment industry is a major job employer for thousands of
hundreds of locals and they formed 12.9% of exports in 1999 earning US$159
million. Chemicals formed 3.3% of the exports in 1999 earning US$40 million.

A portion of the bauxite mined on the island is processed into alumina before
export.

An oil refinery is located near Kingston converts crude petroleum obtained
from Venezuela into gasoline and other products. These are mainly for local
use. The construction industry is growing due to new hotels and attractions
being built for tourism. Construction and installation formed 10.4% of the GDP
in 1999.

Manufactured goods were imported and formed 30.3% of the imports and cost
US$877 million in 1999.

Since the launch of the Jamaican Logistics Hub initiative, various economic
zones have been proposed throughout the country to assemble goods from other
parts of the world for distribution to the Americas.

## Tertiary industries

### Tourism

Tourism is tied with remittances as Jamaica's top source of revenue. The
tourism industry earns over 50 per cent of the country's total foreign
exchange earnings and provides about one-fourth of all jobs in Jamaica. Most
tourist activity is centered on the island's northern coast, including the
communities of Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and Port Antonio, as well as in Negril
on the island's western tip.

Some destinations include Ocho Rios, Green Grotto Caves, Y.S. Falls and
Appleton Estate. Most of the tourist sites are landmarks as well as homes for
many Jamaicans. Many of the most frequented tourist sites are located mainly
by water such as rivers and beaches where fishermen make a living from
seafood. One of the most famous beach towns in Jamaica is Ocho Rios, a located
in the parish of Saint Ann on the north coast of Jamaica. It was once a
fishing village but now attracts millions of tourists yearly. The site is
popular today because of the food and culture that can be found there.

Another famous location in Jamaica that attracts millions yearly is Dunn's
River Falls, located in Ocho Rios; this waterfall is approximately 600 feet
long and runs off into the sea. Around the location many hotels and
restaurants are available and many street vendors sell food around the clock.
Another well-known beach town is Negril, the party capital of the country.
This beach town has many different factors to add to the night life.

### Logistics

In April 2014, the Governments of Jamaica and China signed the preliminary
agreements for the first phase of the Jamaican Logistics Hub (JLH) – the
initiative that aims to position Kingston as the fourth node in the global
logistics chain, joining Rotterdam, Dubai and Singapore, and serving the
Americas. The Project, when completed, is expected to provide many jobs for
Jamaicans, Economic Zones for multinational companies and much needed economic
growth to alleviate the country's heavy debt-to-GDP ratio. Strict adherence to
the IMF's refinancing programme and preparations for the JLH has favourably
affected Jamaica's credit rating and outlook from the three biggest rating
agencies.

### ICT/BPO

Jamaica has made strides in developing its Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) infrastructure.

As the largest English speaking territory in the Caribbean, Jamaica is the
region's leading contact centre location with over 87 information
communications technology/business process outsourcing (ICT/BPO) companies
operating in the country employing 44,000 full-time agents.

## Taxation/Tax Rates

Jamaican tax rates are extremely favourable in world standards, the brackets
are as follows:

Band | Personal Allowance (J$) | Tax Rate   
---|---|---  
1 (Lower) -Up to | J$1,500,000 | 0%   
2 (Middle) – J$1,500,001-J$6,000,000 | J$1,500,000 | 25%   
3 (Upper) – J$6,000,000+ | J$0 | 30%   
  
Separate Tax Rates apply for foreign nationals.
