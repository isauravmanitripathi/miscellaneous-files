The **economy of Spain** is a highly developed social market economy. It is
the world's 12th largest by nominal GDP and the sixth-largest in Europe (fifth
excluding Russia). Spain is a member of the European Union and the eurozone,
as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the
World Trade Organization. In 2023, Spain was the 18th-largest exporter in the
world. Meanwhile, in 2022, Spain was the 15th-largest importer in the world.
Spain is listed 27th in the United Nations Human Development Index and 29th in
GDP per capita by the International Monetary Fund. Some main areas of economic
activity are the automotive industry, medical technology, chemicals,
shipbuilding, tourism and the textile industry. Among OECD members, Spain has
a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly
23% of GDP.

During the Great Recession, Spain's economy was also in a recession. Compared
to the EU and US averages, the Spanish economy entered recession later, but
stayed there longer. The boom of the 2000s was reversed, leaving over a
quarter of Spain's workforce unemployed by 2012. In aggregate, GDP contracted
almost 9% during 2009–2013. In 2012, the government officially requested a
credit from the European Stability Mechanism to restructure its banking sector
in the face of the crisis. The ESM approved assistance and Spain drew €41
billion. The ESM programme for Spain ended with the full repayment of the
credit drawn 18 months later.

The economic situation started improving by 2013. By then, Spain managed to
reverse the record trade deficit which had built up during the boom years. It
attained a trade surplus in 2013, after three decades of running a deficit. In
2015, GDP grew by 3.2%: a rate not seen since 2007. In 2014–2015, the economy
recovered 85% of the GDP lost during the 2009–2013 recession. This success led
some analysts to refer to Spain's recovery as "the showcase for structural
reform efforts". Spain's unemployment fell substantially from 2013 to 2017.
Real unemployment is much lower, as millions work in the grey market, people
who count as unemployed yet perform jobs. Real Spanish GDP may be around 20%
bigger, as it is assumed the underground economy is annually 190 billion euros
(US$224 billion). Among high income European countries, only Italy and Greece
are believed to have larger underground economies. Thus Spain may have higher
purchasing power as well as a smaller gini coefficient (inequality measure),
than shown in official numbers.

The 2020 pandemic hit the Spanish economy with more intensity than other
countries, as foreign tourism accounts for 5% of GDP. In the first quarter of
2023, it had fully recovered from the downturn, its GDP reaching pre-pandemic
levels. In 2023, Spain's economy grew 2.5%, bucking a downturn in the eurozone
as a whole, and is expected to grow at 3.1% in 2024, and 2.5% in 2025.

According to Eurostat data, in 2024 Spain reached 92% of the European Union’s
average GDP per capita, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). This
figure reflects a continued trend of economic convergence that began in the
aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the course of this progression, Spain
has surpassed countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia and South Korea,
establishing itself as one of the EU economies that has most significantly
narrowed the gap with the European core over the past five years.

Evolution of Spain's nominal GDP since 2000 (in trillions of euros)

## History

Real GDP per capita development Spain

During the first decades of the twentieth century, Spain experienced an
accelerated growth of its industrial labor force and urban population; the
economy became less agrarian as the process of urbanization spread after 1910.
The largest sector was still agriculture but saw declines, along with fishery,
relative to the share of active population engaged in the activity. The
fastest growing sector at that time was services.

When Spain joined the EEC in 1986 its GDP per capita was about 72% of the
average of its members.

At the second half of the 1990s, the conservative government of former prime
minister Jose María Aznar had worked successfully to gain admission to the
group of countries joining the euro in 1999. By the mid-1990s the economy had
commenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the
early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the
government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate
began to steadily decline. With the government budget in balance and inflation
under control Spain was admitted into the eurozone in 1999. By 2007, Spain had
achieved a GDP per capita of 105% of European Union's average due to its own
economic development and the EU enlargements to 28 members, which placed it
slightly ahead of Italy (103%). Three regions were included in the leading EU
group exceeding 125% of the GDP per capita average level: the Basque Country,
Madrid, and Navarre. According to calculations by the German newspaper _Die
Welt_ in 2008, Spain's economy had been on course to overtake countries like
Germany in per capita income by 2011. in October 2006, Unemployment stood at
7.6% which compared favorably to many other European countries, and especially
with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%. In the past, Spain's economy
had included high inflation and it has always had a large underground economy.

The turn to growth during the 1997-2007 period produced a real estate bubble
fed by historically low interest rates, massive rates of foreign investment
(during that period Spain had become a favorite of other European investment
banks) and an immense surge in immigration. At its peak in 2007, construction
had expanded to 15% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the country
and 12% of total employment. During that time Spain capital inflows –including
short term speculative investment– financed a large trade deficit.

The downside of the real estate boom was a corresponding rise in the levels of
private debt, both of households and of businesses; as prospective homeowners
had struggled to meet asking prices, the average level of household debt
tripled in less than a decade. This placed especially great pressure upon
lower to middle income groups; by 2005 the median ratio of indebtedness to
income had grown to 125%, due primarily to expensive boom time mortgages that
now often exceed the value of the property.

Noticeable progress continued until early 2008, when the 2008 financial crisis
burst Spain's property bubble.

A European Commission forecast had predicted Spain would enter the world's
late 2000s recession by the end of 2008. At the time, Spain's Economy Minister
was quoted saying, "Spain is facing its deepest recession in half a century".
Spain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 16% in 2009.
The ESADE business school predicted 20%. By 2017, Spain's GDP per capita had
fallen back to 95% of the European Union's average.

### 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis

---|---  
  
Like most economies, Spain's economy had been steadily growing, regardless of
political changes e.g. when the ruling party changed in 2004. It maintained
robust growth during the first term of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez
Zapatero, even though problems were becoming evident. According to the
_Financial Times_ , Spain's rapidly growing trade deficit had reached 10% of
GDP by summer 2008, the "loss of competitiveness against its main trading
partners" and as a part of the latter, inflation which had been traditionally
higher than its European competitors. This was especially affected by house
price increases of 150% from 1998 and growing private sector indebtedness
(115%), chiefly related to the Spanish Real Estate boom and rocketing oil
prices.

In April 2008, the Spanish government growth forecast was 2.3%, but this was
revised down by the Ministry of Economy to 1.6%. Studies by independent
forecasters estimated it had actually dropped to 0.8%, below the strong 3%
plus growth rates during 1997–2007. During Q3 of 2008 the GDP contracted for
the first time in 15 years. In February 2009, it was confirmed that Spain,
along other European economies, had entered recession.

  * 31-31.9

  * 32-32.9

In July 2009, the IMF worsened the estimates for Spain's 2009 contraction, to
-4% of GDP, close to the European average of -4.6%. It estimated a further
0.8% contraction for Spain, in 2010. In 2011, the deficit reached a high of
8.5%. For 2016 the deficit objective of the government was around 4%, falling
to 3% for 2017. The European Commission demanded 4% for 2016 and 2.5% for
2017.

#### Property boom and bust, 2003–2014

The adoption of the euro in 2002 had driven down long-term interest rates,
prompting a surge in mortgage lending that jumped fourfold from 2000 to its
2010 apex. The growth in the property market, which had begun in 1997,
accelerated and within a few years had developed into a property bubble. It
was financed largely by "Cajas", which are regional savings banks under the
oversight of regional governments, and was fed by the historically low
interest rates and a massive growth of immigration. Fueling this trend, the
economy was being credited for having avoided the almost zero of some of its
largest partners in the EU, in the months previous to the global Great
Recession.

Over the five years ending 2005, Spain's economy had created more than half of
all new jobs in the EU. At the top of its property boom, Spain was building
more houses than Germany, France and the UK combined. Home prices soared by
71% between 2003 and 2008, in tandem with the credit explosion.

The bubble imploded in 2008, causing the collapse of Spain's large property
related and construction sectors, causing mass layoffs, and a collapsing
domestic demand for goods and services. Unemployment shot up. At first,
Spain's banks and financial services avoided the early crisis of their
international counterparts. However, as the recession deepened and property
prices slid, the growing bad debts of the smaller regional savings banks,
forced the intervention of Spain's central bank and government through a
stabilization and consolidation program, taking over or consolidating regional
_"cajas"_ , and finally receiving a bank bailout from the European Central
Bank in 2012, aimed specifically for the banking business and "_cajas"_ in
particular. Following the 2008 peak, home prices plunged by 31%, before
bottoming out in late 2014.

#### Euro debt crisis, 2010-2012

Spain is part of a monetary union, the eurozone (dark blue), and the European
single market.

In the first weeks of 2010, renewed anxiety about excessive debt in some EU
countries and, more generally, about the health of the euro spread from
Ireland and Greece to Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain. Many economists
recommended a battery of policies to control the surging public debt caused by
the recessionary collapse of tax revenues, combining drastic austerity
measures with higher taxes. Some German policymakers went as far as to say
that bailouts should include harsh penalties to EU aid recipients, such as
Greece. The Spanish government budget was in surplus in the years immediately
before the Great Recession, and its debt was not considered excessive.

At the beginning of 2010, Spain's public debt as a percentage of GDP was still
less than those of Britain, France or Germany. However, commentators pointed
out that Spain's recovery was fragile, that the public debt was growing
quickly, troubled regional banks may need large bailouts, growth prospects
were poor and therefore limiting revenue, and that the central government had
limited control over the spending of the regional governments. Under the
structure of shared governmental responsibilities that has evolved since 1975,
much responsibility for spending had been given back to the regions. The
central government found itself in the position of trying to gain support for
unpopular spending cuts from the recalcitrant regional governments. In May
2010, the government announced further austerity measures, consolidating the
ambitious plans announced in January.

As of September 2011, Spanish banks held a record high of €142 billion of
Spanish national bonds. Till Q2 2012, Spanish banks were allowed to report
real estate related assets in higher non-market price by regulators. Investors
who bought into such banks must be aware. Spanish houses cannot be sold at
land book value after being vacant over a period of years.[_citation needed_]

#### Employment crisis

Torres de la Casería de Ossio apartment buildings in San Fernando completed in
2007. The collapse of the Spanish construction boom was a major contributor to
the record unemployment.

After having completed large improvements over the second half of the 1990s
and during the 2000s, Spain attained in 2007 its record low unemployment rate,
at about 8%, with some regions on the brink of full employment. Then Spain
suffered a severe setback from October 2008, when it saw its unemployment rate
surge. Between October 2007 – October 2008 the surge exceeded that of past
economic crises, including 1993. In particular, during October 2008, Spain
suffered its worst unemployment rise ever recorded. Even though the sheer size
of Spain's underground economy masked the real situation, employment has been
a long term weakness of the economy. By 2014 the structural unemployment rate
was estimated at 18%. By July 2009, Spain had shed 1.2 million jobs in one
year. The oversized building and housing related industries were contributing
greatly to the rising unemployment. From 2009 thousands of established
immigrants began to leave, although some did maintain residency due to poor
conditions in their country of origin. In all, by early 2013 Spain reached an
unprecedented unemployment record at about 27%.

In 2012 a radical labor reform made for a more flexible labor market,
facilitating layoffs with a view to enhancing business confidence.

##### Youth

During the early 1990s, Spain experienced economic crisis as a result of a
Europe-wide economic episode that led to a rise in unemployment. Many young
adults found themselves trapped in a cycle of temporary jobs, which resulted
in the creation of a secondary class of workers through reduced wages, job
stability and advancement opportunities. As a result, many Spaniards,
predominantly unmarried young adults, emigrated to pursue job opportunities
and raise their quality of life, which left only a small amount of young
adults living below the poverty line. Spain experienced another economic
crisis during the 2000s, which also prompted a rise in emigration to
neighboring countries with more job stability and better economic standing.

Youth unemployment remains a concern, prompting suggestions of labor market
programs and job-search assistance like matching youth skills with businesses.
This would improve Spain's weakened youth labor market, and their school to
work transition, as young people have found it difficult to find long-term
employment. As of January 2025, the youth unemployment in Spain stands at
24.9%.

##### Employment recovery

The labor market reform started a trend of setting successive positive
employment records. By Q2 of 2014, the economy had reversed its negative trend
and started creating jobs for the first time since 2008. The second quarter
reversal had been extraordinary; jobs created set an absolute positive record
since such quarterly employment statistics began in 1964. Labor reform did
seem to play an important role; one piece of evidence cited was that Spain had
started creating jobs at lower rates of GDP growth than before: in previous
cycles, employment rose when growth hit 2%, this time the gain came during a
year when GDP had expanded by just 1.2%.

Greater than expected GDP growth paved the way for further decline in
unemployment. Since 2014, Spain registered steady annual falls in the official
jobless figure. During 2016, unemployment experienced the steepest fall on
record. By the end of 2016, Spain had recovered 1.7m of the more than 3.5m
jobs lost over the recession. By Q4 2016 Spanish unemployment had fallen to
19%, the lowest rate in seven years. In April 2017 the country recorded its
biggest drop in jobless claimants for a single month to date. In Q2 of 2017,
unemployment fell to 17%, below 4 million for the first time since 2008, with
the country experiencing its steepest quarterly decline in unemployment on
record. In 2018, at 14.6% the unemployment rate did not exceed the 15%
threshold for the first time since 2008 when the crisis began.

As of 2017, trade unions, left, and center-left parties continued to criticize
and wanted labor reform to be revoked, on grounds that it tilted the balance
of power too far towards employers. Most new contracts were temporary. In
2019, Pedro Sánchez's socialist government increased the minimum wage by 22%
in an attempt to boost hiring and encourage spending, and increased it further
in the labor reform adopted at the end of 2021. Members of the opposition
argued this increase, would negatively affect 1.2 million workers due to
employers being unable to cover the raise, resulting in higher unemployment.
Contrary to such opinion, the reforms approved by Sanchez's government
resulted in a robust shift towards permanent employment contracts, and led to
a 15-year low in unemployment rates at 11.60%.

#### Reduction of European Union funds

Capital contributions from the EU, which had contributed significantly to the
economic empowerment of Spain since joining the EEC, have decreased
considerably since 1990, due to the effects of the EU's enlargement.
Agricultural funds from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union
(CAP) are now spread across more countries. And, with 2004 and 2007's
enlargement of the European Union, less developed countries joined, lowering
average income, so that Spanish regions which had been relatively less
developed, were now at the European average or even above it. Spain has
gradually become a net contributor of funds for less developed countries of
the Union, as opposed to receiving funds.

#### Economic recovery (2014–2020)

During the economic downturn, Spain significantly reduced imports, increased
exports and attracted growing numbers of tourists; as a result, after three
decades of running a trade deficit the country attained in 2013 a trade
surplus which strengthened during 2014–15.

With a 3.2% increase in 2015, growth was the highest among larger EU
economies. In two years (2014–2015) the economy had recovered 85% of the GDP
lost during the 2009-2013 recession, which had some international analysts
referring to Spain's recovery as "the showcase for structural reform efforts".
The Spanish economy outperformed expectations and grew 3.2% in 2016, faster
than the eurozone average. One of the main drivers of recovery was
international trade, in turn sparked by dramatic gains in labor productivity.
Exports shot up, from around 25% (2008) to 33% of GDP (2016) on the back of an
internal devaluation (the country's wage bill halved in 2008–2016), a search
for new markets, and a mild recovery of the European economy. In the second
quarter of 2017 Spain had recovered all the GDP lost during the economic
crisis, exceeding for the first time output in 2008.

By 2017, following several months of prices increasing, homeowners who had
been renting during the economic slump had started to put their properties
back on the market. In this regard, home sales are expected to return in 2017
to pre-crisis (2008) level. The Spanish real estate market was experiencing a
new boom, this time in the rental sector. Out of 50 provinces and compared to
May 2007, the National Statistics Institute recorded higher rent levels in 48
provinces, with the 10 most populated accumulating rent inflation between 5%
and 15% since 2007. The phenomenon was most visible in big cities such as
Barcelona or Madrid, which saw new record average prices, partially fueled by
short-term rentals to tourists.

## Banking system

Spanish private commercial banks played a central role in Spain's economic
development, benefiting from their role as the state's creditor in the 19th
century, from their ability to monetize public debt, and from state-sanctioned
oligopolistic arrangements that lasted from the beginning of the 20th century
until the late 1980s, when European rules forced a liberalization of the
sector. It has been argued that the favorable treatment received by the main
Spanish commercial banks and their close relationship to the Bank of Spain
(_Banco de España_) following the end of the Franco regime allowed for a
public-private partnership to restructure the large commercial banks into two
large banks (Santander and BBVA) with the purpose of preparing the private
institutions for international competition and external expansion once the
European banking market was integrated in 1992 Alongside this financial
mercantilism benefiting the commercial banking sector, Spanish regulators also
allowed for the vast expansion of not for profit savings banks sponsored by
regional governments who became heavily exposed to the housing mortgage and
real estate development sectors during the Spanish economic boom of 1999–2007.

Prior to 2010, the Spanish banking system had been credited as one of the most
solid of all western banking systems in coping with the ongoing worldwide
liquidity crisis, thanks to the country's conservative banking rules and
practices. Banks were required to have high capital provisions and to demand
various guarantees and securities from intending borrowers. This allowed the
banks, particularly the geographically and industrially diversified large
banks like BBVA and Santander, to weather the real estate deflation better
than expected. Indeed, Spain's large commercial banks have been able to
capitalize on their strong position to buy up distressed banking assets
elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.

Nevertheless, with the unprecedented crisis of the country's real estate
sector, smaller local savings banks ("Cajas"), had been delaying the
registering of bad loans, especially those backed by houses and land, to avoid
declaring losses. In June 2009 the Spanish government set its banking bailout
and reconstruction fund, the _Fondo de reestructuración ordenada bancaria_
(FROB), known in English as Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring. In the event,
State intervention of local savings banks due to default risk was less than
feared. On 22 May 2010, the _Banco de España_ took over "CajaSur", as part of
a national program to put the country's smaller banks on a firm financial
basis. In December 2011, the Spanish central bank, Banco de España (equivalent
of the US Federal Reserve), forcibly took over "Caja Mediterraneo", also known
as CAM, (a regional savings bank) to prevent its financial collapse.[_circular
reference_] The international accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
estimated an imbalance between CAM's assets and debts of €3,500 million, not
counting the industrial corporation. The troubled situation reached its peak
with the partial nationalization of Bankia in May 2012. By then it was
becoming clear that the mounting real estate losses of the savings banks were
undermining confidence in the country's government bonds, thus aggravating a
sovereign debt crisis.

In early June 2012, Spain requested European funding of €41 billion "to
recapitalize Spanish banks that need it". It was not a sovereign bailout in
that the funds were used only for the restructuring of the banking sector a
full-fledged bailout for an economy the size of the Spanish would have reached
ten or twelve times that amount). In return for the credit line extended by
the EMS, there were no tax or macroeconomic conditions.

As of 2017 the cost of restructuring Spain's bankrupt savings banks was
estimated to be €60.7 billion, of which nearly €41.8 billion was put up by the
state through the FROB and the rest by the banking sector. The total cost will
not be fully understood until those lenders still controlled by the State
(Bankia and BMN) are newly privatized. In this regard, by early 2017 the
Spanish government was considering a merger of both banks before privatizing
the combined bank to recoup an estimated 400 million euros of their bailout
costs. During the course of this transformation, most regional savings banks
such as the CAM, Catalunya Banc, Banco de Valencia, Novagalicia Banco, Unnim
Banc or Cajasur have since been absorbed by the bigger, more international,
Spanish banks, which imposed better management practices.

As of 2022, Spanish banks have halved their number of branches to about 20,000
in the decade since the 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis and the subsequent
international bailout in 2012. The remaining banks have reduced retail opening
hours and pushed online banking. A retired urologist with Parkinson's disease
gathered more than 600,000 signatures in an online petition "I'm Old, Not an
Idiot" asking banks and other institutions to serve all citizens, and not
discriminate against the oldest and most vulnerable members.

## Prices

Due to the lack of its own resources, Spain has to import all of its fossil
fuels. Besides, until the 2008 crisis, Spain's recent performance had shown an
inflationary tendency and an inflationary gap compared to other EMU countries,
affecting the country's overall productivity. Moreover, when Spain joined the
eurozone, it lost the recourse of resorting to competitive devaluations,
risking a permanent and cumulative loss of competitive due to inflation. In a
scenario of record oil prices by the mid-2000s this meant much added pressure
to the inflation rate. In June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high
at 5.00%.

Then, with the dramatic decrease of oil prices in the second half of 2008 plus
the manifest bursting of the real estate bubble, concerns quickly shifted over
to the risk of deflation, as Spain recorded in January 2009 its lowest
inflation rate in 40 years, followed shortly afterwards, in March 2009 by a
negative inflation rate for the first time since the gathering of these
statistics started. During the 2009−early 2016 period, apart from temporary
minor oil shocks, the Spanish economy has generally oscillated between
slightly negative to near-zero inflation rates. Analysts reckoned that this
was not synonymous with deflation, due to the fact that GDP had been growing
since 2014, domestic consumption had rebounded as well and, especially,
because core inflation remained slightly positive.

In 2017, moderate inflation between 1-2%, still below the ECB's target,
returned as the impact of cheaper fuel prices faded and economic recovery took
hold.

The global hike in prices in 2022 was less severe in Spain than it was for its
peers, ending the year with the lowest inflation rate in the eurozone, at
5.5%. Prices continued to evolve moderately in 2023, with a lower-than-
expected rate of 3.2% year-on-year announced on May 30.

## Economic strengths

A map of Spanish export destinations in 2006

Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often
expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America, Eastern Europe
and Asia. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor in Latin America, after
the United States. Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially
China and India. This early global expansion gave Spanish companies a
competitive advantage over some of Spain's competitors and European neighbors.
Another contribution to the success of Spanish firms may have to do with
booming interest toward Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa, but
also a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.

Spanish companies invested in fields like biotechnology and pharmaceuticals,
or renewable energy (Iberdrola is the world's largest renewable energy
operator), technology companies like Telefónica, Abengoa, Mondragon
Corporation, Movistar, Gamesa, Hisdesat, Indra, train manufacturers like CAF
and Talgo, global corporations such as the textile company Inditex, petroleum
companies like Repsol and infrastructure firms. Six of the ten biggest
international construction firms specialising in transport are Spanish,
lincluding Ferrovial, Acciona, ACS, OHL and FCC.

Spain is equipped with a solid banking system as well, including two global
systemically important banks, Banco Santander and BBVA.

### Infrastructure

In the 2012–13 edition of the Global Competitiveness Report Spain was listed
10th in the world in terms of first-class infrastructure. It is the 5th EU
country with best infrastructure and ahead of countries like Japan or the
United States. In particular, the country is a leader in the field of high-
speed rail, having developed the second longest network in the world (only
behind China) and leading high-speed projects with Spanish technology around
the world.

The Spanish infrastructure concession companies, lead 262 transport
infrastructure worldwide, representing 36% of the total, according to the
latest rankings compiled by the publication Public Works Financing. The top
three global occupy Spanish companies: ACS, Global Vía and Abertis, according
to the ranking of companies by number of concessions for roads, railways,
airports and ports in construction or operation in October 2012. Considering
the investment, the first world infrastructure concessionaire is Ferrovial-
Cintra, with 72,000 million euros, followed closely by ACS, with 70,200
million. Among the top ten in the world are also the Spanish Sacyr (21,500
million), FCC and Global Vía (with 19,400 million) and OHL (17,870 million).

During 2013 Spanish civil engineering companies signed contracts around the
world for a total of 40 billion euros, setting a new record for the national
industry.

The port of Valencia in Spain is the busiest seaport in the Mediterranean
basin, 5th busiest in Europe and 30th busiest in the world. There are four
other Spanish ports in the ranking of the top 125 busiest world seaports
(Algeciras, Barcelona, Las Palmas, and Bilbao); as a result, Spain is tied
with Japan in the third position of countries leading this ranking.

### Export growth

During the boom years, Spain had built up a trade deficit eventually amounting
a record equivalent to 10% of GDP (2007) and the external debt ballooned to
the equivalent of 170% of GDP, one of the highest among Western economies.
Then, during the economic downturn, Spain reduced significantly imports due to
domestic consumption shrinking while – despite the global slowdown – it has
been increasing exports and kept attracting growing numbers of tourists.
Spanish exports grew by 4.2% in 2013, the highest rate in the European Union.
As a result, after three decades of running a trade deficit Spain attained in
2013 a trade surplus. Export growth was driven by capital goods and the
automotive sector and the forecast was to reach a surplus equivalent to 2.5%
of GDP in 2014. Exports in 2014 were 34% of GDP, up from 24% in 2009. The
trade surplus attained in 2013 has been consolidated in 2014 and 2015.

Despite slightly declining exports from fellow EU countries in the same
period, Spanish exports continued to grow and in the first half of 2016 the
country beat its own record to date exporting goods for 128,041 million euros;
from the total, almost 67% were exported to other EU countries. During this
same period, from the 70 members of the World Trade Organization (whose
combined economies amount to 90% of global GDP), Spain was the country whose
exports had grown the most.

In 2016, exports of goods hit historical highs despite a global slowdown in
trade, making up for 33% of the total GDP (by comparison, exports represent
12% of GDP in the United States, 18% in Japan, 22% in China or 45% in
Germany).

In all, by 2017 foreign sales have been rising every year since 2010, with a
degree of unplanned import substitution -a rather unusual feat for Spain when
in an expansive phase- which points to structural competitive gains. According
to the most recent 2017 data, about 65% of the country's exports go to other
EU members.

## Sectors

The Spanish benchmark stock market index is the IBEX 35, which as of 2016 is
led by banking (including Banco Santander and BBVA), clothing (Inditex),
telecommunications (Telefónica) and energy (Iberdrola).

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Spain
is Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate with 2,656,178 companies followed by
Services and Retail Trade with 2,090,320 and 549,395 companies respectively.

### External trade

Traditionally until 2008, most exports and imports from Spain were held with
the countries of the European Union: France, Germany, Italy, UK and Portugal.

In recent years foreign trade has taken refuge outside the European Union.
Spain's main customers are Latin America, Asia (Japan, China, India), Africa
(Morocco, Algeria, Egypt) and the United States. Principal trading partners in
Asia are Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan. In Africa, countries producing oil
(Nigeria, Algeria, Libya) are important partners, as well as Morocco. Latin
American countries are very important trading partners, like Argentina,
Mexico, Cuba (tourism), Colombia, Brazil, Chile (food products) and Mexico,
Venezuela and Argentina (petroleum). [2] Archived 17 November 2018 at the

After the crisis that began in 2008 and the fall of the domestic market, Spain
(since 2010) has turned outwards widely increasing the export supply and
export amounts. It has diversified its traditional destinations and has grown
significantly in product sales of medium and high technology, including highly
competitive markets like the US and Asia. [3] Archived 17 November 2018 at the

### Tourism

Beach swarmed by tourists, Benidorm

During the last four decades Spain's foreign tourist industry has grown into
the second-biggest in the world. A 2015 survey by the World Economic Forum
proclaimed the country's tourism industry as the world's most competitive. The
2017 survey repeated this finding.

By 2018 the country was the second most visited country in the world,
overtaking the US and not far behind France. With 83.7 million visitors, the
country broke in 2019 its own tourism record for the tenth year in a row.

The size of the business has gone from approximately €40 billion in 2006 to
about €77 billion in 2016. In 2015 the total value of foreign and domestic
tourism came to nearly 5% of the country's GDP and provided employment for
about 2 million people.

The headquarters of the World Tourism Organization are located in Madrid.

### Automotive industry

Automotive manufacturing in Valladolid

The automotive industry is one of the largest employers in the country. In
2015 Spain was the 8th largest automobile producer country in the world and
the 2nd largest car manufacturer in Europe after Germany.

By 2016, the automotive industry was generating 8.7 percent of Spain's gross
domestic product, employing about nine percent of the manufacturing industry.
By 2008 the automobile industry was the 2nd most exported industry while in
2015 about 80% of the total production was for export.

German companies poured €4.8 billion into Spain in 2015, making the country
the second-largest destination for German foreign direct investment behind
only the U.S. The lion's share of that investment —€4 billion— went to the
country's auto industry.

### Energy

Spanish electricity usage in 2010 constituted 88% of the EU15 average (EU15:
7,409 kWh/person), and 73% of the OECD average (8,991 kWh/person).

In 2023, Spain consumed 244,686 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity, a 2.3%
decline from 2022.

Spain is one of the world leaders in renewable energies, both as a producer of
renewable energy itself and as an exporter of such technology. In 2013 it
became the first country ever in the world to have wind power as its main
source of energy.

### Agribusiness

Olive harvest in Jaén

Agribusiness has been another segment growing aggressively over the last few
years. At slightly over 40 billion euros, in 2015 agribusiness exports
accounted for 3% of GDP and over 15% of the total Spanish exports.

The boom was shaped during the 2004-2014 period, when Spain's agribusiness
exports grew by 95% led by pork, wine and olive oil. By 2012 Spain was by far
the biggest producer of olive oil in the world, accounting for 50% of the
total production worldwide. By 2013 the country became the world's leading
producer of wine; in 2014 and 2015 Spain was the world's biggest wine
exporter. However, poor marketing and low margins remain an issue, as shown by
the fact that the main importers of Spanish olive oil and wine (Italy and
France, respectively) buy bulk Spanish produce which is then bottled and sold
under Italian or French labels, often for a significant markup.

Spain is the largest producer and exporter in the EU of citrus fruit (oranges,
lemons and small citrus fruits), peaches and apricots. It is also the largest
producer and exporter of strawberries in the EU.

### Food retail

In 2020, the food distribution sector was dominated by Mercadona (24.5% market
share), followed by Carrefour (8.4%), Lidl (6.1%), DIA (5.8), Eroski (4.8),
Auchan (3.4%), regional distributors (14.3%) and other (32.7%).

### Mining

Las Cruces copper mine in Gerena

In 2019, the country was the 7th largest producer of gypsum and the 10th
world's largest producer of potash, in addition to being the 15th largest
world producer of salt.

Copper (of which the country is the second producer in Europe) is primarily
extracted in the Iberian Pyrite Belt.

The province of Granada features two mines of Celestine, making the country a
major producer of strontium concentrates.

## Mergers and acquisitions

Between 1985 and 2018 around 23,201 deals have been announced where Spanish
companies participated either as the acquirer or the target. These deals
cumulate to an overall value of 1,935 bil. USD (1,571.8 bil. EUR). Here is a
list of the top 10 deals with Spanish participation:
