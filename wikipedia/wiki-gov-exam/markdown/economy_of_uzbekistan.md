The **economy of Uzbekistan** , formerly a Soviet-style command economy, has
undergone changes that align more with a market economy. Under the
administration of Islam Karimov, currency conversion capacity was restricted,
imports were controlled and Uzbekistan's borders with neighboring Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan were sporadically closed. Since the election of
President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Uzbekistan economic and social reforms have been
implemented to boost growth and modernize the country. International Financial
Institutions, including EBRD, Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, are
supportive of the reform process and increased their presence in the country.

Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. In 2022, the Cotton
Campaign and other agencies, including the US Government, lifted all bans on
the import of cotton imposed due to international human rights concerns.

Uzbekistan is also a big producer of gold, with the largest open-pit gold mine
in the world. The country has substantial deposits of silver, strategic
minerals, gas, and oil.

Since 2016, there have been significant economic reforms in Uzbekistan. The
country liberalised the currency in 2017, allowing freer flows of foreign
currency and allowing the import and export of goods, and the path to foreign
investment. 2019 tax reforms also allowed company consolidation, tax
simplification and the professionalisation of the Private sector. The
Government is also committed to privatisation of State Owned Enterprises
(SOEs), with the domestic IPO of UzAuto predicted in 2022.

The Uzbekistan Economic Forum run by the Ministry of Finance brings together
IFIs, businesses, government officials and other stakeholders on an annual
basis. The first iteration was in Tashkent, and the Uzbekistan Economic Forum
II took place in Samarkand. In December 2022, the Uzbek Government received a
loan from the World Bank of almost US$1bn to "implement strategic reforms".
Today, the volume of GDP of Uzbekistan has reached 146 billion dollars.

## GDP and employment

This is a chart depicting the trend of the gross domestic product in
Uzbekistan in constant prices of 1995, estimated by the International Monetary
Fund with figures in millions of soum. The chart also shows the consumer price
index(CPI) as a measure of inflation from the same source and the end-of-year
U.S. dollar exchange rate from the Central Bank of the Uzbekistan database.
For purchasing power parity comparisons in 2006, the U.S. dollar is exchanged
at 340 som.

Year | GDP (constant prices) | US Dollar Exchange | CPI (2000=100)   
---|---|---|---  
1992 | 330,042 | 1 soum | 0.07   
1995 | 302,790 | 36 soum | 20   
2000 | 356,325 | 325 soum | 100   
2003 | 402,361 | 980 soum | 166   
2006 | 497,525 | 1,240 soum | 226   
Uzbekistan: growth of GDP in constant prices 1992–2008

Uzbekistan's GDP, like that of all CIS countries, declined during the first
years of transition and then recovered after 1995, as the cumulative effect of
policy reforms began to be felt. It showed robust growth, rising by 4% per
year between 1998 and 2003, and accelerating thereafter to 7–8% per year. In
2011 the growth rate rose to 9%.

Given the growing economy, the total number of people employed rose from 8.5
million in 1995 to 13.5 million in 2011. This increase of nearly 25% in the
labor force lagged behind the increase in GDP during the same period (64%, see
chart), which implied a significant increase in labor productivity. Official
unemployment is low: less than 30,000 job seekers were registered in
government labor exchanges in 2005–2006 (0.3% of the labor force).
Underemployment, on the other hand, is quite high, especially in agriculture,
which accounts for fully 28% of all employed, many working part-time on small
household plots.

The minimum wage, public-sector wages, and old-age pensions are raised twice a
year to ensure that base income is not eroded by inflation. Although no
statistics are published on average wages in Uzbekistan, pensions as a proxy
for the average wage increased significantly between 1995 and 2006, both in
real terms and in U.S. dollars. The monthly old-age pension increased in real
(CPI-adjusted) soums by almost a factor of 5 between 1995 and 2006. The
monthly pension in U.S. dollars was around $20–$25 until 2000, then dropped to
$15–$20 between 2001 and 2004, and now is $64. The minimum wage was raised to
$34.31 in November 2011. Assuming that the average wages in the country are at
a level of 3–4 times the monthly pension, we estimate the wages in 2006 at
$100–$250 per month, or $3–$8 per day.

According to the forecast by the Asian Development Bank, the GDP in Uzbekistan
in 2009 was expected to grow by 7%. Meanwhile, in 2010 the Uzbekistan GDP
growth is predicted at 6,5%.

## Work force and vocational training

Tashkent City Park

Literacy in Uzbekistan is almost universal, but in order to meet labor force
needs, hundreds of students are sent to the United States, Europe, and Japan
for university degrees, after which they commit to working for the government
for 5 years. About 60% of students who study abroad find employment with
foreign companies upon completing their degrees despite their commitment to
work for the government.

In addition, Uzbekistan subsidizes studies for students at Westminster
International University in Tashkent—one of the few Western-style institutions
in Uzbekistan. In 2002, the government "Istedod" Foundation (formerly as
"Umid" Foundation) paid for 98 out of 155 students studying at Westminster.
For the following academic year, Westminster admitted 360 students, with
Istedod paying for 160 students. Tuition is $5,200 per academic year.

In 2008 Management Development Institute of Singapore at Tashkent opened to
provide high quality education with international degrees. Tuition fee was
$5000 in 2012.

In 2009 Turin Polytechnik University was opened. It is the only university in
Central Asia that prepares high quality employees for industries. With the
closing or downsizing of many foreign firms, it is relatively easy to find
qualified employees, though salaries are very low by Western standards. Salary
caps, which the government implements in an apparent attempt to prevent firms
from circumventing restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks, prevent many
foreign firms from paying their workers as much as they would like. Labor
market regulations in Uzbekistan are similar to those of the Soviet Union,
with all rights guaranteed but some rights unobserved. Unemployment is a
growing problem, and the number of people looking for jobs in Russia,
Kazakhstan, and Southeast Asia is increasing each year. Uzbekistan's Ministry
of Labor does not publish information on Uzbek citizens working abroad, but
Russia's Federal Migration Service reports 2.5 million Uzbek migrant workers
in Russia. There are also indications of up to 1 million Uzbek migrants
working illegally in Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan's migrant workers may thus be
around 3.5–4 million people, or a staggering 25% of its labor force of 14.8
million. The U.S. Department of State also estimates that between three and
five million Uzbek citizens of working age live outside Uzbekistan.

After acknowledging the need for more higher education to support labor market
needs, new programs were opened and cooperation commenced with foreign
universities. Moreover, private higher education providers started to emerge
on the market to provide students with necessary skills, knowledge and
competencies required on the labor market. One of the private universities in
Tashkent TEAM University aims at development of skills necessary for starting
entrepreneurial activities, thus contributing to development of businesses and
private enterprises.

## Prices and monetary policy

Uzbekistan experienced galloping inflation of around 1000% per year
immediately after independence (1992–1994). Stabilization efforts implemented
with active guidance from the International Monetary Fund rapidly paid off, as
inflation rates were brought down to 50% in 1997 and then to 22% in 2002.
Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.

The severe inflationary pressures that characterized the early years of
independence inevitably led to a dramatic depreciation of the national
currency. The exchange rate of Uzbekistan's first currency, the "notional"
rouble inherited from the Soviet period and its successor, the transient
"coupon soum" introduced in November 1993 in a ratio of 1:1 to the rouble,
went up from 100 roubles/US$ in the early 1992 to 3,627 roubles (or coupon
soum) in mid-April 1994. On July 1, 1994, the "coupon soum" was replaced with
the permanent new Uzbek soum (UZS) in a ratio of 1000:1, and the starting
exchange rate for the new national currency was set at 7 soum/US$, implying an
almost two-fold depreciation since mid-April. Within the first six months,
between July and December 1994, the national currency depreciated further to
25 soum/US$ and continued depreciating at a fast clip until December 2002,
when the exchange rate had reached 969 soum/US$, i.e., 138 times the starting
exchange rate eight and a half years earlier or nearly 10,000 times the
exchange rate in early 1992, soon after the declaration of independence. Then
the depreciation of the soum virtually stopped in response to the government's
stabilization program, which at the same time dramatically reduced the
inflation rates. During the four years that followed (2003–2007) the exchange
rate of the soum to the US dollar increased only by a factor of 1.33, from 969
soum to around 1,865 soum in May 2012.

From 1996 until the spring of 2003, the official and so-called "commercial"
exchange rate – both set administratively by the Central Bank – were highly
overvalued. Many businesses and individuals were unable to buy dollars legally
at these "low" rates, so a widespread black market developed to meet hard
currency demand. The spread between the official exchange rate and the curb
rate widened especially after the 1998 Russian financial crisis: at the end of
1999 the curb rate stood at 550 soum/US$ compared with the official rate of
140 soum/US$, a gap by nearly a factor of 4 (up from a factor of "only" 2 in
1997 and the first half of 1998). By mid-2003, the government's stabilization
and liberalization efforts had reduced the gap between the black market,
official, and commercial rates to approximately 8% and it quickly disappeared
as the soum was made convertible after October 2003. Today, four foreign
currencies—the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen—are
freely exchanged in commercial booths all around the cities, while other
currencies, including the Russian rouble and the Kazakh tenge, are bought and
sold by individual ("black market") money changers, who are allowed to operate
openly without harassment. The foreign exchange regime since October 2003 is
characterized as "controlled floating rate". Liberalization of the trade
regime remains a prerequisite for Uzbekistan to proceed to an IMF-financed
program. In 2012, "black market" rate is again significantly higher than
official rate, 2,850 soum/US$ vs. 1,865 soum/US$ (as of mid-June 2011). This
curb rate is often referred to as 'bazar rate', because money changers operate
at or near 'bazars' – large farmer markets.

Tax collection rates remained high, due to the use of the banking system by
the government as a collection agency. Technical assistance from the World
Bank, Office of Technical Assistance at the U.S. Treasury Department, and UNDP
is being provided in reforming the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance into
institutions capable of conducting market-oriented fiscal and monetary policy.

## Agriculture

In 2018, Uzbekistan produced:

  * 5.4 million tonnes of wheat;
  * 2.9 million tons of potato;
  * 2.2 million tons of cotton (8th largest producer in the world);
  * 2.2 million tons of tomato (14th largest producer in the world);
  * 2.1 million tonnes of carrot (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind China);
  * 1.8 million tons of watermelon (8th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.5 million tons of grape (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.4 million tons of onion (15th largest producer in the world);
  * 1.1 million tons of apple (14th largest producer in the world);
  * 857 thousand tons of cucumber (7th largest producer in the world);
  * 743 thousand tons of cabbage;
  * 493 thousand tons of apricot (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind Turkey);
  * 413 thousand tons of maize;
  * 254 thousand tons of garlic;
  * 221 thousand tons of rice;
  * 172 thousand tons of cherry;
  * 161 thousand tons of peach;
  * 134 thousand tons of plum (17th largest producer in the world);

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

At the end of 2013, the government announced through the Central Bank of the
Republic of Uzbekistan that it predicted agriculture as playing a major
component of the country's economic development in the future. Agriculture in
Uzbekistan employs 28% of labor force and contributes 24% of GDP (2006 data).
Another 8% of GDP is from processing of domestic agricultural output. Cotton,
once Uzbekistan's star cash earner, has lost much its luster since
independence as wheat began to gain prominence from considerations of food
security for the rapidly growing population. Areas cropped to cotton were
reduced by more than 25% from 2 million hectares in 1990 to less than 1.5
million hectares in 2006, while wheat cultivation jumped 60% from around 1
million hectares in 1990 to 1.6 million hectares in 2006. Cotton production
dropped from 3 million tons annually in the pre-independence decade to around
1.2 million tons since 1995, but even at these reduced levels Uzbekistan
produces 3 times as much cotton as all the other Central Asian countries and
Azerbaijan combined. Cotton exports tumbled from highs of around 45% of
Uzbekistan's total exports in the early 1990s to 17% in 2006. Uzbekistan is
the largest producer of jute in West Asia and it also produces significant
quantities of silk (Uzbek ikat), fruit, and vegetables, with food products
contributing nearly 8% of total exports in 2006. Virtually all agriculture
requires irrigation, but because of budgetary constraints there has been
practically no expansion of irrigated area since independence: it remains
static at 4.2 million hectares, the level reached by 1990 after rapid growth
during the Soviet period.

Government intervention in agriculture is reflected in the persistence of
state orders for the two main cash crops, cotton and wheat. Farmers receive
binding directives on the area to be cropped to these commodities and are
obliged to surrender their harvest to designated marketers at state-fixed
prices. The incomes of farmers and agricultural workers are substantially
lower than the national average because the government pays them less than the
world prices for their cotton and wheat, using the difference to subsidize
capital intensive industrial concerns, such as factories producing
automobiles, airplanes, and tractors. Consequently, many farmers focus on
production of fruits and vegetables on their small household plots, because
the prices of these commodities are determined by supply and demand, not by
government decrees. Farmers also resort to smuggling cotton and especially
wheat across the border with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to obtain
higher prices.

The government's pricing for the main cash crops, cotton and wheat, is
apparently responsible for the exceptionally rapid growth of the cattle herd
in recent years, as the prices of milk and meat, like those of fruits and
vegetables, are also determined by market forces. The number of cattle
increased from 4 million head in 1990 to 7 million head in 2006, and virtually
all these animals are maintained by rural families with just 2–3 head per
household. Sales of own-produced milk, meat, and vegetables in town markets
are an important source for augmenting rural family incomes.

The Soviet practice of using "volunteer labor" to help gathering the cotton
harvest continues in Uzbekistan where schoolchildren, university students,
medical professionals, and state employees are driven en masse out to the
fields every year. A recent article posted by a domestic news agency
(admittedly with strong anti-government leanings) describes Uzbekistan's
cotton as "riches gathered by the hands of hungry children".

## Natural resources and energy

In 2019, the country was the 5th largest world producer of uranium; 12th
largest world producer of gold; 7th largest world producer of rhenium; 12th
largest world producer of molybdenum; 21st largest world producer of
phosphate, and the 19th largest world producer of graphite

Minerals and mining are important economic sectors. Gold and cotton are major
foreign exchange earners, unofficially estimated at 20% of total exports.
Uzbekistan is the world's seventh-largest gold producer, mining about 80 tons
per year, and holds the fourth-largest reserves in the world. Uzbekistan has
an abundance of natural gas, used both for domestic consumption and export;
oil used for domestic consumption; and significant reserves of copper, lead,
zinc, tungsten, and uranium. Energy use is generally high since the controlled
prices do not stimulate consumers to conserve energy. Uzbekistan was a partner
country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which focused on enhancing energy
security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU
internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development,
and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.

The country's largest steel manufacturer is Uzmetkombinat. The company planned
an IPO in 2023.

## External trade and investment

---|---  
  
Since the 2017 liberalisation of the foreign exchange market, Uzbekistan has
seen rapid growth in exports. Traditional export products such as gas and
cotton are now kept domestically for processing. They have been replaced by a
vast growth in exports in areas such as fruit, textiles and home appliances.
In recent years textile export has doubled in revenue to almost US$3bn worth
of goods exports. Home appliance manufacturer Artel has seen exports rise from
$5.6m in 2017, to around $100m in 2021.

Before this, the system of multiple exchange rates combined with the highly
regulated trade regime caused both imports and exports to drop each from about
US$4.5 billion in 1996 to less than US$3 billion in 2002. The success of
stabilization and currency liberalization in 2003 has led to significant
increases in exports and imports in recent years, although imports have
increased much less rapidly: while exports had more than doubled to US$15.5 by
2011, imports had risen to US$6.5 billion only, reflecting the impact of the
government's import substitution policies designed to maintain hard currency
reserves. Draconian tariffs, sporadic border closures, and border crossing
"fees" have a negative effect on legal imports of both consumer products and
capital equipment.

Uzbekistan is a member of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian
Development Bank, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It has
observer status at the World Trade Organization, is a member of the World
Intellectual Property Organization, and is a signatory to the _Convention on
Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other
States_ , the _Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property_ ,
the _Madrid Agreement on Trademarks Protection_, and the _Patent Cooperation
Treaty_. In 2002, Uzbekistan was again placed on the special "301" Watch List
for lack of intellectual copyright protection.

Daewoo Gentra is currently a flagship of UzDaewooAuto.

Until 2017, according to EBRD transition indicators, Uzbekistan's investment
climate remains among the least favorable in the CIS, with only Belarus and
Turkmenistan ranking lower. The unfavorable investment climate has caused
foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that
Uzbekistan has the lowest level of foreign direct investment per capita in the
CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500
million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment,
and currency convertibility problems, numerous international investors have
left the country or are considering leaving. In 2005, the Central Bank has
revoked the license of the nascent Biznes Bank citing unspecified violations
of local currency exchange rules. The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy
procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month. No
interest was accrued during that two-month period. In 2006, the Government of
Uzbekistan forced out Newmont Mining Corporation (at the time the largest U.S.
investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the Muruntau gold mine.
Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely
affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted
the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned
telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to
another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of GM, is the only known
U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years. It recently signed
a joint-venture agreement with UzDaewooAuto to assemble Korean-manufactured
cars for export and domestic sale. Other large U.S. investors in Uzbekistan
include Case IH, manufacturing and servicing cotton harvesters and tractors;
Coca-Cola, with bottling plants in Tashkent, Namangan, and Samarkand; Texaco,
producing lubricants for sale in the Uzbek market; and Baker Hughes, in oil
and gas development.

In 2024, Uzbekistan’s external debt reached $64.1 billion, or 55.7% of GDP, up
from 51.9% in 2023. This included both public and private liabilities, though
much of the private sector; particularly banks and industrial enterprises;
remained state-owned. Government debt rose to $33.9 billion (29.5% of GDP),
while corporate external debt reached $30.2 billion (26.2%). The government
continued to control about 65% of the banking sector and held stakes in major
firms like UzAuto Motors and Uzbekneftegaz. Public debt was projected to rise
to $45.1 billion (36.7% of GDP) by the end of 2025.

In 2025, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a law on Uzbekistan's accession
to the Agreement Establishing the Eurasian Development Bank (EADB). Uzbekistan
will become the seventh member of the Bank and the third largest shareholder
with a 10% equity stake.

## Banking

Uzbekistan's banks have demonstrated reasonably stable performance in a
largely state-dominated local economy. Sector stability is currently supported
by rapid economic growth, low exposure to external financial markets and the
strong external and fiscal position of the sovereign. However, the sector
remains vulnerable to possible economic shocks due to weak corporate
governance and risk management, fast recent asset growth, significant directed
lending and acquisitions of problem assets. Banks’ foreign currency
obligations, specifically those arising from trade finance, are particularly
vulnerable due to existing foreign exchange constraints.

According to Fitch Ratings, there are notable risks of asset quality
deterioration in case of a reversal in economic trends. The funding base is
mainly short-term, largely sourced from corporate current accounts, while
retail funds account for only a small 25% of total deposits. Longer-term
funding is provided by the Ministry of Finance and other state agencies, which
comprise a notable proportion of sector liabilities. Foreign funding is small,
estimated at 10% of the total liabilities, and plans for further borrowings
are moderate. Liquidity management is constrained be the lack of deep capital
markets, and banks generally tend to hold substantial cash reserves on their
balance sheets. The quality of capital is sometimes compromised by less
conservative regulatory requirements for recognition of credit impairment and
by investments in non-core assets.

## Retail

Uzbekistan's retail sector remains dominated by traditional markets, known as
_bozorlar_ , where individual vendors sell food, housewares, clothing, and
other consumer goods. But the country's retail sector is rapidly modernizing.
The construction of modern supermarkets and malls has accelerated in recent
years. The country's retail market was estimated at $17 billion in 2017 and
rising incomes, population growth, and a move from informal to formal retail
are expected to drive continued expansion of the sector. Major supermarket
chains include local players Korzinka.uz and Makro (Uzbekistan) and the French
multinational chain Carrefour, which will open its first store in Uzbekistan
in 2021. The country's first modern shopping malls are located in Tashkent,
and include the Samarkand Darvoza and Compass developments. The sector has
also seen growth in online retail. In 2021, Korzinka acquired a US$40m stake
in Anglesey Food, the Singapore mother entity of Korzinka. In 2021, the
company also signed a signed $12 million in debt financing to promote food
security and sustain the livelihoods of more than 5,000 employees and 1,200
farm workers in Uzbekistan.

## Tourism

Silk road route's three important cities are located in Uzbekistan, namely
Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand. There are numerous well connected tourist
destinations in Uzbekistan. There are five UNESCO World Heritage Sites in
Uzbekistan and 30 are on tentative list.

## Controversy

According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP),
Vlast, and iStories, after February 24, 2022, Uzbekistan significantly
increased its exports of cotton pulp and nitrocellulose, key components for
making explosives and gunpowder, to Russia. According to Ekonomichna Pravda,
at least two large Uzbek exporters have been working with Russian military-
industrial complex enterprises. Documents from the Russian Federal Tax Service
confirm that at least three Russian companies – Bina Group, Khimtrade, and
Lenakhim - sold imported cotton pulp to military plants in Russia. Among them:
Kazan Powder Plant (a strategic defense-industrial enterprise that produces
gunpowder and charges for various types of weapons, subject to US sanctions),
Tambov Powder Plant (a defense-industrial enterprise that produces ammunition
and special chemicals, It is subject to US and Ukrainian sanctions), Perm
Powder Plant (an enterprise involved in the production of Topol-M and Bulava
intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as Kornet ATGMs and Grad and
Smerch multiple rocket launchers. It is under Ukrainian sanctions).
