Zimbabwean exports in 2006

The **economy of Zimbabwe** is a gold standard based economy. Zimbabwe has a
$44 billion dollar informal economy in PPP terms which translates to 64.1% of
the total economy. Agriculture and mining largely contribute to exports. The
economy is estimated to be at $73 billion at the end of 2023.

The country has reserves of metallurgical-grade chromite. Other commercial
mineral deposits include coal, diamonds, lithium, asbestos, copper, nickel,
gold, platinum and iron ore.

During Zimbabwe's colonial period, food insecurity was a significant issue,
exacerbated by forced relocation to "native reserves" and the destruction of
stored food by colonial forces. These actions created dependence on the
colonial authorities and hampered food production. Natural disasters like
drought, locust invasions, and animal diseases further compounded the problem.
After tumultuous&controversial Land Reform in 2000s Zimbabwe Agriculture has
seen a comeback being self sufficient again with wheat and record high tobacco
production and export.

## The sweeping impact of land reform

In 2000, Zimbabwe launched a controversial land reform that, over the next
decade, would seize about 6,000 large, white-owned farms and convert them into
over 168,000 black-owned farms. Many of the new occupants, mainly consisting
of landless black citizens and several prominent members of the ruling ZANU-PF
administration, were inexperienced or uninterested in farming, thereby failing
to retain the labour-intensive, highly efficient management of previous
landowners, triggering severe export losses.

This policy of widespread seizure of private land and property spooked
international investors and negatively affected market confidence. The US and
other nations slapped sanctions on government officials due to the human
rights abuses attributable to the land reform. Many sanctions continue to this
day.

In this time, between 1999–2008, Zimbabwe's GDP shrunk by nearly half — the
most severe downturn in a country not at war in recorded history.

## Hyperinflation and currency changes

Between 2003–2006, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began printing money at an
extreme rate, causing inflation to spike by a factor of 1,000. By the middle
of 2008, Zimbabwe hit a breaking point. Inflation hit 89.7 sextillion percent
— a $100 trillion bill didn't even cover a bus fare.

Shortly afterwards, the government introduced a multi-currency system, making
U.S. dollars, and other currencies legal tender. The Zimbabwe dollar, now
nearly worthless, disappeared from circulation.

After a period of relative economic stability, the government reintroduced
local currency again in 2019, and quickly faced challenges in maintaining its
value. At the time of its reintroduction, one loaf of bread cost between 2 and
3 Zimbabwean dollars. By 2024, the price had risen to 24,000 Zimbabwean
dollars, roughly equivalent to 1 United States dollar. Although the U.S.
dollar remains officially tolerated, many vendors are reluctant to accept
payments in local currency due to its instability.

In April 2024, the government launched a new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), to
replace the Zimbabwean dollar. Backed by the country's reserves of foreign
currency and precious metals, primarily gold, the new currency aimed to curb
inflation by preventing excessive money printing and to restore price
stability.

## Current economic conditions

Government spending is 29.7% of GDP. State enterprises are strongly
subsidized. Taxes and tariffs are high, and state regulation is costly to
companies. Starting or closing a business is slow and costly. Due to the
regulations of the labour market, hiring and terminating workers is a lengthy
process. By 2008, an unofficial estimate of unemployment had risen to 94%.

As of 2023, Zimbabwe's official unemployment rate stood at 9.3%, though the
vast majority of workers are in the informal sector, made up of low-paying,
temporary and precarious jobs.

A 2014 report by the Africa Progress Panel found that, of all the African
countries examined when determining how many years it would take to double per
capita GDP, Zimbabwe fared the worst, and that at its current rate of
development it would take 190 years for the country to double its per capita
GDP. Uncertainty around the indigenisation programme (compulsory acquisition),
the perceived lack of a free press, the possibility of abandoning the US
dollar as official currency, and political uncertainty following the end of
the government of national unity with the MDC as well as power struggles
within ZANU-PF have increased concerns that the country's economic situation
could further deteriorate.

In September 2016 the finance minister identified "low levels of production
and the attendant trade gap, insignificant foreign direct investment and lack
of access to international finance due to huge arrears" as significant causes
for the poor performance of the economy.

Zimbabwe came 140 out of 190 ease of doing business report released by the
World Bank Group. They were ranked high for ability to get credit (ranked 85)
and protecting minority investors (ranked 95).

## Infrastructure and resources

### Transportation

Zimbabwe's internal transportation and electrical power networks are adequate;
nevertheless, maintenance has been ignored for several years. Zimbabwe is
crossed by two trans-African automobile routes: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway
and the Beira-Lobito Highway. Poorly paved highways connect the major urban
and industrial areas, while rail lines controlled by the National Railways of
Zimbabwe connect Zimbabwe to a vast central African railroad network that
connects it to all of its neighbors.

### Energy

The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority is responsible for providing the
country with electrical energy. Zimbabwe has two larger facilities for the
generation of electrical power, the Kariba Dam (owned together with Zambia)
and since 1983 by large Hwange Thermal Power Station adjacent to the Hwange
coal field. However, total generation capacity does not meet the demand,
leading to rolling blackouts. The Hwange station is not capable of using its
full capacity due to old age and maintenance neglect. In 2006, crumbling
infrastructure and lack of spare parts for generators and coal mining lead to
Zimbabwe importing 40% of its power, including 100 megawatts from the
Democratic Republic of Congo, 200 megawatts from Mozambique, up to 450 from
South Africa, and 300 megawatts from Zambia. In May 2010 the country's
generation power was an estimated 940MW against a peak demand of 2500MW. Use
of local small scale generators is widespread.

### Telephone

New telephone lines used to be difficult to obtain. With TelOne, however,
Zimbabwe has only one fixed line service provider. Cellular phone networks are
an alternative. Principal mobile phone operators are Telecel, Net*One, and
Econet.

### Agriculture

Agriculture in Zimbabwe can be divided into two parts: commercial farming of
crops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, peanuts and various fruits, and
subsistence farming with staple crops, such as maize or wheat.

Commercial farming was almost exclusively in the hands of the white minority
until the controversial land redistribution program began in 2000. Land in
Zimbabwe was forcibly seized from white farmers and redistributed to black
settlers, justified by Mugabe on the grounds that it was meant to rectify
inequalities left over from colonialism. The new owners did not have land
titles, and as such did not have the collateral necessary to access bank
loans. The small-scale farmers also did not have experience with commercial-
scale agriculture.

After land redistribution, much of Zimbabwe's land went fallow, and
agricultural production decreased steeply. The University of Zimbabwe
estimated in 2008 that between 2000 and 2007 agricultural production decreased
by 51%. Production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's main export crop, decreased by 79%
from 2000 to 2008.

Tobacco production recovered after 2008 thanks to the contract system of
agriculture and growing Chinese demand. International tobacco companies, such
as British American Tobacco and China Tobacco, supplied farmers with
agricultural inputs, equipment, and loans, and supervised them in growing
tobacco. By 2018, tobacco production had recovered to 258 million kg, the
second largest crop on record. Instead of large white-owned farms selling
mostly to European and American companies, Zimbabwe's tobacco sector now
consists of small black-owned farms exporting over half of the crop to China.
Tobacco farming accounted for 11% of Zimbabwe's GDP in 2017, and 3 million of
its 16 million people depended on tobacco for their livelihood.

Land reform has found considerable support in Africa and a few supporters
among African-American activists, but Jesse Jackson commented during a visit
to South Africa in June 2006, "Land redistribution has long been a noble goal
to achieve but it has to be done in a way that minimises trauma. The process
has to attract investors rather than scare them away. What is required in
Zimbabwe is democratic rule, democracy is lacking in the country and that is
the major cause of this economic meltdown."

Zimbabwe produced, in 2018:

  * 3,3 million tons of sugarcane;
  * 730 thousand tons of maize;
  * 256 thousand tons of cassava;
  * 191 thousand tons of vegetable;
  * 132 thousand tons of tobacco (6th largest producer in the world);
  * 106 thousand tons of banana;
  * 96 thousand tons of orange;
  * 90 thousand tons of soy;
  * 80 thousand tons of sorghum;
  * 60 thousand tons of potato;
  * 55 thousand tons of barley;
  * 42 thousand tons of peanut;
  * 38 thousand tons of cotton;

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

### Mining sector

As other southern African countries, Zimbabwean soil is rich in raw materials,
namely platinum, coal, iron ore, and gold. Recently, diamonds have also been
found in considerable deposits. Copper, chromite and nickel deposits also
exist, though in lesser amounts. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in
2006 are thought to be among the richest in the world.

In March 2011, the government of Zimbabwe implemented laws which required
local ownership of mining companies; following this news, there were falls in
the share prices of companies with mines in Zimbabwe.

Gold production year  | kg   
---|---  
1998  | 27,114   
2007  | 7,017   
2015  | 18,400   
  
Various NGOs reported that the diamond sector in Zimbabwe is rife with
corruption; a November 2012 report by NGO Reap What You Sow revealed a huge
lack of transparency of diamond revenues and asserted that Zimbabwe's elite
are benefiting from the country's diamonds. This followed former South African
President Thabo Mbeki’s warning days earlier that Zimbabwe needed to stop its
"predatory elite" from colluding with mining companies for their own benefit.
Also in that month, the Associated Press reported that at least $2 billion
worth of diamonds had been stolen from Zimbabwe's eastern diamond fields and
had enriched Mugabe's ruling circle and various connected gem dealers and
criminals.

In January 2013, Zimbabwe's mineral exports totalled $1.8 billion.

As of October 2014, Metallon Corporation was Zimbabwe's largest gold miner.
The group is controlled by its Chairman Mzi Khumalo.

In 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of platinum and the
6th largest world producer of lithium. In the production of gold, in 2017 the
country produced 23.9 tons.

### Education

The state of education in Zimbabwe affects the development of the economy
while the state of the economy can affect access and quality of teachers and
education. Zimbabwe has one of Africa's highest literacy rates at over 90%.
The crisis since 2000 has, however, diminished these achievements because of a
lack of resources and the exodus of teachers and specialists (e.g. doctors,
scientists, engineers) to other countries. Also, the start of the new
curriculum in primary and secondary sections has affected the state of the
once strong education sector.

## Science and technology

Zimbabwe's _Second Science and Technology Policy_ (2012) cites sectorial
policies with a focus on biotechnology, information and communication
technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge
systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent
environmental challenges. The policy makes provisions for establishing a
National Nanotechnology Programme.

Zimbabwe has a _National Biotechnology Policy_ which dates from 2005. Despite
poor infrastructure and a lack of both human and financial resources,
biotechnology research is better established in Zimbabwe than in most sub-
Saharan countries, even if it tends to use primarily traditional techniques.

The _Second Science and Technology Policy_ asserts the government commitment
to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at
least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and
technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time
to studying science subjects.

## History

Zimbabwe's GDP annual percentage growth rate from 1980 to 2010.

In 1997, Zimbabwe's economic decline began to visibly take place. It began
with the crash of the stock market on November 14, 1997. Civil society groups
began to agitate for their rights as these had been eroded under ESAP. In 1997
alone, 232 strikes were recorded, the largest number in any year since
independence (Kanyenze 2004). During the first half of 1997, the war veterans
organized themselves and demonstrations that were initially ignored by the
government. As the intensity of the strikes grew, the government was forced to
pay the war veterans a once-off gratuity of ZWD $50,000 by December 31, 1997,
and a monthly pension of US$2,000 beginning January 1998 (Kanyenze 2004). To
raise money for this unbudgeted expense, the government tried to introduce a
‘war veterans’ levy,’ but they faced much opposition from the labor force and
had to effectively borrow money to meet these obligations. Following the
massive depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar in 1997, the cost of
agricultural inputs soared, undermining the viability of the producers who in
turn demanded that the producer price of maize (corn) be raised. Millers then
hiked prices by 24 percent in January 1998 by 24 percent and the consequent
increase in the price of maize meal triggered nation-wide riots during the
last month. The government intervened by introducing price controls on all
basic commodities (Kanyenze 2004). Multiple interventionist moves were
undertaken to try to reverse some of the negative effects of the Structural
Adjustment Programs and to try to strengthen the private sector that was
suffering from decreasing output and increasing competition from cheap
imported products. Some of the most detrimental policies that followed
include:

### 1980–2000

At the time of independence, annual inflation was 5.4 percent and month-to-
month inflation was 0.5 percent. Currency of Z$2, Z$5, Z$10 and Z$20
denominations were released. Roughly 95 percent of transactions used the
Zimbabwean dollar. Following the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979,
the transition to majority rule in early 1980, and the lifting of sanctions,
Zimbabwe enjoyed a brisk economic recovery. Real growth for 1980–1981 exceeded
20%. However, depressed foreign demand for the country's mineral exports and
the onset of a drought cut sharply into the growth rate in 1982, 1983, and
1984. In 1985, the economy rebounded strongly due to a 30% jump in
agricultural production. However, it slumped in 1986 to a zero growth rate and
registered a negative of about 3% in 1987, primarily because of drought and
the foreign exchange crisis faced by the country.[_citation needed_]
Zimbabwe's GDP grew on average by about 4.5% between 1980 and 1990.

In 1992, a World Bank study indicated that more than 500 health centres had
been built since 1980. The percentage of children vaccinated increased from
25% in 1980 to 67% in 1988, and life expectancy increased from 55 to 59 years.
Enrolment increased by 232 percent one year after primary education was made
free, and secondary school enrolment increased by 33 percent in two years.
These social policies lead to an increase in the debt ratio. Several laws were
passed in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce wage gaps. However, the gaps
remained considerable. In 1988, the law gave women, at least in theory, the
same rights as men. Previously, they could only take a few personal
initiatives without the consent of their father or husband.

The government started crumbling when a bonus to independence war veterans was
announced in 1997 (which was equal to 3 percent of GDP) followed by unexpected
spending due to Zimbabwe's involvement in the Second Congo War in 1998. In
1999, the country also witnessed a drought which further weakened the economy,
ultimately leading to the country's bankruptcy in the next decade. In the same
year, 1999, Zimbabwe experienced its first defaults on its IMF, World Bank,
and African Development Bank debts in addition to debts taken out with Western
lenders.

### 2000–2009

In recent years, there has been economic hardship in Zimbabwe. Multiple
western countries argue that the Government of Zimbabwe's land reform program,
recurrent interference with, and intimidation of the judiciary, as well as
maintenance of unrealistic price controls and exchange rates has led to a
sharp drop in investor confidence.

Between 2000 and December 2007, the national economy contracted by as much as
40%; inflation vaulted to over 66,000%, and there were persistent shortages of
hard currency, fuel, medicine, and food. GDP per capita dropped by 40%,
agricultural output dropped by 51% and industrial production dropped by 47%.
[_citation needed_]

The Mugabe Government attribute Zimbabwe's economic difficulties to sanctions
imposed by the Western powers. It has been argued[_by whom?_] that the
sanctions imposed by Britain, the US, and the EU have been designed to cripple
the economy and the conditions of the Zimbabwean people in an attempt to
overthrow President Mugabe's government. These countries on their side argue
that the sanctions are targeted against Mugabe and his inner circle and some
of the companies they own. Critics[_who?_] point to the so-called "Zimbabwe
Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001", signed by Bush, as an effort to
undermine Zimbabwe's economy. Soon after the bill was signed, IMF cut off its
resources to Zimbabwe. Financial institutions began withdrawing support for
Zimbabwe. Terms of the sanctions made it such that all economic assistance
would be structured in support of "democratisation, respect for human rights
and the rule of law." The EU terminated its support for all projects in
Zimbabwe. Because of the sanctions and US and EU foreign policy, none of
Zimbabwe's debts have been cancelled as in other countries.

Other observers also point out how the asset freezes by the EU on people or
companies associated with Zimbabwe's Government have had significant economic
and social costs to Zimbabwe.

As of February 2004, Zimbabwe's foreign debt repayments ceased, resulting in
compulsory suspension from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This, and
the United Nations World Food Programme stopping its food aid due to
insufficient donations from the world community, has forced the government
into borrowing from local sources.

#### Hyperinflation (2004–2009)

Official, black market, and OMIR exchange rates Jan 1, 2001 to Feb 2, 2009.
Note the logarithmic scale.

Zimbabwe began experiencing severe foreign exchange shortages, exacerbated by
the difference between the official rate and the black market rate in 2000. In
2004 a system of auctioning scarce foreign currency for importers was
introduced, which temporarily led to a slight reduction in the foreign
currency crisis, but by mid-2005 foreign currency shortages were once again
severe. The currency was devalued by the central bank twice, first to 9,000 to
the US$, and then to 17,500 to the US$ on 20 July 2005, but at that date it
was reported that that was only half the rate available on the black market.

In July 2005 Zimbabwe was reported to be appealing to the South African
government for US$1 billion of emergency loans, but despite regular rumours
that the idea was being discussed no substantial financial support has been
publicly reported.

In December 2005 Zimbabwe made a mystery loan repayment of US$120 million to
the International Monetary Fund due to expulsion threat from IMF.

The official Zimbabwean dollar exchange rate had been frozen at Z$101,196 per
U.S. dollar since early 2006, but as of 27 July 2006 the parallel (black
market) rate has reached Z$550,000 per U.S. dollar. By comparison, 10 years
earlier, the rate of exchange was only Z$9.13 per USD.

In August 2006 the RBZ revalued the Zimbabwean Dollar by 1000 ZWD to 1
(revalued) dollar. At the same time Zimbabwe devalued the Zim Dollar by 60%
against the USD. New official exchange rate revalued ZWD 250 per USD. The
parallel market rate was about revalued ZWD 1,200 to 1,500 per USD (28
September 2006).

In November 2006, it was announced that sometime around 1 December there would
be a further devaluation and that the official exchange rate would change to
revalued ZWD 750 per USD. This never materialized. However, the parallel
market immediately reacted to this news with the parallel rate falling to ZWD
2,000 per USD (18 November 2006) and by year end it had fallen to ZWD 3,000
per USD.

On 1 April 2007, the parallel market was asking ZWD 30,000 for US$1. By year
end, it was down to about ZWD 2,000,000. On 18 January 2008, the Reserve Bank
of Zimbabwe began to issue higher denomination ZWD bearer cheques (a banknote
with an expiry date), including $10 million bearer cheques – each of which was
worth less than US$1.35 (70p Sterling; 0.90 Euro) on the parallel market at
the time of first issue. On 4 April 2008 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
introduced new $25 million and $50 million bearer cheques. At the time of
first issue they were worth US$0.70 and US$1.40 on the parallel market
respectively.

On 1 May 2008, the RBZ announced that the dollar would be allowed to float in
value subject to some conditions.

On 6 May 2008, the RBZ issued new $100 million and $250 million bearer
cheques. At the date of first issue the $250 million bearer cheque was worth
approximately US$1.30 on the parallel market. On 15 May 2008, a new $500
million bearer cheque was issued by the RBZ. At the time of the first issue it
was worth US$1.93. In a widely unreported parallel move, on 15 May 2008, the
RBZ issued three "special agro-cheques" with face values $5 billion (at time
of first issue – $19.30), $25 billion ($96.50) and $50 billion ($193). It is
further reported that the new agro-cheques can be used to buy any goods and
services like the bearer cheques.

On 30 July 2008, the Governor of the RBZ, Gideon Gono announced that the
Zimbabwe dollar would be redenominated by removing 10 zeroes, with effect from
1 August 2008. ZWD10billion became 1 dollar after the redenomination.

More banknotes were issued since Gono vowed to continue printing money:
$10,000 and $20,000 (29 September); $50,000 (13 October); $100,000, $500,000
and $1 million (3 November); $10 million (2 December); $50 million and $100
million (4 December); $200 million (9 December); $500 million (11 December);
$10 billion (19 December); $1 trillion (17 January 2009).

On February 2, 2009, a final denomination was implemented, cutting 12 zeroes,
before the Zimbabwe dollar was officially abandoned on April 12, 2009. Pending
economic recovery, Zimbabwe relied on foreign currency rather than introducing
a new currency.

### Dollarization: 2009–present

In February 2009, the newly installed national unity government (which
included the opposition to Mugabe) allowed foreign currency transactions
throughout the economy as a measure to stimulate the economy and end
inflation. The Zimbabwean dollar quickly lost all credibility, and by April
2009, the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended entirely, to be replaced by the US
dollar in government transactions. In 2014 there were eight legal currencies –
US dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling,
Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.

Dollarization reversed inflation, permitting the banking system to stabilize
and the economy to resume slow growth after 2009. Dollarization also had other
consequences, including:

  * Reduced taxation and financial transparency, as people continued to keep their money out of the formal banking system.
  * Extremely high real interest rates due to lack of capital.
  * Government forced into a "pay as you go" system, unable to spend more than it takes in.
  * Deficits of coinage for everyday transactions, leading to the adoption of South African rand coins, sweets, airtime for mobile phones or even condoms for small change.
  * Counterfeiting currencies with which Zimbabweans are not familiar.
  * 10% growth of the economy a year up to 2012

In January, 2013 Finance Minister Tendai Biti announced that Zimbabwe's
national public account held just $217. The election budget for the July 2013
presidential election was $104 million and government budget for 2013 was
$3.09 billion at a projected economic growth of 5 per cent. The Economist
described the 2013 election as "rigged" and how, after regaining full control
of the government, the Mugabe government doubled the civil service and
embarked on "...misrule and dazzling corruption."

In August 2014, Zimbabwe began selling treasury bills and bonds to pay public
sector salaries that have been delayed as GDP growth weakens while the economy
experiences deflation. US$2 million was sold in July through private
placements of Six-month Treasury bills at an interest rate of 9.5%. According
to IMF data, GDP growth was forecast to be 3.1% by the end of 2014, a major
decline from an average rate of 10% between 2009 and 2012, while government
data showed that consumer prices declined for five consecutive months by the
end of June. The Reserve Bank continued to issue large values of treasury
bills to support the government's over-budget spending. This added to the
money supply and in effect devalued all bank balances, despite them being US
Dollar denominated.

In November 2016 a pseudo-currency was issued in the form of Bond Notes
despite widespread protests against them. In February 2019, John Mangudya,
through a monetary policy presentation formally introduced a new currency, the
RTGS dollar which consists of electronic balances in banks and mobile wallets,
bond notes and bond coins. This completed the conversion of all US Dollar
denominated bank balances to a devalued Zimbabwean currency at a rate of 1:1.

In June 2019 the use of foreign currencies in local transactions was
prohibited as part of the prospective plan for a new national currency and
thus ended the dollarization period. There was still low volume trade in US
Dollars, particularly in the informal sector and using in-shop bureau de
change. In March 2020, blaming the challenges of dealing with COVID-19, the
government allowed formal transactions in US Dollars once more. Zimbabwe once
more extended its multi-currency system from 2025 until 31 December 2030 in
October 2023 as a result of declining trust in the Zimbabwean dollar, which
also declined by more than 80% in 2023.

### Government of National Unity: 2009–2013

In response to the negative long-term economic situation the three
parliamentary parties agreed on a Government of National Unity. Despite
serious internal differences this government made some important decisions
that improved the general economic situation, first of all the suspension of
the national currency, the Zimbabwean Dollar, in April 2009. That stopped
hyperinflation and made normal forms of business possible again, by using
foreign currency such as the US American Dollar, the South African Rand, the
EUs Euro or the Botswana Pula. The former finance minister Tendai Biti (MDC-T)
tried to hold a disciplined budget. In 2009 Zimbabwe recorded a period of
economic growth for the first time in a decade.

### Post-Government of National Unity: 2013–2020

Following ZANU-PF's landslide electoral victory in the 2013 general elections,
Patrick Chinamasa was appointed finance minister. Policies encouraging the
indigenisation of the economy were fast tracked and laws requiring that 51% or
more of non-black Zimbabwean owned companies had to be handed over to black
Zimbabweans were implemented. This has been credited with creating further
uncertainty in the economy and negatively impacting investment climate in the
country. Although legislation dealing with the indigenisation of the
Zimbabwean economy has been in development since 2007 and actively initiated
by ZANU-PF in 2010 the policy has continued to be accused of being unclear and
a form of "racketeering by regulation." The government doubled the civil
service and embarked on what the Economist described as "...misrule and
dazzling corruption."

In April 2014, Chinamasa admitted that the country was heavily in debt and
that the country needed to better attract foreign direct investment.
Officially Zimbabwe's debt is $7 billion, or over 200% of the country's GDP.
However, this figure is disputed, with figures as high as $11 billion being
quoted, once debts to other African countries and China are included. As of
May 2014, it has been reported that Zimbabwe's economy was in decline
following the period of relative economic stability during the Government of
National Unity. It is estimated that Zimbabwe's manufacturing sector requires
an investment of roughly US$8 billion for working capital and equipment
upgrades.

In 2016 Tendai Biti, an opposition politician estimated the government was
running a deficit of up to 12% of GDP and Zimbabwe began experiencing a
significant shortage of US dollars partly due to a consistent trade deficit.
This prompted the Zimbabwean government to limit cash withdrawals from banks
and change exchange-control regulations in order to try to promote exports and
reduce the currency shortage. In June and July 2016, after Government
employees had not been paid for weeks, police had set up road blocks to coerce
money out of tourists and there were protests throughout Zimbabwe, Patrick
Chinamasa, the finance minister, toured Europe in an effort to raise
investment capital and loans, admitting "Right now we have nothing." In August
2016 the government announced that it would be laying off 25,000 civil
servants (8% of the country's 298,000 civil servants), cut the number of
embassies and diplomatic expenses and cut ministerial expenses in an attempt
to save $4 billion in annual wages and secure help from the World Bank and the
IMF.

At the same time, the government sought to improve women's access to
microfinance via the Zimbabwe Women Microfinance Bank Limited, which began
operations 29 May 2018. The Bank operates under the supervision of the
Ministry of Women's Affairs, Gender and Community Development.

#### Re-adoption of the Zimbabwe Dollar

In mid-July 2019 inflation had increased to 175% following the adoption of a
new Zimbabwe dollar and banning the use of foreign currency thereby sparking
fresh concerns that the country was entering a new period of hyperinflation.
The Zimbabwean government stopped releasing inflation data in August 2019. The
year-on-year inflation rate was 521% in December 2019, but Zimbabwe central
bank officials said in February 2020 that they hoped to reduce the figure to
50% by the end of December 2020.
