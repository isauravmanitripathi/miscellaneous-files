The economy of Bangladesh is a major developing mixed economy. As the second-
largest economy in South Asia, Bangladesh's economy is the 35th largest in the
world in nominal terms, and 25th largest by purchasing power parity.
Bangladesh is seen by various financial institutions as one of the Next
Eleven. It has been transitioning from being a frontier market into an
emerging market. Bangladesh is a member of the South Asian Free Trade Area and
the World Trade Organization. In fiscal year 2021–2022, Bangladesh registered
a GDP growth rate of 7.2% after the global pandemic. Bangladesh is one of the
fastest growing economies in the world.

Industrialisation in Bangladesh received a strong impetus after the partition
of India due to labour reforms and new industries. Between 1947 and 1971, East
Bengal generated between 70% and 50% of Pakistan's exports. Modern Bangladesh
embarked on economic reforms in the late 1970s which promoted free markets and
foreign direct investment. By the 1990s, the country had a booming ready-made
garments industry. As of 16 March 2024, Bangladesh has the highest number of
green garment factories in the world with Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green
Building Council (USGBC), where 80 are platinum-rated, 119 are gold-rated, 10
are silver, and four are without any rating. As of 6 March 2024, Bangladesh is
home to 54 of the top 100 LEED Green Garment Factories globally, including 9
out of the top 10, and 18 out of the top 20. As of 27 April 2024, Bangladesh
has a growing pharmaceutical industry with 12 percent average annual growth
rate. Bangladesh is the only nation among the 48 least-developed countries
that is almost self-sufficient when it comes to medicine production as local
companies meet 98 percent of the domestic demand for pharmaceuticals.
Remittances from the large Bangladeshi diaspora became a vital source of
foreign exchange reserves. Agriculture in Bangladesh is supported by
government subsidies and ensures self-sufficiency in food production.
Bangladesh has pursued export-oriented industrialisation.

Bangladesh experienced robust growth after the pandemic with macroeconomic
stability, improvements in infrastructure, a growing digital economy, and
growing trade flows. Tax collection remains very low, with tax revenues
accounting for only 7.7% of GDP. Bangladesh's banking sector has a large
amount of non-performing loans or loan defaults, which have caused a lot of
concern. The private sector makes up 80% of GDP. The Dhaka Stock Exchange and
Chittagong Stock Exchange are the two stock markets of the country. Most
Bangladeshi businesses are privately owned small and medium-sized enterprises
(SME) which make up 90% of all businesses.

## Economic history

### Precolonial period

This African giraffe was imported into Bengal region and re-exported to China
circa 1415. The major maritime trade routes of the Bengal Sultanate

Punch-marked coins are the earliest form of currency found in Bangladesh
(Bengal region of Ancient India), dating back to the Iron Age and the first
millennium BCE. 1st century Roman coins with images of Hercules have been
excavated in Bangladesh and point to trade links with the Roman world. The
Wari-Bateshwar ruins are believed to be the emporium (trading center) of
Sounagoura mentioned by Roman geographer Claudius Ptolemy. The eastern segment
of Bengal was a historically prosperous region. The Ganges Delta provided
advantages of a mild, almost tropical climate, fertile soil, ample water, and
an abundance of fish, wildlife, and fruit. Living standards for the elite were
comparatively better than other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Trade routes
like the Grand Trunk Road, Tea Horse Road and Silk Road connected the region
to the wider neighborhood. Between 400 and 1200, the region had a well-
developed economy in terms of land ownership, agriculture, livestock,
shipping, trade, commerce, taxation, and banking. Muslim trade with Bengal
increased after the fall of the Sasanian Empire and the Arab takeover of
Persian trade routes. Much of this trade occurred east of the Meghna River in
southeastern Bengal. After 1204, Muslim conquerors inherited the gold and
silver reserves of pre-Islamic kingdoms.

The Bengal Sultanate presided over a mercantile empire of its own. Bengali
ships were the largest ships in the Bay of Bengal and other parts of the
Indian Ocean trade network. Ship-owning merchants often acted as royal envoys
of the Sultan. A large number of wealthy Bengali merchants and shipowners
lived in Malacca. A vessel from Bengal transported embassies from Brunei and
Sumatra to China. Bengal and the Maldives operated the largest shell currency
network in history. A Masai giraffe from Malindi in Africa was shipped to
Bengal and later gifted to the Emperor of China as a gift from the Sultan of
Bengal. The rulers of Arakan looked to Bengal for economic, political and
cultural capital. The Sultan of Bengal financed projects in the Hejaz region
of Arabia.

Under Mughal rule, Bengal operated as a centre of the worldwide muslin, silk
and pearl trades. Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products
such as rice, silks and cotton textiles. Overseas, Europeans depended on
Bengali products such as cotton textiles, silks and opium; Bengal accounted
for 40% of Dutch imports from Asia, for example. Bengal shipped saltpeter to
Europe, sold opium in Indonesia, exported raw silk to Japan and the
Netherlands, and produced cotton and silk textiles for export to Europe,
Indonesia and Japan. Real wages and living standards in 18th-century Bengal
were comparable to Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in
Europe.

During the Mughal era, the most important centre of cotton production was
Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being
called "daka" in distant markets such as Central Asia. Bengali
agriculturalists rapidly learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and
sericulture, establishing Bengal as a major silk-producing region of the
world. Bengal accounted for more than 50% of textiles and around 80% of silks
imported by the Dutch from Asia, for example.

Bengal also had a large shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding output of
Bengal during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was 223,250 tons
annually, compared with 23,061 tons produced in nineteen colonies in North
America from 1769 to 1771. The region was also a center of ship-repairing.
Bengali shipbuilding was advanced compared to European shipbuilding at the
time. An important innovation in shipbuilding was the introduction of a
flushed deck design in Bengal rice ships, resulting in hulls that were
stronger and less prone to leak than the structurally weak hulls of
traditional European ships built with a stepped deck design. The English East
India Company later duplicated the flushed-deck and hull designs of Bengal
rice ships in the 1760s, leading to significant improvements in seaworthiness
and navigation for European ships during the Industrial Revolution. Among the
oldest businesses from the pre-colonial and Mughal periods, the biryani
restaurant Fakhruddin's traces its history to the era of the Nawabs of Bengal.

### Colonial period

The _Barkentine Linnet_ , a ship built in Chittagong, off the coast of Hong
Kong circa 1890

The British East India Company, that took complete control of Bengal in 1793
by abolishing Nizamat (local rule), chose to develop Calcutta, now the capital
city of West Bengal, as their commercial and administrative center for the
Company-held territories in South Asia. The development of East Bengal was
thereafter limited to agriculture. The administrative infrastructure of the
late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries focused on East Bengal's function as
a primarily agricultural producer—chiefly of rice, tea, teak, cotton, sugar
cane and jute — for processors and traders in the British Empire. British rule
saw the introduction of railways. The Hardinge Bridge was built to carry
trains across the Padma River. In the early 20th century, Eastern Bengal and
Assam was established in the British Raj to promote jobs, education and
investment in East Bengal. In 1928, the Port of Chittagong was declared to be
a "Major Port" of British India. East Bengal extended its rice economy into
Arakan Division in British Burma. The river and sea ports of East Bengal,
including Goalundo Ghat, the Port of Dhaka, the Port of Narayanganj, and the
Port of Chittagong became entrepots for trade between Bengal, Assam and Burma.
Some of Bangladesh's venerable and oldest companies were born in British
Bengal, including A K Khan & Company, M. M. Ispahani Limited, James Finlay
Bangladesh, and Anwar Group of Industries.[_citation needed_]

### Pakistan period

Tannery owners with members of the Directorate of Industries, Government of
East Bengal in 1949 In the 1950s and 1960s, Adamjee Jute Mills was the largest
jute processing plant in the world.

The partition of India changed the economic geography of the region. The
Pakistani government in East Bengal prioritized industries based on local raw
materials like jute, cotton, and leather. The Korean War drove up demand for
jute products. Adamjee Jute Mills, the world's largest jute processing plant,
was built in the Port of Narayanganj. The plant was a symbol of East
Pakistan's industrialization. Living standards began to gradually improve.
Labor reforms in 1958 eventually benefitted a future independent Bangladesh to
develop industry. Free market principles were generally accepted. The
government promoted an industrial policy which aimed to produce consumer goods
as quickly as possible in order to avoid dependence on imports. Certain
sectors, like public utilities, fell under state ownership. Natural gas in
Sylhet was discovered by the Burmah Oil Company in 1955. By the late 1960s,
East Pakistan's share of Pakistan's exports went down from 70% to 50%.

Pakistan's rulers launched a so-called "Decade of Development" that "resulted
in numerous economic and social contradictions, which played themselves out,
not just in the 1960s, but beyond, where Ayub Khan's rule created the social
and economic conditions leading to the separation of East Pakistan". According
to the World Bank, economic discrimination against East Pakistan included
diverting foreign aid and other funds to West Pakistan, the use of East
Pakistan's foreign-exchange surpluses to finance West Pakistani imports, and
refusal by the central government to release funds allocated to East Pakistan.
Rehman Sobhan paraphrased the Two-Nation Theory into the Two Economies Theory
by arguing that East and West Pakistan diverged and became two different
economies within one country.

### Post-independence period

#### Socialist era (1972–1975)

After its independence from Pakistan, Bangladesh initially followed a
socialist economy for five years, which proved to be a blunder by the Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman-led Awami League government. During Mujib era, the state
development strategy envolved every possible way to the extension of
protectionism. Private companies had to operate under heavy regulation and
restrictions. For example, profit limits were imposed on companies. Any
company with revenues or profits above the limit were susceptible to
nationalization. The state nationalized all banks, insurance companies, and
580 industrial plants. Many of the nationalized industries were abandoned by
West Pakistanis during the war; while many pro-Awami League and other Bengali
businesses also suffered nationalization of properties and industries. The
Awami League initiated work for the Ghorashal Fertilizer Factory and the
Ashuganj Power Station. In spite of restrictions, several of Bangladesh's
leading companies in the future were founded during this period, including
BEXIMCO and Advanced Chemical Industries. Land ownership was restricted to
less than 25 _bighas_. Land owners with more than 25 _bighas_ were subjected
to taxes. Farmers had to sell their products at prices set by the government
instead of the market.

Since Bangladesh followed a socialist economy, it underwent a slow growth of
producing experienced entrepreneurs, managers, administrators, engineers, and
technicians. There was hardly any foreign investment. There were critical
shortages of essential food grains and other staples because of wartime
disruptions. External markets for jute had been lost because of the
instability of supply and the increasing popularity of synthetic substitutes.
Foreign exchange resources were minuscule, and the banking and monetary
systems were unreliable. Although Bangladesh had a large work force, the vast
reserves of under trained and underpaid workers were largely illiterate,
unskilled, and underemployed. Commercially exploitable industrial resources,
except for natural gas, were lacking. Inflation, especially for essential
consumer goods, ran between 300 and 400 percent.

The war of independence had crippled the transportation system. Hundreds of
road and railroad bridges had been destroyed or damaged, and rolling stock was
inadequate and in poor repair. The new country was still recovering from a
severe cyclone that hit the area in 1970 and caused 250,000 deaths. India came
forward immediately with critically measured economic assistance in the first
months after Bangladesh achieved independence from Pakistan. Between December
1971 and January 1972, India committed US$232 million in aid to Bangladesh
from the politico-economic aid India received from the US and USSR.

#### Military rule and economic reforms (1975–1990)

After 1975 coups, new Bangladeshi military leaders began to promote private
industry and turned their attention to developing new industrial capacity and
rehabilitating the economy. The socialist economic model adopted by early
leaders had resulted in inefficiency and economic stagnation. Beginning in
late 1975, the government gradually gave greater scope to private sector
participation in the economy, a pattern that has continued since then.

After Lt. Gen. Ziaur Rahman's ascension to the power in 1975, new strategy was
taken to encourage private enterprise with a primary goal of maximization of
GNP growth rate. Zia's government revised the First Five-Year Plan (1973–1978)
taken by the Mujib government and formulated a "Three year hard core plan" for
remaining three years. This was followed by the Two-Year Plan (1978-80) and
the Second Five Year Plan (1980-85). The government also established special
economic zones called Export Processing Zones (EPZs) to attract investors and
promote export industries. These zones have played a key role in Bangladesh's
export economy. The government also de-nationalized and privatized state-owned
industries by either returning them to their original owners or selling them
to private buyers. Meanwhile, inefficiency in the public sector gradually
increased; and left-wing opposition grew against the export of natural gas.

The 1980s saw the emergence of dynamic local brands like PRAN. Muhammad Yunus
began experimenting with microcredit in the late 1970s. In 1983, the Grameen
Bank was established. Bangladesh became the pioneer of the modern microcredit
industry, with leading players like Grameen Bank, BRAC and Proshika. In the
industrial sector, two policy innovations in the mid-1980s helped exporters.
The reforms introduced the back-to-back letter of credit and duty-drawback
facilities through bonded warehouses. These reforms removed major constraints
for the country's fledgling garment industry. The reforms allowed a garment
manufacturer to obtain letters of credit from domestic banks to finance its
import of inputs, by showing letters of credit from foreign buyers of
garments. The reforms also reimbursed manufacturers the duty paid on imported
inputs on proof that the inputs, stored in bonded warehouses, had been used to
manufacture the exports. These reforms spurred the growth of industry into the
world's second largest textile exporting sector.

In the mid-1980s, there were encouraging signs of progress. Economic policies
aimed at encouraging private enterprise and investment, privatising public
industries, reinstating budgetary discipline, and liberalising the import
regime were accelerated. The International Finance Investment and Commerce
Bank was set up as a multinational bank for Bangladesh, Nepal and the
Maldives.

#### Economic growth (1991–2022)

Jamuna Bridge opened in 1998. Between 1988 and 1998, Bangladesh expanded its
rural road network from 3000 km to 15,500 km. Construction of Padma Bridge,
which opened in 2022

From 1991 to 1993, the government engaged in an enhanced structural adjustment
facility (ESAF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A series of
economic liberalization measures was introduced by finance minister Saifur
Rahman, including opening up sectors like telecom to foreign investment. The
Chittagong Stock Exchange was also set up. The 1990s was a boon for the
private sector. Banking, telecommunications, aviation and tertiary education
saw new private players and increased competition. The pharmaceutical industry
in Bangladesh grew to meet 98% of domestic demand. The ceramics industry in
Bangladesh developed to meet local demand for 96% of tableware ceramics, 77%
of tiles and 89% of sanitary ceramics. The Chittagong-based steel industry in
Bangladesh exploited scrap steel from ship-breaking yards and started
contributing to shipbuilding in Bangladesh.

But the government failed to sustain reforms in large part because of
preoccupation with the government's domestic political troubles, including
tensions between the Awami League, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
Jatiya Party. Frequent hartals and strikes disrupted the economy. In the late
1990s the government's economic policies became more entrenched, and some
gains were lost, which was highlighted by a precipitous drop in foreign direct
investment in 2000 and 2001. Many new private commercial banks were given
licenses to operate.

Between 2001 and 2006, annual GDP growth touched an average of 5-6%. In June
2003 the IMF approved 3-year, $490-million plan as part of the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for Bangladesh that aimed to support the
government's economic reform programme up to 2006. Seventy million dollars was
made available immediately. In the same vein the World Bank approved $536
million in interest-free loans. The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of
at least 6% since 2009. Bangladesh emerged as one of the fastest growing
economies.

According to economist Syed Akhtar Mahmood, the Bangladeshi government is
often seen as the villain in the country's economic story. But government has
played an important role in stimulating the economy through building
infrastructure, liberalizing regulations, and promoting high yielding crops in
agriculture. According to Mahmood, "[m]ost roads linking the villages with one
another, and with the cities, were not paved and not accessible throughout the
year. This situation was remarkably transformed within a span of 10 years,
from 1988 to 1997, with the construction of the so-called feeder roads. In
1988, Bangladesh had about 3,000 kilometers of feeder roads. By 1997, this
network expanded to 15,500 kilometers. These "last-mile" all-weather roads
helped connect the villages of Bangladesh to the rest of the country".

As a result of export-led growth, Bangladesh has enjoyed a trade surplus in
recent years. Bangladesh historically has run a large trade deficit, financed
largely through aid receipts and remittances from workers overseas. Foreign
reserves dropped markedly in 2001 but stabilised in the US$3 to US$4 billion
range (or about 3 months' import cover). In January 2007, reserves stood at
$3.74 billion, and then increased to $5.8 billion by January 2008, in November
2009 it surpassed $10.0 billion, and as of April 2011 it surpassed the US$12
billion according to the Bank of Bangladesh, the central bank. The dependence
on foreign aid and imports has also decreased gradually since the early 1990s.
Foreign aid now accounts for only 2% of GDP.

In the last decade, poverty dropped by around one third with significant
improvements in the human development index, literacy, life expectancy and per
capita food consumption. With the economy growing annually at an average rate
of 6% over a prolonged period, more than 15 million people have moved out of
poverty since 1992. The poverty rate went down from 80% in 1971 to 44.2% in
1991 to 12.9% in 2021. In recent years, Bangladesh has focused on promoting
regional trade and transport links. The Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal Motor
Vehicles Agreement seeks to create hassle free road transport across
international borders. Bangladesh also signed a coastal shipping agreement
with India. While prioritizing food security in the domestic market,
Bangladesh exports more than US$1 billion worth of processed food products. As
the result of a robust agricultural supply chain, supermarkets have sprung up
in cities and towns across the country.

Bangladesh became the second largest textile exporter in the world. An
estimated 4.4 million workers are employed in the garments industry, with the
majority being women. The sector contributes 11% of Bangladesh's GDP. The 2013
Rana Plaza factory collapse caused global concern on industrial safety in
Bangladesh, leading to the formation of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety
in Bangladesh and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. The local
clothing industry has seen fiercely competitive brands vying for the market,
including Aarong, Westecs, Ecstasy, and Yellow among many others.

The World Bank notes the economic progress of the country by stating that
"[w]hen the newly independent country of Bangladesh was born on December 16,
1971, it was the second poorest country in the world—making the country's
transformation over the next 50 years one of the great development stories.
Since then, poverty has been cut in half at record speed. Enrolment in primary
school is now nearly universal. Hundreds of thousands of women have entered
the workforce. Steady progress has been made on maternal and child health. And
the country is better buttressed against the destructive forces posed by
climate change and natural disasters. Bangladesh's success comprises many
moving parts—from investing in human capital to establishing macroeconomic
stability. Building on this success, the country is now setting the stage for
further economic growth and job creation by ramping up investments in energy,
inland connectivity, urban projects, and transport infrastructure, as well as
prioritizing climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness on its path
toward sustainable growth".

As of 2022, Bangladesh had the second largest foreign-exchange reserves in
South Asia. In 2021, Bangladesh surpassed both India and Pakistan in terms of
per capita income. The country achieved 100% electricity coverage for
households in 2022. Megaprojects like the Padma Bridge, Dhaka Metro, Matarbari
Port, and Karnaphuli Tunnel have been planned to stimulate economic activity.
The completion of Padma Bridge was expected to boost Bangladeshi GDP by 1.23%.

#### Economic depression (2022–present)

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Bangladesh experienced pressure on
its foreign exchange reserves due to rising import costs; this affected the
country's electricity sector which relies on imported fuel; rising import
prices also contributed to inflation. International Monetary Fund (IMF) had
forecasted Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Bangladesh to rise to 5.9% by the
year 2022. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, general inflation
climbed to 6.17% by February 2022.

Due to the mass uprising and subsequent violence of July–August 2024,
Bangladeshi economy witnessed a huge loss. Bangladesh's economy suffered
losses of over $1.2 billion as a result of the nationwide curfew and protests.
As per the South Asia Development Update, the World Bank revised its economic
growth forecast from 5.7% in April 2024 to 4% in October for the financial
year 2025. Political instability exacerbated preexisting inflation. Food
inflation under the incumbent interim government reached 14% and general
inflation 11%. A sudden sharp rise in inflation in July 2024 was mostly
attributed to the political turmoil facing Bangladesh; after momentary
stabilization, inflation once again begun to increase. The general inflation
rate in Bangladesh reached 10.87%, up from 9.92% in September 2024.[_improper
synthesis?_] In November 2024, the International Crisis Group (ICG) said
"early signs suggest that policymakers can avoid a Sri Lanka-style economic
crash" and added exchange rate reforms helped improve foreign reserves while
inflation had declined from its peak, although it warned that "serious
economic risks remain". The crisis group also said that long-term economic
reform was "far longer" than the interim governments "likely lifespan",
stating that the government was focused on "short-term macro-economic
priorities" such as inflation, foreign reserves and economic stability.

On April 2025, the Trump administration imposed 37% "reciprocal" tariff on
Bangladesh, which is second highest in South Asia just after Sri Lanka (44%).
_New York Times_ described it a major blow particularly for the garments
industry of Bangladesh. Many US buyers started to halt orders saying that it
was to costly to bear the import tariffs.

### Agriculture

The growing areas of major agricultural products.

Development of agricultural output of Bangladesh in 2019 US$ since 1961 As
watercourses such as canals, both natural and manmade, and rivers contribute
as the vital source of irrigation, their spread across the country is
attributed as a key factor for the economic and geographic extent of
agriculture in Bangladesh. Photographed is a process of irrigation underway in
Comilla, enabled by a pump that is extracting water from the Gumti seen in the
background.

Agriculture is the largest employment sector in Bangladesh, making up 14.2
percent of Bangladesh's GDP in 2017 and employing about 42.7 percent of the
workforce. As of the financial year 2022 to 2023, the agricultural sector
contributed to more than 12% of GDP. The performance of this sector has an
overwhelming impact on major macroeconomic objectives like employment
generation, poverty alleviation, human resources development, food security,
and other economic and social forces. A plurality of Bangladeshis earn their
living from agriculture. Due to a number of factors, Bangladesh's labour-
intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production
despite the often unfavorable weather conditions. These include better flood
control and irrigation, a generally more efficient use of fertilisers, as well
as the establishment of better distribution and rural credit networks.

Although rice and jute are the primary crops, maize and vegetables are
assuming greater importance. Due to the expansion of irrigation networks, some
wheat producers have switched to cultivation of maize which is used mostly as
poultry feed. Tea is grown in the northeast. There are 166 tea estates in
Bangladesh, covering almost 280,000 acres of land. Bangladesh is the 9th
largest Tea producer, producing around 2% of the world’s Tea production.
Because of Bangladesh's fertile soil and normally ample water supply, rice can
be grown and harvested three times a year in many areas. The country is among
the top producers of rice (third), potatoes (seventh), tropical fruits
(sixth), jute (second), and farmed fish (fifth). With 35.8 million metric tons
produced in 2000, rice is Bangladesh's principal crop. As of 2024, it is
expected that rice production in Bangladesh will exceed 37.7 million metric
tons, an increase of nearly 700000 tons from last year. Bangladesh produces
almost 5 metric tons of rice per hectare, making the country self sufficient
in rice production. In comparison to rice, wheat output in 1999 was 1.9
million tonnes (1,900,000 long tons; 2,100,000 short tons).

Population pressure continues to place a severe burden on productive capacity,
sometimes creating a food deficit, especially of wheat. Foreign assistance and
commercial imports fill the gap. Underemployment remains a serious problem,
and a growing concern for Bangladesh's agricultural sector will be its ability
to absorb additional manpower. Finding alternative sources of employment will
continue to be a daunting problem for future governments, particularly with
the increasing numbers of landless peasants who already account for about half
the rural labour force. Other challenges facing the sector include
environmental issues: insecticides, water management challenges, pollution,
and land degradation all effect the agricultural system in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with extreme weather
and temperature changes significantly changing the conditions for growing
food. Adaptation of the agricultural sector is a major concern for policy
addressing climate change in Bangladesh.

### Manufacturing and industry

KAFCO plant in Chittagong

Many new jobs – mostly for women – have been created by the country's dynamic
private ready-made garment industry, which grew at double-digit rates through
most of the 1990s. By the late 1990s, about 1.5 million people, mostly women,
were employed in the garments sector as well as Leather products specially
Footwear (Shoe manufacturing unit). During 2001–2002, export earnings from
ready-made garments reached $3,125 million, representing 52% of Bangladesh's
total exports. Bangladesh has overtaken India in apparel exports in 2009, its
exports stood at 2.66 billion US dollar, ahead of India's 2.27 billion US
dollar and in 2014 the export rose to $3.12 billion every month. At the fiscal
year 2018, Bangladesh has been able to garner US$36.67 billion export earnings
by exporting manufactured goods, of which, 83.49 percent has come from the
apparel manufacturing sector.

Eastern Bengal was known for its fine muslin and silk fabric before the
British period. The dyes, yarn, and cloth were the envy of much of the
premodern world. Bengali muslin, silk, and brocade were worn by the
aristocracy of Asia and Europe. The introduction of machine-made textiles from
England in the late eighteenth century spelled doom for the costly and time-
consuming hand loom process. Cotton growing died out in East Bengal, and the
textile industry became dependent on imported yarn. Those who had earned their
living in the textile industry were forced to rely more completely on farming.
Only the smallest vestiges of a once-thriving cottage industry survived.

Other industries which have shown very strong growth include the
pharmaceutical industry, shipbuilding industry, information technology,
leather industry, steel industry, and light engineering industry.

Bangladesh has a robust pharmaceutical industry. As of 27 April 2024,
Bangladesh is the only nation among the 48 least-developed countries that is
almost self-sufficient when it comes to medicine production as local companies
meet 98 percent of the demand while 213 pharmaceutical companies are operating
in Bangladesh and the industry clocks an average annual growth rate of 12
percent. Nine drug manufacturers have received approvals from regulators in
the United States, the European Union, and Australia as well as from the World
Health Organisation. The sector ships products to around 150 countries.

Bangladesh's textile industry, which includes knitwear and ready-made garments
(RMG) along with specialised textile products, is the nation's number one
export earner, accounting for $21.5 billion in 2013 – 80% of Bangladesh's
total exports of $27 billion. Bangladesh is 2nd in world textile exports,
behind China, which exported $120.1 billion worth of textiles in 2009. The
industry employs nearly 3.5 million workers. Current exports have doubled
since 2004. Wages in Bangladesh's textile industry were the lowest in the
world as of 2010. The country was considered the most formidable rival to
China where wages were rapidly rising and currency was appreciating. As of
2012 wages remained low for the 3 million people employed in the industry, but
labour unrest was increasing despite vigorous government action to enforce
labour peace. Owners of textile firms and their political allies were a
powerful political influence in Bangladesh. The urban garment industry has
created more than one million formal sector jobs for women, contributing to
the high female labour participation in Bangladesh. While it can be argued
that women working in the garment industry are subjected to unsafe labour
conditions and low wages, Dina M. Siddiqi argues that even though conditions
in Bangladesh garment factories "are by no means ideal," they still give women
in Bangladesh the opportunity to earn their own wages. As evidence she points
to the fear created by the passage of the 1993 Harkins Bill (Child Labor
Deterrence Bill), which caused factory owners to dismiss "an estimated 50,000
children, many of whom helped support their families, forcing them into a
completely unregulated informal sector, in lower-paying and much less secure
occupations such as brick-breaking, domestic service and rickshaw pulling."

Even though the working conditions in garment factories are not ideal, they
tend to financially be more reliable than other occupations and, "enhance
women's economic capabilities to spend, save and invest their incomes." Both
married and unmarried women send money back to their families as remittances,
but these earned wages have more than just economic benefits. Many women in
the garment industry are marrying later, have lower fertility rates, and
attain higher levels of education, then women employed elsewhere.

After massive labour unrest in 2006 the government formed a Minimum Wage Board
including business and worker representatives which in 2006 set a minimum wage
equivalent to 1,662.50 taka, $24 a month, up from Tk950. In 2010, following
widespread labour protests involving 60,000 workers in June 2010, a
controversial proposal was being considered by the Board which would raise the
monthly minimum to the equivalent of $50 a month, still far below worker
demands of 5,000 taka, $72, for entry level wages, but unacceptably high
according to textile manufacturers who are asking for a wage below $30. On 28
July 2010 it was announced that the minimum entry level wage would be
increased to 3,000 taka, about $43.

The government also seems to believe some change is necessary. On 21 September
2006 then ex-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia called on textile firms to ensure the
safety of workers by complying with international labour law at a speech
inaugurating the Bangladesh Apparel & Textile Exposition (BATEXPO).

Many Western multinationals use labour in Bangladesh, which is one of the
cheapest in the world: 30 euros per month compared to 150 or 200 in China.
Four days is enough for the CEO of one of the top five global textile brands
to earn what a Bangladeshi garment worker will earn in her lifetime. In April
2013, at least 1,135 textile workers died in the collapse of their factory.
Other fatal accidents due to unsanitary factories have affected Bangladesh: in
2005 a factory collapsed and caused the death of 64 people. In 2006, a series
of fires killed 85 people and injured 207 others. In 2010, some 30 people died
of asphyxiation and burns in two serious fires.

In 2006, tens of thousands of workers mobilized in one of the country's
largest strike movements, affecting almost all of the 4,000 factories. The
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) uses police
forces to crack down. Three workers were killed, hundreds more were wounded by
bullets, or imprisoned. In 2010, after a new strike movement, nearly 1,000
people were injured among workers as a result of the repression.

### Shipbuilding and shipbreaking

The _BNS Durgam_ is a naval vessel built in Bangladesh.

Shipbuilding is a growing industry in Bangladesh with great potential. Due to
the potential of shipbuilding in Bangladesh, the country has been compared to
countries like China, Japan and South Korea. Referring to the growing amount
of export deals secured by the shipbuilding companies as well as the low cost
labour available in the country, experts suggest that Bangladesh could emerge
as a major competitor in the global market of small to medium ocean-going
vessels.

Bangladesh also has the world's largest ship breaking industry which employs
over 200,000 Bangladeshis and accounts for half of all the steel in
Bangladesh. Chittagong Ship Breaking Yard is the world's second-largest ship
breaking area.

Khulna Shipyard Limited (KSY) with over five decades of reputation has been
leading the Bangladesh Shipbuilding industry and had built a wide spectrum of
ships for domestic and international clients. KSY built ships for Bangladesh
Navy, Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Coast Guard under the contract of
ministry of defence.

### Finance

Most banks in Bangladesh are privately owned. Until the 1980s, the financial
sector of Bangladesh was dominated by state-owned banks. With the grand-scale
reform made in finance, private commercial banks were established through
privatisation. The next finance sector reform programme was launched from 2000
to 2006 with focus on the development of financial institutions and adoption
of risk-based regulations and supervision by Bangladesh Bank. As of date, the
banking sector consisted of 4 SCBs, 4 government-owned specialized banks
dealing in development financing, 39 private commercial banks, and 9 foreign
commercial banks.

### Tourism

The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2013 that the travel
and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,281,500 jobs in 2012
or 1.8 percent of the country's total employment, which ranked Bangladesh 157
out of 178 countries worldwide. Direct and indirect employment in the industry
totalled 2,714,500 jobs, or 3.7 percent of the country's total employment. The
WTTC predicted that by 2023, travel and tourism will directly generate
1,785,000 jobs and support an overall total of 3,891,000 jobs, or 4.2 percent
of the country's total employment. This would represent an annual growth rate
in direct jobs of 2.9 percent. Domestic spending generated 97.7 percent of
direct travel and tourism gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. Bangladesh's
world ranking in 2012 for travel and tourism's direct contribution to GDP, as
a percentage of GDP, was 142 out of 176.

in 2014 125,000 tourists visited Bangladesh. This number is extremely low
relative to total population. As of 22 May 2019 the total local population
numbering 166,594,000 inhabitants. This gives a ratio of 1 tourist for every
1,333 locals.

### Information and communication technology

Bangladesh's information technology sector is a sector that has seen much
growth in the past three years. Bangladesh has 80 million internet users, an
estimated 9% growth in internet use by June 2017 powered by mobile internet.
Bangladesh currently has an active 23 million Facebook users. Bangladesh
currently has 143.1 million mobile phone customers. Bangladesh exported $800
million worth of software, games, outsourcing and services to European
countries, the United States, Canada, Russia and India by 30 June 2017.

## Investment

The stock market capitalisation of the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh
crossed $10 billion in November 2007 and the $30 billion mark in 2009, and
US$50 billion in August 2010. Bangladesh had the best performing stock market
in Asia during the recent global recession between 2007 and 2010, due to
relatively low correlations with developed country stock markets.

Major investment in real estate by domestic and foreign-resident Bangladeshis
has led to a massive building boom in Dhaka and Chittagong.

Recent (2011) trends for investing in Bangladesh as Saudi Arabia trying to
secure public and private investment in oil and gas, power and transportation
projects, United Arab Emirates (UAE) is keen to invest in growing shipbuilding
industry in Bangladesh encouraged by comparative cost advantage, Tata, an
India-based leading industrial multinational to invest Taka 1500 crore to set
up an automobile industry in Bangladesh, World Bank to invest in rural roads
improving quality of live, the Rwandan entrepreneurs are keen to invest in
Bangladesh's pharmaceuticals sector considering its potentiality in
international market, Samsung sought to lease 500 industrial plots from the
export zones authority to set up an electronics hub in Bangladesh with an
investment of US$1.25 billion, National Board of Revenue (NBR) is set to
withdraw tax rebate facilities on investment in the capital market by
individual taxpayers from the fiscal 2011–12. In 2011, Japan Bank for
International Cooperation ranked Bangladesh as the 15th best investment
destination for foreign investors.

### 2010–11 market crash

The bullish capital market turned bearish during 2010, with the exchange
losing 1,800 points between December 2010 and January 2011. Millions of
investors have been rendered bankrupt as a result of the market crash. The
crash is believed to be caused artificially to benefit a handful of players at
the expense of the big players.

### Composition of economic sectors

A Square Pharmaceuticals plant in Gazipur

The Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) has
predicted textile exports will rise from US$7.90 billion earned in 2005–06 to
US$15 billion by 2011. In part this optimism stems from how well the sector
has fared since the end of textile and clothing quotas, under the Multifibre
Agreement, in early 2005.

According to a United Nations Development Programme report "Sewing Thoughts:
How to Realize Human Development Gains in the Post-Quota World" Bangladesh has
been able to offset a decline in European sales by cultivating new markets in
the United States.

"[In 2005] we had tremendous growth. The quota-free textile regime has proved
to be a big boost for our factories," said BGMEA president S.M. Fazlul Hoque
told reporters, after the sector's 24 per cent growth rate was revealed.

The Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA)
president Md Fazlul Hoque has also struck an optimistic tone. In an interview
with United News Bangladesh he lauded the blistering growth rate, saying "The
quality of our products and its competitiveness in terms of prices helped the
sector achieve such... tremendous success."

Knitwear posted the strongest growth of all textile products in 2005–06,
surging 35.38 per cent to US$2.82 billion. On the downside however, the
sector's strong growth came amid sharp falls in prices for textile products on
the world market, with growth subsequently dependent upon large increases in
volume.

Bangladesh's quest to boost the quantity of textile trade was also helped by
US and EU caps on Chinese textiles. The US cap restricts growth in imports of
Chinese textiles to 12.5 per cent next year and between 15 and 16 per cent in
2008. The EU deal similarly manages import growth until 2008.

Bangladesh may continue to benefit from these restrictions over the next two
years, however a climate of falling global textile prices forces wage rates
the centre of the nation's efforts to increase market share.

They offer a range of incentives to potential investors including 10-year tax
holidays, duty-free import of capital goods, raw materials and building
materials, exemptions on income tax on salaries paid to foreign nationals for
three years and dividend tax exemptions for the period of the tax holiday.

All goods produced in the zones are able to be exported duty-free, in addition
to which Bangladesh benefits from the Generalised System of Preferences in US,
European and Japanese markets and is also endowed with Most Favoured Nation
status from the United States.

Furthermore, Bangladesh imposes no ceiling on investment in the EPZs and
allows full repatriation of profits.

The formation of labour unions within the EPZs is prohibited as are strikes.

Bangladesh has been a world leader in its efforts to end the use of child
labour in garment factories. On 4 July 1995, the Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association, International Labour Organization,
and UNICEF signed a memorandum of understanding on the elimination of child
labour in the garment sector. Implementation of this pioneering agreement
began in fall 1995, and by the end of 1999, child labour in the garment trade
virtually had been eliminated. The labour-intensive process of ship breaking
for scrap has developed to the point where it now meets most of Bangladesh's
domestic steel needs. Other industries include sugar, tea, leather goods,
newsprint, pharmaceutical, and fertilizer production.

The Bangladesh government continues to court foreign investment, something it
has done fairly successfully in private power generation and gas exploration
and production, as well as in other sectors such as cellular telephony,
textiles, and pharmaceuticals. In 1989, the same year it signed a bilateral
investment treaty with the United States, it established a Board of Investment
to simplify approval and start-up procedures for foreign investors, although
in practice the board has done little to increase investment. The government
created the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority to manage the various
export processing zones. The agency currently manages EPZs in Adamjee,
Chittagong, Comilla, Dhaka, Ishwardi, Karnaphuli, Mongla, and Uttara. An EPZ
has also been proposed for Sylhet. The government has given the private sector
permission to build and operate competing EPZs-initial construction on a
Korean EPZ started in 1999. In June 1999, the AFL–CIO petitioned the U.S.
Government to deny Bangladesh access to U.S. markets under the Generalized
System of Preferences (GSP), citing the country's failure to meet promises
made in 1992 to allow freedom of association in EPZs.

## International trade

Chittagong port is the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal.

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on almost all sectors
of the economy, inter alia, most notably, it has caused a reduction of exports

## Bangladeshi women and the economy

Male and female labour participation rates

As of 2014, female participation in the labour force is 58 percent as per
World Bank data, and male participation at 82 percent. Through the efforts of
government and non-governmental organizations like CARE International, the
participation of women in the Bangladeshi politics and the economy has
improved drastically.

A 2007 World Bank report stated that the areas in which women's work force
participation have increased the most are in the fields of agriculture,
education and health and social work. Over three-quarters of women in the
labour force work in the agricultural sector. On the other hand, the
International Labour Organization reports that women's workforce participation
has only increased in the professional and administrative areas between 2000
and 2005, demonstrating women's increased participation in sectors that
require higher education. Employment and labour force participation data from
the World Bank, the UN, and the ILO vary and often under report on women's
work due to unpaid labour and informal sector jobs. Though these fields are
mostly paid, women experience very different work conditions than men,
including wage differences and work benefits. Women's wages are significantly
lower than men's wages for the same job with women being paid as much as 60–75
percent less than what men make.

One example of action that is being taken to improve female conditions in the
work force is Non-Governmental Organisations. These NGOs encourage women to
rely on their own self-savings, rather than external funds provide women with
increased decision-making and participation within the family and society.
However, some NGOs that address microeconomic issues among individual families
fail to deal with broader macroeconomic issues that prevent women's complete
autonomy and advancement.

## Historical statistics

Bangladesh has made significant strides in its economic sector performance
since independence in 1971. Although the economy has improved vastly in the
1990s, Bangladesh still suffers in the area of foreign trade in South Asian.
Despite major impediments to growth like the inefficiency of state-owned
enterprises[_citation needed_], a rapidly growing labour force that cannot be
absorbed by agriculture, inadequate power supplies, and slow implementation of
economic reforms, Bangladesh has made some headway improving the climate for
foreign investors and liberalising the capital markets; for example, it has
negotiated with foreign firms for oil and gas exploration, bettered the
countrywide distribution of cooking gas, and initiated the construction of
natural gas pipelines and power stations. Progress on other economic reforms
has been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector
unions, and other vested interest groups.

The especially severe floods of 1998 increased the flow of foreign aid. The
2008 financial crisis did not have a major impact on the economy. Foreign aid
has seen a gradual decline over the last few decades but economists see this
as a good sign for self-reliance. There has been a dramatic growth in exports
and remittance inflow which has helped the economy to expand at a steady rate.
Bangladesh's GDP is expected to grow at 5.3 percent in 2023 and 6.5 percent in
2024 according to the latest ADB report.

Bangladesh has been on the list of UN Least Developed Countries (LDC) since
1975. Bangladesh met the requirements to be recognised as a developing country
in March 2018 with Bangladesh's Gross National Income (GNI) US$1,724 per
capita, the Human Assets Index (HAI) 72 and the Economic Vulnerability (EVI)
Index 25.2 then. Bangladesh's GNI is now forecasted to reach at US$4,753.39 in
2030.
