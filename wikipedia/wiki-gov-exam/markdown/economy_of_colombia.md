The **economy of Colombia** is the fourth largest in Latin America as measured
by gross domestic product and the third-largest economy in South America.
Throughout most of the 20th century, Colombia was Latin America's 4th and 3rd
largest economy when measured by nominal GDP, real GDP, GDP (PPP), and real
GDP at chained PPPs. Between 2012 and 2014, it became the third largest in
Latin America by nominal GDP. As of 2024, the GDP (PPP) per capita has
increased to over US$19,000, and real gross domestic product at chained PPPs
increased from US$250 billion in 1990 to over US$1 trillion in 2024. Poverty
levels were as high as 65% in 1990, but decreased to under 30% by 2014, and
27% by 2018. They decreased by an average of 1.35% per year since 1990.

Petroleum is Colombia's main export, representing over 45% of Colombia's
exports. Manufacturing represents nearly 12% of Colombia's exports and grows
at a rate of over 10% a year. Colombia has the fastest growing information
technology industry in the world, and has the longest fibre optic network in
Latin America. Colombia also has one of the largest shipbuilding industries in
the world outside Asia.

Modern industries like shipbuilding, electronics, automobile, tourism,
construction, and mining grew dramatically during the 2000s and 2010s.
However, most of Colombia's exports are still commodity-based. Colombia is
Latin America's 2nd-largest producer of domestically made electronics and
appliances, following Mexico.

Since the early 2010s, the Colombian government has shown interest in
exporting modern Colombian pop culture to the world (which includes video
games, music, films, television shows, fashion, cosmetics, and food) as a way
of diversifying the economy and entirely changing the image of Colombia. This
has inspired a national campaign similar to the Korean Wave. Colombia is only
behind Mexico in cultural exports and is already a regional leader in cosmetic
and beauty exports.

Wealth is poorly distributed and Colombia is among the most unequal societies
in the world, with a Gini index of approximately 0.̟6. For example, according
to the World Bank, in 2010, the richest 20% of the population owned 60.2% of
the wealth and the poorest 20% only 3%, and 15.8% of Colombians lived on less
than $2 a day. In 2021, more than 54% of Colombian families are food insecure
and more than 560,000 children under the age of five are chronically
undernourished.

The informal economy is estimated at 47% in 2020. There is no welfare state in
Colombia, which has almost no unemployment or pension insurance system. As a
result, only one million elderly people have pensions (and five million are
without) and social assistance is very low. Many people in their 70s and 80s
are forced to continue working or beg. The country is said to be the most
unequal in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

## History

### 16th–19th centuries

European explorers reached what is now Colombian territory as early as 1510 in
Santa María Antigua del Darién (in present-day Chocó department). For the next
couple of decades Colombia, and South America in general, remained largely
unexplored. From 1533 to 1600, Europeans began expeditions into the interior
of current Colombia. The in of these expeditions was mainly to conquer new
lands and exploit village resources. Legends of El Dorado that reached
Spaniard explorers continued to fuel exploration and raiding of Indian
villages.

In the 17th century, Spanish conquerors explored Colombia and made the first
settlements, and this was the beginning of Colombia's modern economic history.
Major conquistadors from this period were Pedro de Heredia, Gonzalo Jimenez de
Quesada, Sebastián de Belalcazar, and Nikolaus Federmann.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the colonial settlements in Colombia
served purposes of extraction of precious metals and other natural resources,
and later slavery trade. This economic arrangement left the Colony with little
room for building solid institutionality for economic development. The main
non-extractive institutions emerging in this centuries were the fortified port
of Cartagena and the Viceroyalty of New Granada. Cartagena developed military
defenses mainly out of necessity from frequently having to deal with pirate
attacks. A primitive form of colonial administration was organized in Santa fé
de Bogotá with the Viceroyalty of New Granada, especially under the tenure of
José Solís Folch de Cardona (1753–1761), who conducted a census and built
roads, bridges and aqueducts.

Following the Thousand Days' War (1899–1902), Colombia experienced a coffee
boom that catapulted the country into the modern period, bringing the
attendant benefits of transportation, particularly railroads, communications
infrastructure, and the first major attempts at manufacturing.

### 20th century

Colombia's consistently sound economic policies and aggressive promotion of
free trade agreements in recent years have bolstered its ability to weather
external shocks. Real GDP has grown more than 4% per year for the past three
years, continuing almost a decade of strong economic performance.

In 1990, the administration of President César Gaviria Trujillo (1990–94)
initiated economic liberalism policies or "apertura economica" and this has
continued since then, with tariff reductions, financial deregulation,
privatization of state-owned enterprises, and adoption of a more liberal
foreign exchange rate. Almost all sectors became open to foreign investment
although agricultural products remained protected.

The original idea of his then Minister of Finance, Rudolf Homes, was that the
country should import agricultural products in which it was not competitive,
like maize, wheat, cotton and soybeans and export the ones in which it had an
advantage, like fruits and flowers. In ten years, the sector lost 7,000 km2 to
imports, with a critical impact on employment in rural areas. Still, this
policy makes food cheaper for the average Colombian than it would be if
agricultural trade were more restricted.

Until 1997, Colombia had enjoyed a fairly stable economy. The first five years
of liberalization were characterized by high economic growth rates of between
4% and 5%. The Ernesto Samper administration (1994–98) emphasized social
welfare policies which targeted Colombia's lower income population. These
reforms led to higher government spending which increased the fiscal deficit
and public sector debt, the financing of which required higher interest rates.
An over-valued peso inherited from the previous administration was maintained.

The economy slowed, and by 1998 GDP growth was only 0.6%. In 1999, the country
fell into its first recession since the Great Depression. The economy shrank
by 4.5% with unemployment at over 20%. While unemployment remained at 20% in
2000, GDP growth recovered to 3.1%. Unemployment in 2020 has improved compared
to two decades ago to 12.20%.

The administration of President Andrés Pastrana Arango, when it took office on
7 August 1998, faced an economy in crisis, with the difficult internal
security situation and global economic turbulence additionally inhibiting
confidence. As evidence of a serious recession became clear in 1999, the
government took a number of steps. It engaged in a series of controlled
devaluations of the peso, followed by a decision to let it float. Colombia
also entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund which
provided a $2.7 billion guarantee (extended funds facility), while committing
the government to budget discipline and structural reforms.

### 21st century

By early 2000 there had been the beginning of an economic recovery, with the
export sector leading the way, as it enjoyed the benefit of the more
competitive exchange rate, as well as strong prices for petroleum, Colombia's
leading export product. Prices of coffee, the other principal export product,
have been more variable.

Economic growth reached 3.1% during 2000 and inflation 9.0%. Inflation by 2021
has stabilized at 3.30%. Colombia's international reserves remained stable at
around $8.35 billion in the year 2000 growing to $58.57 billion by 2021, and
Colombia has successfully remained in international capital markets.
Colombia's total foreign debt at the end of 1999 was $34.5 billion with $14.7
billion in private sector and $19.8 billion in public sector debt. Major
international credit rating organizations had dropped Colombian sovereign debt
below investment grade, primarily as a result of large fiscal deficits, which
current policies are seeking to close. As of 2021 Colombia has recovered its
investment grade rating.

Former president Álvaro Uribe (elected 7 August 2002) introduced several
neoliberal economic reforms, including measures designed to reduce the public-
sector deficit below 2.5% of GDP in 2004. The government's economic policy and
controversial democratic security strategy have engendered a growing sense of
confidence in the economy, particularly within the business sector, and GDP
growth in 2003 was among the highest in Latin America, at over 4%. This growth
rate was maintained over the next decade, averaging 4.8% from 2004 to 2014.

According to figures from Dane, monetary poverty went from 37.2% in 2010 to
26.9% in 2017, which indicates a higher income for the most vulnerable
households. During the Santos government, there was an inflationary period
that was also a response to the strong external shock of the fall in oil
prices. It was a period of contained instability, although inflation
increased, no company declared bankruptcy and there was no instability in the
financial system.

The Santos period managed an increase in GDP of 4% in 2010, which peaked in
2011 to 6.6%. Thereafter it remained at 4% in 2012, 4.9% in 2013 and 4.4% in
2014. In 2011, Colombia recovered its BBB− investment grade, which was raised
in 2013 to BBB. As a result of sustained growth, during the eight years of the
Santos government, 3.5 million jobs were created, while 5.4 million people
were lifted out of poverty.

The focus of Santos' second term was to reach a peace agreement with the FARC
whose economic effects, according to assumptions, could imply a GDP growth of
up to two additional percentage points. Santos' best legacy is precisely the
one related to security since this will have an effect in the medium and long
term in terms of investment decisions, job creation, and the beginning of a
great revolution in the country's infrastructure: war prevented development in
the most affected areas for centuries.

Colombia's President Iván Duque withdrew a controversial tax reform bill
following four weeks of huge protests across the country starting 28 April
2021. In 2021, Colombia registered an increase in Gross Domestic Product of
more than 10%, as a result of a rebound effect that derived from the 6.8%
collapse a year earlier, caused by the economic closures decreed to stop the
coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic exacerbated poverty. In 2021, official
figures showed that 39% of Colombians – out of a population of 51.6 million
inhabitants – were in a condition of monetary poverty. Although it shows a
slight improvement compared to 2020 (42.5%), it meant a setback of at least a
decade.

The greatest increase in the value of the debt also occurred in the Duque
government, according to figures from the Bank of the Republic. Between 2020
and 2021 the balance increased by 17 billion dollars, and from 2019 to 2020 it
increased by 16 billion. That figure, which corresponds to a deficit of 7.1
percent of GDP, was the debt that the Central National Government or GNC (the
State without its companies or regional entities) had in 2021, according to
the fiscal closing bulletin.

In the Duque government, specifically between May and June 2020, 66.7 percent
of the country's gold reserves were sold, which went from 710.5 to 237.4
million dollars. The decision was made by the Bank of the Republic. The sale
received criticism because although it was done at a time of rising prices –
after five years in which this did not happen – it was before gold reached a
record price.

The COVID-19 recession had a profound impact on Colombia's economy, with
significant disruptions to GDP components, unemployment, and inflation.
Household consumption, which is a key driver of the economy, saw the sharpest
decline, dropping by 20% in the second quarter of 2020 due to lockdowns,
income uncertainty, and limited mobility. Despite a partial recovery in Q3
2020, high unemployment (peaking at 19.9%) and ongoing uncertainties slowed
the recovery of consumer spending. Investment also decreased during the
pandemic, with businesses reducing capital expenditures amid uncertainty
(-31.6%). Although investment exhibited a significant recovery in Q3 2020,
reaching 26%, the drop in global demand for Colombia's exports—particularly
oil and coal—influenced a slow recovery as indicated by 10% growth rate of
real GDP following a 16% trough. Government spending rose in response to the
pandemic, driven by fiscal stimulus and social aid programs, helping to
stabilize the economy.

The deterioration of the labor market severely affected sectors such as
retail, hospitality, and informal employment, deepening the economic
contraction. Although unemployment gradually decreased to 14.75% by early
2021, it stayed significantly above the pre-pandemic levels. Inflation, on the
other hand, remained low in Q1 2020, but turned into deflation for the
remaining of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, signaling a significant
weakened aggregate demand. Overall, Colombia's real GDP contracted by about
16% in Q2 2020, due to declines in household consumption and investment. While
there were modest signs of recovery by early 2021, the combination of high
unemployment and deflation continued to hinder the full economic rebound.

---|---  
  
In the early 21st century, the Colombian economy grew in part because of
austere government budgets, focused efforts to reduce public debt levels, an
export-oriented growth strategy, an improved security situation in the
country, and high commodity prices. Growth slowed to 1.4 percent in 2017, and
then increased to 3.3 percent in 2019.

President Uribe, who was in office from 2002 to 2010, examined opportunities
including reforming the pension system, reducing high unemployment, achieving
congressional passage of a fiscal transfers reform, and exploring for new oil
or producing ethanol. Colombia's Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality,
was one of the highest in South America. International and domestic financial
analysts warned of the growing central government deficit, which hovered at 5%
of GDP. Nonetheless, confidence in the economy grew.

The middle class will represent 25% of the population in 2020 according to a
survey by the daily newspaper _El Tiempo_. Official data indicate that 42.5%
of the population lives below the poverty line. The social elevator is one of
the slowest in the world, as it takes an average of eleven generations for a
family to rise out of poverty.

The tax system is one of the causes of Colombia's deep social inequalities.
The income tax (IRPP) is not very progressive (almost all taxpayers pay it at
a rate of between 19% and 28%, and the rate rises only slightly thereafter)
and is levied mainly on salaries, with other categories of income being
largely underreported. Redistribution through the Colombian tax system is thus
the lowest in Latin America, even though it is on average very limited.

Colombia – macroeconomic indicators 2002–2011

## Labor rights

On 8 June 2020, the newly formed Employment Mission _(Misión de Empleo)_ met
for the first time to discuss labor reforms that it intended to propose to
Congress. Some of these reforms had been desired for years, and others had
come into starker view during the coronavirus pandemic.

The legal working hours are 48 hours per week. However, the informal economy
accounts for almost half of the workers, who are therefore not covered by
labor laws.

## Agriculture

Palm plantation in Magdalena. Colombia is one of the top five producers of
palm oil in the world. Sugar cane in Valle del Cauca. Colombia is one of the
top 10 sugarcane producers in the world.

Colombia is one of the five largest producers in the world of coffee, avocado
and palm oil, and one of the 10 largest producers in the world of sugarcane,
banana, pineapple and cocoa.

Colombia produced, in 2018, 36.2 million tons of sugarcane (7th largest
producer in the world), 5.8 million tons of palm oil (5th largest producer in
the world), 3.7 million tons of banana (11th largest producer in the world)
and 720 thousand tons of coffee (4th largest producer in the world, behind
Brazil, Vietnam and Indonesia). Although its neighbor Brazil is the largest
producer of coffee in the world (3.5 million tons produced in the same year),
the advertising carried out by the country for decades suggests that Colombian
coffee is of higher quality, which generates greater added value to the
country's product. In the same year, Colombia produced 3.3 million tons of
rice, 3.1 million tons of potato, 2.2 million tons of cassava, 1.3 million
tons of maize, 900 thousand tons of pineapple, 670 thousand tons of onion, 527
thousand tons of tomato, 419 thousand tons of yam, 338 thousand tons of mango,
326 thousand tons of avocado, in addition to smaller productions of other
agricultural products such as orange, tangerine, lemon, papaya, beans, carrot,
coconut, watermelon etc. As of October 2024, Colombia is the tenth largest
producer of cacao in the global market. Its top importers include the United
States, Chile, Ecuador, and Venezuela.

The share of agriculture in GDP has fallen consistently since 1945, as
industry and services have expanded. However, Colombia's agricultural share of
GDP decreased during the 1990s by less than in many of the world's countries
at a similar level of development, even though the share of coffee in GDP
diminished in a dramatic way. Agriculture has nevertheless remained an
important source of employment, providing a fifth of Colombia's jobs in 2006.

Agriculture in Colombia is particularly vulnerable to climate-induced events
like La Niña, leading to droughts and heavy rains. Soil aridity, erosion, and
desertification are already pressing issues in Colombian agriculture, expected
to worsen with climate change. Despite representing only 0.4 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions, 71.3 percent of Colombia's domestic emissions stem
from agriculture and land use. Colombia's revised National Determined
Contributions (NDCs) aim to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030, with a focus on
agriculture. Strategies include reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cocoa,
rice, coffee, forestry, and cattle production. The country also aims to
provide agroclimatic information to 1 million producers by 2030.

## Livestock

Livestock in Córdoba. Colombia is one of the 20 largest producers of beef in
the world.

In the production of beef and chicken meat, Colombia is among the 20 largest
producers in the world.

In Colombia, the exploitation and breeding of cattle is carried out on small
farms and large farms. Black-eared white, casanareño, coastal with horns,
romosinuano, chino santandereano and hartón del Valle, are the Colombian
breeds with the highest production.

In 2013, livestock occupied 80% of productive land in Colombia. The livestock
sector is one of the most outstanding in areas such as Caribbean Region, where
seven departments have livestock as their primary vocation. Also in Antioquia,
where there is the largest cattle inventory in the country, the department had
that year 11% of the head of cattle in Colombia, and according to the
livestock inventory, in 2012 Antioqueños counted around 2,268,000 head of
cattle.

Also in 2013, the bovine herd in Colombia reached 20.1 million head of cattle,
of which 2.5 million (12.5%) were milking cows. In addition, the country's
total milk production was 13.1 million liters.

On the other hand, the increase in imports of pork meat, the high prices of
inputs and the slowdown in the national economy, produced a crisis in the
raising of pork in Colombia in 2015.

## Industry

The World Bank lists the main producing countries each year, based on the
total value of production. According to the 2019 list, Colombia has the 46th
most valuable industry in the world (US$35.4 billion), behind Mexico, Brazil,
Venezuela and Argentina, but ahead of Peru and Chile.

### Manufacturing

#### Domestic appliances

Although Colombia has been producing domestic appliances since the 1930s, it
wasn't until the late 1990s that Colombian corporations began exporting to
neighboring countries. One of Colombia's largest producers of domestic
appliances, HACEB has been producing refrigeration since 1940. Some domestic
corporations include: Challenger, Kalley, HACEB, Imusa, and Landers. In 2011,
Groupe SEB acquired Imusa as a form to expand to the Latin American market.
Colombia also manufactures for foreign companies as well, such as Whirlpool
and GE. LG has also been interested in building a plant in Colombia. Colombia
is also Latin America's 3rd largest producer of appliances behind Mexico and
Brazil and is growing rapidly.

#### Electronics

Colombia is a major producer of electronics in Latin America, and is South
America's 2nd largest high-tech market. Colombia is also the 2nd largest
producer and exporter of electronics made by domestic companies in Latin
America. Since the early 2000s, major Colombian corporations began exporting
aggressively to foreign markets. Some of these companies include: Challenger,
PcSmart, Compumax, Colcircuirtos, and Kalley. Colombia is the first country in
Latin America to manufacture a domestically made 4K television. In 2014, the
Colombian Government launched a national campaign to promote IT and Electronic
sectors, as well as investing in Colombia's own companies. Although innovation
remains low on the global scale, the government sees heavy potential in the
high tech industry and is investing heavily in education and innovation
centers all across the nation. Because of this, Colombia could become a major
global manufacturer of electronics and play an important role in the global
high tech industry in the near future. In 2014, the Colombian government
released another national campaign to help Colombian companies have a bigger
share of the national market.

#### Construction

Construction recently[_when?_]has played a vital role in the economy, and is
growing rapidly at almost 20% annually. As a result, Colombia is seeing a
historic building boom. The Colombian government is investing heavily in
transport infrastructure through a plan called "Fourth Generation Network".
The target of the Colombian government is to build 7,000 km of roads for the
2016–2020 period and reduce travel times by 30% and transport costs by 20%. A
toll road concession program will comprise 40 projects, and is part of a
larger strategic goal to invest nearly $50bn in transport infrastructure,
including: railway systems; making the Magdalena river navigable again;
improving port facilities; as well as an expansion of Bogotá's airport. Long-
term plans include building a national high-speed train network, to vastly
improve competitiveness.

### Utilities

## Mining and energy

Emeralds are one of the most valuable and exported natural products in the
country.

Colombia is well-endowed with minerals and energy resources. It has the
largest coal reserves in Latin America, and is second to Brazil in
hydroelectric potential. Estimates of petroleum reserves in 1995 were 3.1
billion barrels (490,000,000 m3). It also possesses significant amounts of
nickel, gold, silver, platinum, and emeralds.

The country was the 12th largest producer of coal in the world in 2018. In
2019, Colombia was the 20th largest petroleum producer in the world, with 791
thousand barrels / day. In mining, Colombia is the world's largest producer of
emerald.

The discovery of 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3) of high-quality oil at the
Cusiana and Cupiagua fields, about 200 kilometres (120 mi) east of Bogotá, has
enabled Colombia to become a net oil exporter since 1986. The Transandino
pipeline transports oil from Orito in the Department of Putumayo to the
Pacific port of Tumaco in the Department of Nariño. Total crude oil production
averages 620 thousand barrels per day (99,000 m3/d); about 184 thousand
barrels per day (29,300 m3/d) is exported. The Pastrana government has
significantly liberalized its petroleum investment policies, leading to an
increase in exploration activity. Refining capacity cannot satisfy domestic
demand, so some refined products, especially gasoline, must be imported. Plans
for the construction of a new refinery are under development.

While Colombia has vast hydroelectric potential, a prolonged drought in 1992
forced severe electricity rationing throughout the country until mid-1993. The
consequences of the drought on electricity-generating capacity caused the
government to commission the construction or upgrading of ten thermoelectric
power plants. Half will be coal-fired, and half will be fired by natural gas.
The government also has begun awarding bids for the construction of a natural
gas pipeline system that will extend from the country's extensive gas fields
to its major population centers. Plans call for this project to make natural
gas available to millions of Colombian households by the middle of the next
decade.

As of 2004, Colombia has become a net energy exporter, exporting electricity
to Ecuador and developing connections to Peru, Venezuela and Panama to export
to those markets as well. The Trans-Caribbean pipeline connecting western
Venezuela to Panama through Colombia is also under construction, thanks to
cooperation between presidents Álvaro Uribe of Colombia, Martín Torrijos of
Panama and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Coal is exported to Turkey.

Oil and coal account for 47% of goods exports in 2021.

### Human rights abuses in mining zones

The oil pipelines are a frequent target of extortion and bombing campaigns by
the National Liberation Army (ELN) and, more recently, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC).[_citation needed_] The bombings, which have
occurred on average once every 5 days, have caused substantial environmental
damage, often in fragile rainforests and jungles, as well as causing
significant loss of life.[_citation needed_] In April 1999 in Cartagena de
Indias, Clinton's Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson spoke before investors
from the United States, Canada and other countries. He expressed his
government's willingness to use military aid to support the investment that
they and their allies were going to make in Colombia, especially in
strategically important sectors like mining and energy.[_citation needed_]

In 2001 there were 170 attacks on the Caño Limón–Coveñas pipeline. The
pipeline was out of operation for over 200 days of that year; the government
estimates that these bombings reduced Colombia's GDP by 0.5%.[_citation
needed_] The government of the United States increased military aid, in 2003,
to Colombia to assist in the effort to defend the pipeline. Occidental
Petroleum privately contracted mercenaries who flew Skymaster planes, from
AirScan International Inc., to patrol the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline. Many of
these operations used helicopters, equipment and weapons provided by the U.S.
military and anti-narcotics aid programs.[_citation needed_]

Mining and natural exploitation has had environmental consequences. The region
of Guajira is undergoing an accelerated desertification with the
disappearances of forests, land, and water sources, due to the increase in
coal production. Social consequences or lack of development in resource rich
areas is common. 11 million Colombians survive on less than one dollar a day.
Over 65% of these live in mining zones. There are 3.5 million children out of
school, and the most critical situation is in the mining zone of Choco,
Bolivar, and Sucre.[_citation needed_]

Economic consequences of privatization and liberal institutions have meant
changes in taxation to attract foreign investment. Colombia will lose another
$800 million over the next 90 years that Glencore International operates in El
Cerrejon Zona Media, if the company continues to produce coal at a rate of 5
million tons/year, because of the reduction of the royalty tax from 10 to 15%
to .04%.[_citation needed_] If the company, as is plausible, doubles or
triples its production, the losses will be proportionally greater.[_citation
needed_] The operational losses from the three large mining projects (El
Cerrejon, La Loma, operated by Drummond, and Montelíbano, which produces
ferronickel) for Colombia to more than 12 billion. [_citation needed_]

Coal production has grown rapidly, from 22.7 million tons in 1994 to 50.0
million tons in 2003. Over 90% of this amount was exported, making Colombia
the world's sixth largest coal exporter, behind Australia, China, Indonesia,
South Africa and Russia. From the mid-1980s the center of coal production was
the Cerrejón mines in the Guajira department.[_citation needed_] However, the
growth in output at La Loma in neighboring Cesar Department made this area the
leader in Colombian coal production since 2004.[_citation needed_] Production
in other departments, including Boyacá, Cundinamarca and Norte de Santander,
forms about 13% of the total.[_citation needed_] The coal industry is largely
controlled by international mining companies, including a consortium of BHP,
Anglo American and Glencore at Cerrejón, and Conundrum Company at La Loma,
which is undergoing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Alabama for union
assassinations and alleged paramilitary links.[_citation needed_]

## Foreign investment

Various attempts to open up the economy during the 1993-2023 period have been
described by Portafolio as being "half-hearted". In 1990, to attract foreign
investors and promote trade, an experiment from the International Monetary
Fund known as "La Apertura" was adopted by the government, this policy was to
modernize different sectors of the economy to increase the overall efficiency
of production so as to bring down prices to internationally competitive
levels. Although the analyses of the results are not clear,[_citation needed_]
the fact is that the agricultural sector was severely impacted by this policy.

In 1991 and 1992, the government passed laws to stimulate foreign investment
in nearly all sectors of the economy. The only activities closed to foreign
direct investment are defense and national security, disposal of hazardous
wastes, and real estate—the last of these restrictions is intended to hinder
money laundering. Colombia established a special entity—Converter—to assist
foreigners in making investments in the country. Foreign investment flows for
1999 were $4.4 billion, down from $4.8 billion in 1998.

Major foreign investment projects underway include the $6 billion development
of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields, development of coal fields in the
north of the country, and the recently concluded licensing for establishment
of cellular telephone service. The United States accounted for 26.5% of the
total $19.4 billion stock of non-petroleum foreign direct investment in
Colombia at the end of 1998.

On 21 October 1995, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act
(IEEPA), President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring U.S. entities
from any commercial or financial transactions with four Colombian drug
kingpins and with individuals and companies associated with the traffic in
narcotics, as designated by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with
the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. The list of designated
individuals and companies is amended periodically and is maintained by the
Office of Foreign Asset Control at the Department of the Treasury, tel. (202)
622-0077 (ask for Document #1900). The document also is available at the
Department of Treasury website.

Colombia is the United States' fifth-largest export market in Latin
America—behind Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina—and the 26th-largest
market for U.S. products worldwide. The United States is Colombia's principal
trading partner, with two-way trade from November 1999 through November 2000
exceeding $9.5 billion--$3.5 billion U.S. exports and $6.0 billion U.S.
imports. Colombia benefits from duty-free entry—for a 10-year period, through
2001—for certain of its exports to the United States under the Andean Trade
Preferences Act. Colombia improved protection of intellectual property rights
through the adoption of three Andean Pact decisions in 1993 and 1994, but the
U.S. remains concerned over deficiencies in licensing, patent regulations, and
copyright protection.

Colombia is also the largest export partner of the Dutch constituent country
of Aruba (39.4%).

The petroleum and natural gas coal mining, chemical, and manufacturing
industries attract the greatest U.S. investment interest. U.S. investment
accounted for 37.8% ($4.2 billion) of the total $11.2 billion in foreign
direct investment at the end of 1997, excluding petroleum and portfolio
investment. Worker rights and benefits in the U.S.-dominated sectors are more
favorable than general working conditions. Examples include shorter-than-
average working hours, higher wages, and compliance with health and safety
standards above the national average.

## Tertiary industries

The services sector dominates Colombia's GDP, contributing 58 percent of GDP
in 2007, and, given worldwide trends, its dominance will probably continue.
The sector is characterized by its heterogeneity, being the largest for
employment (61 percent), in both the formal and informal sectors.

### Arts and music

Since the early 2010s, the Colombian government has shown interest in
exporting modern Colombian pop culture to the world (which includes video
games, music, movies, TV shows, fashion, cosmetics, and food) as a way of
diversifying the economy and changing the image of Colombia. In the Hispanic
world, Colombia is only behind Mexico in cultural exports at US$750 million
annually, and is already a regional leader in cosmetic and beauty exports.

### Travel and tourism

Tourism in Colombia is an important sector in the country's economy.[_citation
needed_] Colombia has major attractions as a tourist destination, such as
Cartagena and its historic surroundings, which are on the UNESCO World
Heritage List; the insular department of San Andrés, Providencia y Santa
Catalina; Santa Marta, Cartagena and the surrounding area. Fairly recently,
Bogotá, the nation's capital, has become Colombia's major tourist destination
because of its improved museums and entertainment facilities and its major
urban renovations, including the rehabilitation of public areas, the
development of parks, and the creation of an extensive network of cycling
routes. With its very rich and varied geography, which includes the Amazon and
Andean regions, the llanos, the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, and the deserts
of La Guajira, and its unique biodiversity, Colombia also has major potential
for ecotourism.

The direct contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP in 2013 was COP11,974.3mn
(1.7% of GDP). This is forecast to rise by 7.4% to COP12,863.4mn in 2014. This
primarily reflects the economic activity generated by industries such as
hotels, travel agents, airlines and other passenger transportation services
(excluding commuter services). But it also includes, for example, the
activities of the restaurant and leisure industries directly supported by
tourists. The direct contribution of Travel & Tourism to GDP is expected to
grow by 4.1% pa to COP19,208.4mn (1.8% of GDP) by 2024.

The number of tourists in Colombia grows by over 12% every year. Colombia is
projected to have over 15 million tourists by 2023.

#### Eco-tourism

Eco-tourism is very promising in Colombia. Colombia has vast coastlines,
mountainous areas, and tropical jungles. There are volcanoes and waterfalls as
well. This makes Colombia a biodiverse country with many attractions for
foreign visitors.

The Colombian coffee growing axis (Spanish: Eje Cafetero), also known as the
Coffee Triangle (Spanish: Triángulo del Café), is a part of the Colombian
Paisa region in the rural area of Colombia, which is famous for growing and
production of a majority of Colombian coffee, considered by some as the best
coffee in the world. There are three departments in the area: Caldas, Quindío
and Risaralda. These departments are among the smallest departments in
Colombia with a total combined area of 13,873 km2 (5,356 sq mi), about 1.2% of
the Colombian territory. The combined population is 2,291,195 (2005 census).

### Transportation and telecommunications

Colombia's geography, with three cordilleras of the Andes running up the
country from south to north, and jungle in the Amazon and Darién regions,
represents a major obstacle to the development of national road networks with
international connections. Thus, the basic nature of the country's
transportation infrastructure is not surprising. In the spirit of the 1991
constitution, in 1993 the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation was
reorganized and renamed the Ministry of Transportation. In 2000 the new
ministry strengthened its role as the planner and regulator within the sector.

#### Air transportation

Colombia was a pioneer in promoting airlines in an effort to overcome its
geographic barriers to transportation. The Colombian Company of Air
Navigation, formed in 1919, was the second commercial airline in the world. It
was not until the 1940s that Colombia's air transportation began growing
significantly in the number of companies, passengers carried, and kilometers
covered. In the early 2000s, an average of 72 percent of the passengers
transported by air go to national destinations, while 28 percent travel
internationally. One notable feature is that after the reforms of the
beginning of the 1990s, the number of international passengers tripled by
2003. In 1993 the construction, administration, operation, and maintenance of
the main airports transferred to departmental authorities and the private
sector, including companies specializing in air transportation. Within this
process, in 2006 the International Airport Operator (Opain), a Swiss-Colombian
consortium, won the concession to manage and develop Bogotá's El Dorado
International Airport. El Dorado is the largest airport in Latin America in
terms of cargo traffic (33rd worldwide), with 622,145 metric tons in 2013,
second in terms of traffic movements (45th worldwide) and third in terms of
passengers (50th among the busiest airports in the world). In addition to El
Dorado, Colombia's international airports are Palo Negro in Bucaramanga, Simón
Bolívar in Santa Marta, Cortissoz in Barranquilla, Rafael Núñez in Cartagena,
José María Córdova in Rionegro near Medellín, Alfonso Bonilla Aragón in Cali,
Alfredo Vásquez Cobo in Leticia, Matecaña in Pereira, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla in
San Andrés, and Camilo Daza in Cúcuta. In 2006 Colombia was generally reported
to have a total of 984 airports, of which 103 had paved runways and 883 were
unpaved. The Ministry of Transportation listed 581 airports in 2007, but it
may have used a different methodology for counting them.

#### Poverty and inequality

After a large crisis in 1999, poverty in Colombia has had a decreasing trend.
The share of Colombians below the income-based poverty line fell from 50% in
2002 to 28% in 2016. The share of Colombians below the extreme income-based
poverty line fell from 18% to 9% in the same period. Multidimensional poverty
fell from 30% to 18% between 2010 and 2016.

Colombia has a Gini coefficient of 51.7.

### Retail

Hypermarkets and big-box stores are losing market participation in Colombian
retail.

## Debt

Between 1976 and 2006, Colombia's debt doubled every 10 years: in 1976 it was
about $3.6 billion, in 1986 it was $7.2 billion, in 1996 it was over $16
billion and in 2006 it was over $36 billion. Since 2006, the growth of the
debt has accelerated: it reached $72 billion in 2011 and reached $124 billion
in 2017, which means that in less than 10 years Colombia's foreign debt has
tripled. About a quarter of Colombia's annual budget, or $20 billion, goes to
pay off the public debt.

## Corruption

Corruption in public management in Colombia is widespread and structural in
nature. This situation generates losses for the country estimated at 15
billion dollars. Colombia has not escaped the scandals involving millions of
dollars in bribes from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, as well
as the Cartagena refinery, a case of embezzlement of public funds that came to
light in 2016 and involved members of the governments of Álvaro Uribe
(2002–2010) and Juan Manuel Santos (2010–2018).
