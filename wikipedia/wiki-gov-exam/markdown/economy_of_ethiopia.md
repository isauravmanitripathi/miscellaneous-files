The **economy of Ethiopia** is a mixed and transition economy with a large
public sector. The government of Ethiopia is in the process of privatizing
many of the state-owned businesses and moving toward a market economy. The
banking, telecommunication and transportation sectors of the economy are
dominated by government-owned companies.

Ethiopia has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is Africa's
second most populous country. Many properties owned by the government during
the previous regime have now been privatized or are in the process of
privatization and the liberalization of its financial sector in the near
future. However, certain sectors such as telecommunications, financial and
insurance services, air and land transportation services, and retail, are
considered to be strategic sectors and are expected to remain under state
control for the foreseeable future.

Almost 50% of Ethiopia's population is under the age of 18. Even though
education enrollment at primary and tertiary level has increased
significantly, job creation has not caught up with the increased number of
secondary and postsecondary educational graduates. The country must create
hundreds of thousands of jobs every year just to keep up with population
growth.

In 2023, Ethiopia reached an estimated GDP of 156.1 billion nominal dollars
and an estimated PPP of 393.85 billion dollars. This mostly comes from a
services-based economy with agriculture. In the latest data from 2019
Ethiopia's top trading partners globally included China, the United States,
UAE, France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, India, and Egypt. In 2021,
agriculture made up 37.5% of the country's economic output, while services
36.25% and industry made up 21.85% of the economy. Ethiopia's economy is
ranked 159th place out of 190 countries in 'Ease of doing business'. Ethiopia
is also a part of African Continental Free Trade Area, Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa, Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and
the G24, and has observer status at the World Trade Organization. Ethiopia
joined the BRICS economic alliance in January 2024.

While Ethiopia does not currently have a stock exchange, it did have one in
the past during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, called an 'ākisīyoni
gebeya.' It now has a commodity exchange in Addis Ababa called the Ethiopia
Commodity Exchange, established in 2008.

The Ethiopian economy has a large foreign debt, with an overall external debt
of 28 billion US dollars. China owns over 13 billion dollars of its debt. Its
debt to GDP ratio is smaller than similar and neighboring countries. Ethiopia
currently has 2.4 billion dollars of foreign reserves, representing a decline
compared to previous years.

Ethiopia expects to reach a national middle-income status by 2025. Despite
this, based on the most recent data from 2019, 68.7% of the population
continues to be affected by multidimensional poverty and an additional 18.4%
vulnerable to it.

## History

Development of GDP per capita

Ethiopia's resources have enabled the country—unlike most sub-Saharan African
countries—to maintain contacts with the outside world for centuries. Since
ancient times, Ethiopian traders exchanged gold, ivory, musk, and wild animal
skins for salt and luxury goods, such as silk and velvet. By the late
nineteenth century, coffee had become one of Ethiopia's more important cash
crops. At that time, most trade flowed along two major trade routes, both of
which terminated in the far southwest in the Kefa-Jima region. From there, one
route went north to Mitsiwa via Gonder and Adwa, the other along the Awash
River valley to Harer and then on to Berbera or Zeila on the Red Sea.

Ethiopia lost its status as a great trading state after the fall of Axum. Most
Ethiopians came to despise traders, preferring instead to emulate the
country's legendary warriors and priests. After establishing a foothold in the
country, Greek, Armenian, and Arab traders became the economic intermediaries
between Ethiopia and the outside world. Arabs also settled in the interior and
eventually dominated all commercial activity except petty trade.

When their occupation of Ethiopia ended in 1941, the Italians left behind them
a country whose economic structure was much as it had been for centuries.
There had been some improvements in communications, particularly in the area
of road building, and attempts had been made to establish a few small
industries and to introduce commercial farming, particularly in Eritrea, which
Italy had occupied since 1890. But these changes were limited. With only a
small proportion of the population participating in the monetized economy,
trade consisted mostly of barter. Wage labor was limited, economic units were
largely self-sufficient, foreign trade was negligible, and the market for
manufactured goods was extremely small.

During the late 1940s and 1950s, much of the economy remained unchanged. The
government focused its development efforts on expansion of the bureaucratic
structure and ancillary services. Most farmers cultivated small plots of land
or herded cattle. Traditional and primitive farming methods provided the
population with a subsistence standard of living. In addition, many nomadic
peoples raised livestock and moved seasonally in drier areas. The agricultural
sector grew slightly, and the industrial sector represented a small part of
the total economy.

By the early 1950s, Emperor Haile Selassie I (reigned 1930–74) had renewed
calls for a transition from a subsistence economy to an agro-industrial
economy. To accomplish this task, Ethiopia needed infrastructure to develop
resources, a material base to improve living conditions, and better health,
education, communications, and other services. A key element of the emperor's
new economic policy was the adoption of centrally administered development
plans.

The First Five-Year Plan (1957–1961) sought to develop strong infrastructure,
particularly in transportation, construction, and communications, to link
isolated regions. The Second Five-Year Plan (1962–1967) signaled the start of
a 20-year program to change Ethiopia's predominantly agricultural economy to
an agro-industrial one. The Third Five-Year Plan (1968–1973) also sought to
facilitate Ethiopia's economic well-being by raising manufacturing and agro-
industrial performance. However, unlike its predecessors, the third plan
expressed the government's willingness to expand educational opportunities and
to improve peasant agriculture.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the gross national product (GNP) increased at
a 3.2 percent annual rate as opposed to the projected figure of 3.7 percent,
and growth in economic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and mining
failed to meet the national plan's targets. The Planning Commission never
assessed the performance of the Second Five-Year Plan and Third Five-Year
Plan, largely because of a shortage of qualified personnel. However, according
to data from the Ethiopian government's Central Statistical Authority, during
the 1960/61 to 1973/74 period the economy achieved sustained economic growth.
Between 1960 and 1970, Ethiopia enjoyed an annual 4.4 percent average growth
rate in per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Relative to its neighbors,
Ethiopia's economic performance was mixed.

By the early 1970s, Ethiopia's economy not only had started to grow but also
had begun to diversify into areas such as manufacturing and services. However,
these changes failed to improve the lives of most Ethiopians. About four-
fifths of the population were subsistence farmers who lived in poverty because
they used most of their meager production to pay taxes, rents, debt payments,
and bribes.

The 1974 revolution resulted in the nationalization and restructuring of the
Ethiopian economy. After the revolution, the country's economy can be viewed
as having gone through four phases. Internal political upheaval, armed
conflict, and radical institutional reform marked the 1974-78 period of the
revolution. There was little economic growth; instead, the government's
nationalization measures and the highly unstable political climate caused
economic dislocation in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. As a
result of these problems, GDP increased at an average annual rate of only 0.4
percent.

In the second phase (1978–1980), the economy began to recover as the
government consolidated power and implemented institutional reforms. More
important, security conditions improved as internal and external threats
subsided. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.7 percent.

In the third phase (1980–1985), the economy experienced a setback. Except for
Ethiopian fiscal year (EFY) 1982/83, the growth of GDP declined. Manufacturing
took a downturn as well, and agriculture reached a crisis stage, particularly
due to drought that lead to widespread famine.

In the fourth period (1985–1990), the economy continued to stagnate. GDP and
the manufacturing sector also grew during this period, GDP increasing at an
average annual rate of 5 percent. However, the lingering effects of the
1984-85 drought undercut these achievements and contributed to the economy's
overall stag.

Since 1991, the Ethiopian government has embarked on a program of economic
reform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of
government regulation. While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have
attracted foreign direct investment.

In 2015, Ethiopia has 2,700 millionaires, a number that has more than doubled
since 2007. Their fortunes are mainly built-in niches of economic rents
(banks, mines, etc.) without investing in structural and strategic sectors
(industrial production, infrastructure, etc.) and should in no way promote
economic development or represent a source of competition for Western
multinationals.

The Ethiopian government is stepping up its efforts to attract foreign
investors, particularly in the textile sector. They can now import their
machines without customs duties, benefit from a tax exemption for ten years,
pay rents much lower than market prices, and use very inexpensive water and
electricity. Major brands have established themselves in the country, such as
Decathlon, H&M, and Huajian. These companies also benefit from a cheap labor
force, with a monthly salary of around 35 euros. Finally, trade agreements
between Ethiopia and the European Union allow them to export duty-free.

## Sectors

### Agriculture, forestry and fishing

Coffee sorting process is huge since Ethiopia exports over a billion dollars'
worth of coffee globally Map of economic activities in Ethiopia and Eritrea
(1976)

As of 2023[update], agriculture accounts for almost 36% of GDP, 81 percent of
exports, and 73 percent of the labour force. Many other economic activities
depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of
agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly of a subsistence nature,
and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural
cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, pulses (e.g., beans),
oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Exports are almost
entirely agricultural commodities, with coffee as the largest foreign exchange
earner, and its flower industry becoming a new source of revenue: for
2005/2006 (the latest year available) Ethiopia's coffee exports represented
0.9% of the world exports, and oilseeds and flowers each representing 0.5%.
Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer. In 2000, Ethiopia's
livestock contributed to 19% of total GDP.

As of 2008[update], some countries that import most of their food, such as
Saudi Arabia, have begun planning the purchase and development of large tracts
of arable land in developing countries such as Ethiopia. This land grabbing
has raised fears of food being exported to more prosperous countries while the
local population faces its own shortage.

Forest products are mainly logs used in construction. The silvicutural
products are used in construction and manufacturing, and as energy sources.
Ethiopia's fisheries are entirely fresh water, as it has no marine coastline.
Although total production has been continuously increasing since 2007, the
fishing industry is a very small part of the economy. Fishing is predominantly
artisanal. In 2014, nearly 45,000 fishermen were employed in the sector with
only 30% of them employed full-time.

In 2018, Ethiopia produced the following goods:

  * 7.3 million tons of maize (17th largest producer in the world)
  * 4.9 million tons of sorghum (4th largest producer in the world)
  * 4.2 million tons of wheat
  * 2.1 million tons of barley (17th largest producer in the world)
  * 1.8 million tons of sweet potato (5th largest producer in the world)
  * 1.4 million tons of sugar cane
  * 1.3 million tons of yam (5th largest producer in the world)
  * 988 thousand tons of broad bean
  * 982 thousand tons of millet
  * 743 thousand tons of potato
  * 599 thousand tons of vegetable
  * 515 thousand tons of chick pea (6th largest producer in the world)
  * 508 thousand tons of banana
  * 470 thousand tons of coffee (6th largest producer in the world)
  * 446 thousand tons of cabbage
  * 374 thousand tons of pea (20th largest producer in the world)
  * 322 thousand tons of onion
  * 301 thousand tons of sesame seed (7th largest producer in the world)
  * 294 thousand tons of bell pepper
  * 172 thousand tons of lentil (11th largest producer in the world)
  * 144 thousand tons of rice
  * 143 thousand tons of peanut
  * 140 thousand tons of cotton
  * 124 thousand tons of garlic
  * 102 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava)
  * 101 thousand tons of linseed (7th largest producer in the world)

### Textile industry

Employees of Ethiopian garment factories, who work for brands such as Guess,
H&M or Calvin Klein, receive a monthly salary of 26 dollars per month. These
very low wages have led to low productivity, frequent strikes and high
turnover. Some factories have replaced all their employees on average every 12
months, according to a 2019 report of the Stern Centre for Business and Human
Rights at New York University.

### Minerals and mining

Microcline from the Kenticha mine, Oromia Region, Ethiopia.

Mining is important to the economy of Ethiopia as a diversification from
agriculture. Currently, mining comprises only 1% of GDP. Gold, gemstones
(diamonds and sapphires), and industrial minerals are important commodities
for the country's export-oriented growth strategy.

The country has deposits of coal, opal, gemstones, kaolin, iron ore, soda ash,
and tantalum, but only gold is mined in significant quantities. In Salt
extraction from salt beds in the Afar Depression, as well as from salt springs
in Dire and Afder districts in the south, is only of internal importance and
only a negligible amount is exported.

Tantalum mining has also been profitable. It was reported that in the late
1980s, the mineral industry lacked importance given that it contributed less
than 0.2 percent of Ethiopia's GDP. Mining for gold is a key development
sector in the country. Gold export, which was just US$5 million in 2001, has
recorded a large increase to US$602 million in 2012. 2001 gold production
amounted to some 3.4 tons.

### Energy

Waterpower and forests are Ethiopia's main energy sources. The country derives
about 90 percent of its electricity needs from hydropower, which means that
electricity generation, as with agriculture, is dependent on abundant
rainfall. Present installed capacity is rated at about 2000 megawatts, with
planned expansion to 10,000 megawatts. In general, Ethiopians rely on forests
for nearly all of their energy and construction needs; the result has been
deforestation of much of the highlands during the last three decades. Ethiopia
has set out plans to invest $40 billion to 71 energy projects by 2030

Less than one-half of Ethiopia's towns and cities are connected to the
national grid. Petroleum requirements are met via imports of refined products,
although some oil is being hauled overland from Sudan. Oil exploration in
Ethiopia has been underway for decades, ever since Emperor Haile Selassie I
granted a 50-year concession to SOCONY-Vacuum in September 1945.

Recent oil and gas discoveries across East Africa have seen the region emerge
as a new player in the global oil and gas industry. As exciting as the huge
gas fields of East Africa are, however, the strong decline in oil prices and
expectations for an L-shaped recovery with low prices over the coming years
are increasingly challenging the economic viability of the industry in this
region. The reserves are estimated at 4 trillion cubic feet (110×10~~^~~ 9
m3), while exploration for gas and oil is underway in the Gambela Region
bordering South Sudan. The discoveries were expected to drive billions of
dollars in annual investment to the region over the next decade. According to
BMI estimates, the findings in the last few years are more than that of any
other region in the world, and the discoveries are expected to continue for
the next few years. However, falling global oil prices are threatening the
commercial viability of many of these gas prospects.

### Manufacturing

A program to privatize state-owned enterprises has been underway since the
late 1990s. There has been a large growth of manufacturing in Ethiopia.
Several industrial parks have been built with a focus on textiles.

### Transport

Prior to the outbreak of the 1998–2000 Eritrean–Ethiopian War, landlocked
Ethiopia mainly relied on the seaports of Asseb and Massawa in Eritrea for
international trade.

As of 2005[update], Ethiopia uses the ports of Djibouti, connected to Addis
Ababa by the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway, and to a lesser extent Port Sudan
in Sudan. In May 2005, the Ethiopian government began negotiations to use the
port of Berbera in Somaliland.

By 2030, the government expects a $74 billion investment in transportation.

#### Road

As of 2016, there are 113,066 kilometres (70,256 mi) all-weather roads.

#### Air

Ethiopian Airlines is Africa's largest and most profitable airline. It serves
132 destinations with a fleet of 141 aircraft.

#### Rail

The Ethiopian railway network has been rapidly expanding. In 2015, the first
light rail in Africa was opening in Addis Ababa. In 2017, the electric Addis
Ababa-Djibouti railway began operations. Presently, two other electric
railways are under construction: Awash-Woldiya and Woldiya-Mekelle.

### Telecommunications and technology

Telecommunications were historically provided by a state-owned monopoly, Ethio
Telecom, formerly the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation. However, on
October, 2022, Safaricom Telecommunications Ethiopia launched its
telecommunications services, becoming the first private operator in the
country.

In 2020, ministers set out a national transformation strategy called Digital
Ethiopia 2025. Its aim is to prepare the country for the development of an
economy based on digital technology.

### Tourism

The services sector consists almost entirely of tourism, with additional
economic opportunity in wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and
communications. Developed in the 1960s, tourism declined greatly during the
late 1970s and the 1980s under the military government. Recovery began in the
1990s, but growth has been constrained by the lack of suitable hotels and
other infrastructure, the impact of drought, the 1998–2000 war with Eritrea,
and the specter of terrorism. In 2002 more than 156,000 tourists entered the
country, many of them Ethiopians visiting from abroad, spending more than
US$77 million. In 2008, the number of tourists entering the country had
increased to 330,000. A decade later, in 2019, Ethiopia registered a record of
812,000 tourists visiting the country, bringing a revenue of $3.55 bn (4.2
percent of the gross national product).

year from 2010/11 to 2019/20. Ethiopia's real gross domestic product (GDP)
growth slowed down to 6.1% in 2019/20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry,
mainly construction, and services accounted for most of the growth.
Agriculture was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to
growth slightly improved in 2019/20 compared to the previous year. Private
consumption and public investment explain demand-side growth, the latter
assuming an increasingly important role.

### Poverty

Share of population in extreme poverty over time The African country of
Ethiopia has made strides towards alleviating poverty since 2000 when it was
assessed that their poverty rate was one of the greatest among all other
countries. The country has made great strides in different areas of the
Millennium Development Goals including eradicating various diseases and
decreasing the rate of child mortality. Despite these improvements, poverty is
still extremely high within the country. Based on the most recent data from
2019, 68.7% of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty and an
additional 18.4% vulnerable to it. One of the leading factors in driving down
poverty was the expansion of the agricultural sector. Poor farmers have been
able to set higher food prices to increase their sales and revenue, but this
expansion has come at a cost to the poorest citizens of the country, as they
could not afford the higher priced food. One of the biggest challenges to
alleviating this issue is changing the structure of Ethiopia's economy from an
agricultural-based economy to a more industry-based economy. The current
strategy for addressing poverty in Ethiopia is by building on existing
government systems and development programs that are already in place within
the country.

## External trade

Ethiopian exports in 2006

Until 2013, the major agricultural export crop was coffee, providing about
26.4% of Ethiopia's foreign exchange earnings. In the beginning of 2014,
oilseeds exports have been more important. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian
economy. More than 15 million people (25% of the population) derive their
livelihood from the coffee sector. Other exports include live animals, leather
and leather products, chemicals, gold, pulses, oilseeds, flowers, fruits and
vegetables and khat (or _qat_), a leafy shrub which has psychotropic qualities
when chewed. Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond
state control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade
is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle,
camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti
generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million
annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower
food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote
regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and
undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to
spread more easily throughout the region. Furthermore, the government of
Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange
revenues. Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.

Dependent on a few vulnerable crops for its foreign exchange earnings and
reliant on imported oil, Ethiopia lacks sufficient foreign exchange. The
financially conservative government has taken measures to solve this problem,
including stringent import controls and sharply reduced subsidies on retail
gasoline prices. Nevertheless, the largely subsistence economy is incapable of
supporting high military expenditures, drought relief, an ambitious
development plan, and indispensable imports such as oil; it therefore depends
on foreign assistance.

In December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 billion joint venture deal with the
Malaysian oil company, Petronas, to develop a huge natural gas field in the
Somali Region. By the year 2010, however, implementation failed to progress
and Petronas lost its license to develop the field, which is now being
invested in by Chinese company, Poly-GCL Petroleum.[_which?_] Ethiopia has
already begun exporting electricity to Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti.
Earning from this has generated US$300 million annually. After the completion
of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) total generation of exports to
neighboring countries is expected to bring in US$1 billion annually to the
economy.

The dam, which was completed in 2023, is the largest hydroelectric power plant
in Africa as well as among the 20 largest in the world.
