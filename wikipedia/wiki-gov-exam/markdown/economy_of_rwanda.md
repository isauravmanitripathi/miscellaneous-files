The **economy of Rwanda** has undergone rapid industrialisation due to a
successful governmental policy. It has a mixed economy. Since the early-2000s,
Rwanda has witnessed an economic boom, which improved the living standards of
many Rwandans. The President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, has noted his ambition to
make Rwanda the "Singapore of Africa". The industrial sector is growing,
contributing 16% of GDP in 2012.

## History

Estimated development of real GDP per capita in Rwanda, since 1950

### Before the civil war and genocide

In the 1960s and 1970s, Rwanda's prudent financial policies, coupled with
generous external aid and relatively favorable terms of trade, resulted in
sustained growth in per capita income and low inflation rates. However, when
world coffee prices fell sharply in the 1980s, growth became erratic.

Compared to an annual GDP growth rate of 6.5% from 1973 to 1980, growth slowed
to an average of 2.9% a year from 1980 through 1985 and was stagnant from 1986
to 1990. The crisis peaked in 1990 when the first measures of an IMF
structural adjustment programme were carried out. While the programme was not
fully implemented before the war, key measures such as two large devaluations
and the removal of official prices were enacted. The consequences on salaries
and purchasing power were rapid and dramatic. This crisis particularly
affected the educated elite, most of whom were employed in civil service or
state-owned enterprises.

During the 5 years of civil war that culminated in the 1994 genocide, GDP
declined in 3 out of 5 years, posting a rapid decline at more than 40% in
1994, the year of the genocide. The 9% increase in real GDP for 1995, the
first postwar year, signalled the resurgence of economic activity.

### After the genocide (1994–2005)

The 1994 genocide destroyed Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely
impoverished the population, particularly women, and eroded the country's
ability to attract private and external investment. However, Rwanda has made
significant progress in stabilizing and rehabilitating its economy. In June
1998, Rwanda signed an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the
International Monetary Fund. Rwanda has also embarked upon an ambitious
privatization programme with the World Bank.

In the immediate postwar period—mid-1994 through 1995—emergency humanitarian
assistance of more than $307.4 million was largely directed to relief efforts
in Rwanda and in the refugee camps in neighbouring countries where Rwandans
fled during the war. In 1996, humanitarian relief aid began to shift to
reconstruction and development assistance.

The United States, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, the People's
Republic of China, the World Bank, the UN Development Programme and the
European Development Fund will continue to account for the substantial aid.
Rehabilitation of government infrastructure, in particular the justice system,
was an international priority, as well as the continued repair and expansion
of infrastructure, health facilities, and schools.

After the Rwandan Genocide, the Tutsi-led government began a major programme
to improve the country's economy and reduce its dependence on subsistence
farming. The failing economy had been a major factor behind the genocide, as
was overpopulation and the resulting competition for scarce farmland and other
resources. The government focused primarily on building up its manufacturing
and service industries and eliminating barriers to trade and development.

The Government of Rwanda posted a 13% GDP growth rate in 1996 through improved
collection of tax revenues, accelerated privatization of state enterprises to
stop the drain on government resources, and continued improvement in export
crop and food production. Tea plantations and factories continue to be
rehabilitated, and coffee, always a smallholder's crop, is being more
seriously rehabilitated and tended as the farmers' sense of security returns.

Coffee production of 14,578,560 tonnes in 2000 compares to a pre-civil war
variation between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes. By 2002 tea became Rwanda's
largest export, with export earnings from tea reaching US$18 million equating
to 15,000 tonnes of dried tea. Rwanda's natural resources are limited. A small
mineral industry provides about 5% of foreign exchange earnings. Concentrates
exist of the heavy minerals cassiterite (a primary source of tin), and coltan
(used to manufacture electronic capacitors, used in consumer electronics
products such as cell phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers).

By mid-1997, up to 75% of the factories functioning before the war had
returned to production, at an average of 75% of their capacity. Investments in
the industrial sector continue to mostly be limited to the repair of existing
industrial plants. Retail trade, devastated by the war, has revived quickly,
with many new small businesses established by Rwandan returnees from Uganda,
Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Industry received little external assistance from the end of the war through
1995. Beginning in 1996–97, the government became increasingly active in
helping the industrial sector to restore production through technical and
financial assistance, including loan guarantees, economic liberalization, and
the privatization of state-owned enterprises. In early 1998, the government
set up a one-stop investment promotion centre and implemented a new investment
code that created an enabling environment for foreign and local investors. An
autonomous revenue authority also has begun operation, improving collections
and accountability.[_citation needed_]

Cassiterite production peaked at 1,000 tonnes in 1990, but was under 700
tonnes in 2000. Recorded coltan production has soared from 147 tonnes in 1999
to 1,300 tonnes in 2001, and coltan was the country's biggest single export
earner in 2001. At least part of the increase in production is because of new
mines opening up in Rwanda. However it is true, as has frequently been
observed, that the increase is also because of the fraudulent re-export of
Congolese coltan. In addition to the well-publicised involvement in this trade
of the Rwandan Defence Force (RDF), another important factor in the coltan re-
export is that international dealers are under pressure not to buy from the
DRC, thus increasing the incentive for DRC coltan to be re-exported as
Rwanda's. Rwanda is also alleged to be trading in fraudulently exported gold
and diamonds from the DRC.

### 2006–present

The country entered a high period of economic growth in 2006, and the
following year managed to register 8% economic growth, a record it has
sustained since, turning it into one of the fastest-growing economies in
Africa. This sustained economic growth has succeeded in reducing poverty and
also reducing fertility rates, with growth between 2006 and 2011 reducing the
percentage of the country's population living in poverty from 57% to 45%.The
country's infrastructure has also grown rapidly, with connections to
electricity going from 91,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2011. Rwanda wants to
achieve Middle Income Country status by 2035 and High-Income Country status by
2050.

Existing foreign investment is concentrated in commercial establishments,
mining, tea, coffee, and tourism. Minimum wage and social security regulations
are in force, and the four prewar independent trade unions are back in
operation. The largest union, CESTRAR, was created as an organ of the
government but became fully independent with the political reforms introduced
by the 1991 constitution.

In 2016, Rwanda was ranked 42nd and second best country in Africa to do
business in the Mara Foundation-The Ashish J Thakkar Global Entrepreneurship
Index report.

However, a recent research in the UK-based political science journal, _Review
of African Political Economy_ , indicates that economic growth may be slower
than what official figures suggest. Researchers stated that average
consumption per household closely followed growth in GDP per capita from 2000
to 2005, but diverged afterwards when average consumption per household
stagnated despite huge improvements in GDP per capita from 2005 to 2013.

## Agriculture and primary resources

Coffee beans drying in Maraba. Coffee is one of Rwanda's major cash crops.
Rwanda has the tenth highest proportion of women working in agriculture,
forestry and fishing in the world.

Crops grown in the country include coffee, tea, pyrethrum, bananas, beans,
sorghum and potatoes. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with
the high altitudes, steep slopes and volcanic soils providing favourable
conditions. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts
in their prices. In 2019 agriculture accounted for 29% of the economy of
Rwanda. Rwanda produced in 2019: Bananas, pineapples, tea, coffee, and tobacco
are high-value, export-oriented products.

  * 2.6 million tonnes of banana;
  * 1.2 million tonnes of sweet potato;
  * 1.1 million tonnes of cassava;
  * 973 thousand tonnes of potato;
  * 484 thousand tonnes of beans;
  * 421 thousand tonnes of maize;
  * 256 thousand tonnes of pumpkin;
  * 171 thousand tonnes of taro;
  * 159 thousand tonnes of sorghum;
  * 131 thousand tonnes of rice;
  * 114 thousand tonnes of sugarcane;
  * 105 thousand tonnes of tomato;
  * 36 thousand tonnes of pineapple;
  * 31 thousand tonnes of tea;
  * 29 thousand tonnes of coffee;
  * 5.4 thousand tonnes of tobacco;

Rwanda's economy suffered heavily during the 1994 Genocide, with widespread
loss of life, failure to maintain the infrastructure, looting, and neglect of
important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the
country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has
since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,225 in 2018,
compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and
the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of
Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in June 2010, the exchange rate
was 588 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African
Community in 2007 and there were plans for a common East African shilling,
which it had been hoped would be in place by 2015, but have not yet reached
fruition (2020).

Rwanda is a country of few natural resources, and the economy is based mostly
on subsistence agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated
90% of the working population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated
42.0% of GDP in 2010. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have
been decreasing, due in part to the resettlement of displaced people. Despite
Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with
population growth, and food imports are required.

Agricultural animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs,
chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each.
Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive
dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-
quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary
services are major constraints that restrict output. A "One Cow per Poor
Family Programme" (Girinka), implemented in 2006, distributed 341,065 cows in
2018.

Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and
live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.

## Mining

Rwanda's mining industry is an important contributor, generating US$93 million
in 2008. Minerals mined include cassiterite, wolframite, sapphires, gold, and
coltan, which is used in the manufacture of electronic and communication
devices such as mobile phones. Production of methane from Lake Kivu began in
1983, but to date has been used only by the Bralirwa Brewery.

In 2019, the country was the 7th largest world producer of tungsten and the
12th largest world producer of tin.

## Energy and electrification

Rwanda has made tremendous strides in improving electrification in the 21st
century. A great number of new areas has become electrified through an
expansion of infrastructure.[_citation needed_]

Depletion of the forests will eventually pressure Rwandans to turn to fuel
sources other than charcoal for cooking and heating. Given the abundance of
mountain streams and lakes, the potential for hydroelectric power is
substantial. Rwanda is exploiting these natural resources through joint
hydroelectric projects with Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.[_citation needed_]

## Manufacturing

Rwanda's manufacturing sector is dominated by the production of import
substitutes for internal consumption. The larger enterprises produce beer,
soft drinks, cigarettes, hoes, wheelbarrows, soap, mattresses, plastic pipe,
roofing materials, and bottled water. Other products manufactured include
agricultural products, small-scale beverages, soap, furniture, shoes, cement,
plastic goods, textiles and cigarettes.

## Tourism and services

Rwanda's service sector suffered during the late-2000s recession as banks
reduced lending and foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The
sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic
output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors
include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and
restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate,
business services and public administration including education and health.

Tourism is one of the fastest-growing economic resources and became the
country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2011. In spite of the genocide's
legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe
destination; The Directorate of Immigration and Emigration recorded 405,801
people visiting the country between January and June 2011; 16% of these
arrived from outside Africa. Revenue from tourism was US$115,600,000 between
January and June 2011; holidaymakers contributed 43% of this revenue, despite
being only 9% of the numbers.

Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited
safely; gorilla tracking in the Volcanoes National Park attracts thousands of
visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other
attractions include: Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori colobus
and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna
reserve in the east of the country.

Rwanda's tourism is centred on the attractions of Volcanoes National Park
(PNV) with its six volcanoes and the protected population of mountain gorillas
made famous by Dian Fossey. Additionally, tourism is drawn to central Africa's
largest protected wetland Akagera National Park, with its populations of
hippopotami, cape buffalo, zebras, elephants, elands, and other big game
animals. Birdwatching-related tourism has a potential to develop as well,
especially in Nyungwe National Park, among the largest uncut forest reserves
in Africa. Nyungwe National Park is home to over 300 species of birds. And a
vast variety of wild life as well.

Several memorial sites associated with the Rwandan genocide have begun to
generate significant dark tourism. For example, the Gisozi Genocide Memorial
Site in the Gasabo District of Kigali—the burial place of approximately
300,000 victims of the genocide—has a related genocide exhibition area and
library and has plans to develop a teaching centre on the history of the
genocide. Another major genocide-related memorial centre attracting tourists
is the Murambi Genocide Memorial Site housed in the former Murambi Technical
School where 45,000 people were murdered and 850 skeletons and mummified
remains of the victims are on display.

Two other major memorial sites associated with the genocide are in Kicukiro
District: Rebero Genocide Memorial Site where 14,400 victims are buried and
the Nyanza-Kicukiro Genocide Memorial Site where 5,000 victims were killed
after Belgian soldiers who serving in the United Nations peacekeeping forces
abandoned them. In Kibungo Province, the site of the Nyarubuye Massacre is
home to the Nyarubuye Genocide Memorial Site where an estimated 20,000 victims
were killed after seeking refuge in the Roman Catholic church and homes of the
nuns and priest there.
