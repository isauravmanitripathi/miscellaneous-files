Set of productive activities developed in Guinea

The **economy of Guinea** is dependent largely on agriculture and other rural
activities. Guinea is richly endowed with minerals, possessing an estimated
quarter of the world's proven reserves of bauxite, more than 1.8 billion
tonnes (2.0 billion short tons) of high-grade iron ore, significant diamond
and gold deposits, and undetermined quantities of uranium. In 2021, Guinea was
the world's biggest exporter of Aluminium Ore ($3.2B/ Gold $5.5B) 2021 trade
surplus was $4.3B.

Guinea also has considerable potential for growth in the agricultural and
fishing sectors. Land, water, and climatic conditions provide opportunities
for large-scale irrigated farming and agroindustry. Remittances from Guineans
living and working abroad and coffee exports account for the rest of Guinea's
foreign exchanges industry.

## Economic history

GDP per capita development in Guinea

Guinea was part of the franc zone countries that included most of the former
French Colonies. After Independence, these countries did not become completely
economical free. France decided against monetary autonomy hence they could not
use a freely convertible currency. The state intervention of the new
governments was characterized by stops of quotas on imports and internal price
controls. In the time up to c. 1980, the franc-zone countries had on average a
lower inflation and a higher economic growth compared to the Anglophone
counterparts, who could use their own currencies. But regarding the time after
c. 1980 and the economic liberalism, characterized by Structural Adjustments,
the franc zone countries could not outperform the rest.

Since 1985, the Guinean Government has adopted policies to return commercial
activity to the private sector, promote investment, reduce the role of the
state in the economy, and improve the administrative and judicial framework.
The government has eliminated restrictions on agricultural enterprise and
foreign trade, liquidated many parastatals, increased spending on education,
and vastly downsized the civil service. The government also has made major
strides in restructuring the public finances.

The IMF and the World Bank are heavily involved in the development of Guinea's
economy, as are many bilateral donor nations, including the United States.
Guinea's economic reforms have had recent notable success, improving the rate
of economic growth to 5% and reducing the rate of inflation to about 99%, as
well as increasing government revenues while restraining official
expenditures. Although Guinea's external debt burden remains high, the country
is now current on external debt payments.

Current GDP per capita of Guinea shrank by 16% in the 1990s.

The government revised the private investment code in 1998 to stimulate
economic activity in the spirit of a free enterprise. The code does not
discriminate between foreigners and nationals and provides for repatriation of
profits. Foreign investments outside Conakry are entitled to especially
favorable conditions. A national investment commission has been formed to
review all investment proposals. The United States and Guinea have signed an
investment guarantee agreement that offers political risk insurance to
American investors through OPIC. Guinea plans to inaugurate an arbitration
court system to allow for the quick resolution of commercial disputes.

Mean wages were $0.45 per man-hour in 2009.

In 2002, the IMF suspended Guinea's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) because the government failed to meet key performance criteria. In
reviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending
goals in targeted social priority sectors. However, spending in other areas,
primarily defense, contributed to a significant fiscal deficit. The loss of
IMF funds forced the government to finance its debts through central bank
advances. The pursuit of unsound economic policies has resulted in imbalances
that are proving hard to correct.

Under then-Prime Minister Diallo, the government began a rigorous reform
agenda in December 2004 designed to return Guinea to a PRGF with the IMF.
Exchange rates have been allowed to float, price controls on gasoline have
been loosened, and government spending has been reduced while tax collection
has been improved. These reforms have not reduced inflation, which hit 27% in
2004 and 30% in 2005. Currency depreciation is also a concern. The Guinea
franc was trading at 2550 to the dollar in January 2005. It hit 5554 to the
dollar by October 2006. In August 2016 that number had reached 9089.

Despite the opening in 2005 of a new road connecting Guinea and Mali, most
major roadways remain in poor repair, slowing the delivery of goods to local
markets. Electricity and water shortages are frequent and sustained, and many
businesses are forced to use expensive power generators and fuel to stay open.

Even though there are many problems plaguing Guinea's economy, not all foreign
investors are reluctant to come to Guinea. Global Alumina's proposed alumina
refinery has a price tag above $2 billion. Alcoa and Alcan are proposing a
slightly smaller refinery worth about $1.5 billion. Taken together, they
represent the largest private investment in sub-Saharan Africa since the Chad-
Cameroon oil pipeline. Also, Hyperdynamics Corporation, an American oil
company, signed an agreement in 2006 to develop Guinea's offshore Senegal
Basin oil deposits in a concession of 80,000 square kilometres (31,000 sq mi);
it is pursuing seismic exploration.

On 13 October 2009, Guinean Mines Minister Mahmoud Thiam announced that the
China International Fund would invest more than $7bn (£4.5bn) in
infrastructure. In return, he said the firm would be a "strategic partner" in
all mining projects in the mineral-rich nation. He said the firm would help
build ports, railway lines, power plants, low-cost housing and even a new
administrative centre in the capital, Conakry. In September 2011, Mohamed
Lamine Fofana, the Mines Minister following the 2010 election, said that the
government had overturned the agreement by the ex-military junta.

Youth unemployment remains a large problem. Guinea needs an adequate policy to
address the concerns of urban youth. One problem is the disparity between
their life and what they see on television. For youth who cannot find jobs,
seeing the economic power and consumerism of richer countries only serves to
frustrate them further.

## Economic sectors

### Mining

In 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of bauxite.

Bauxite mining and alumina production provide about 80% of Guinea's foreign
exchange. Several U.S. companies are active in this sector. Diamonds and gold
also are mined and exported on a large scale, providing additional foreign
exchange. Concession agreements have been signed for future exploitation of
Guinea's extensive iron ore deposits.

Guinea is richly endowed with minerals, possessing an estimated one-third of
the world's proven reserves of bauxite, more than 1.8 billion metric tons (MT)
(2.0 billion short tons) of high-grade iron ore, significant diamond and gold
deposits, and undetermined quantities of uranium.

Lately, with the increase of alumina demand from the booming economy of China,
there is a renew interest in Guinea riches. The consortium Alcan and Alcoa,
partner with the Guinean government in the CBG mining in north western Guinea,
have announced the feasibility study for the construction of a 1 million TPa
alumina smelter. This comes with a similar project from Canadian start-up
Global Alumina trying to come with a 2 billion dollar alumina plant in the
same region. As of April 2005, the National Assembly of Guinea has not
ratified Global's project.

Revenue from bauxite mining is expected to fall significantly in 2010 due
mainly to the world economic situation.

### Mining controversies

Guinea has large reserves of the steel-making raw material, iron ore. Rio
Tinto was the majority owner of the $6 billion Simandou iron ore project,
which it had called the world's best unexploited resource. This project is
said to be of the same magnitude as the Pilbara in Western Australia.

In 2017, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group pled guilty to a multi-year bribery
scheme, after an investigation by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)
led to a trial in the United States and a fine of $412 million. Following
this, the SEC also filed a lawsuit in the US against head of Och-Ziff European
operations, Michael Cohen, for his role in a bribery scheme in the region.

In 2009 the government of Guinea gave the northern half of Simandou to BSGR
for an $165 million investment in the project and a pledge to spend $1 billion
on railways, saying that Rio Tinto wasn't moving into production fast enough.
The US Justice Department investigated allegations that BSGR had bribed
President Conté's wife to get him the concession, and so did the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the next elected President of Guinea, Alpha Condé,
and an assortment of other national and international entities.

In April 2014 the Guinean government cancelled the company's mining rights in
Simandou. BSGR has denied any wrongdoing, and in May 2014 sought arbitration
over the government of Guinea's decision to expropriate its mining rights. In
February 2019, BSGR and Guinean President Alpha Condé agreed to drop all
allegations of wrongdoing as well as the pending arbitration case. Under the
agreement, BSGR would relinquish rights to Simandou while being allowed to
maintain an interest in the smaller Zogota deposit that would be developed by
Niron Metals head Mick Davis.

In 2010 Rio Tinto signed a binding agreement with Aluminum Corporation of
China Limited to establish a joint venture for the Simandou iron ore project.
In November 2016, Rio Tinto admitted paying $10.5 million to a close adviser
of President Alpha Condé to obtain rights on Simandou. Conde said he knew
nothing about the bribe and denied any wrongdoing. However, according to
recordings obtained by France 24, Guinean authorities were aware of the
Simandou briberies.

In July 2017, the UK-based anti-fraud regulator, the Serious Fraud Office
(SFO) and the Australian Federal Police launched an investigation into Rio
Tinto's business practices in Guinea.

Further, In November 2016, the former mining minister of Guinea, Mahmoud
Thiam, accused head of Rio Tinto's Guinea operation department of offering him
a bribe in 2010 to regain Rio Tinto's control over half of the undeveloped
Simandou project.

In September 2011, Guinea adopted a new mining code. The law set up a
commission to review government deals struck during the chaotic days between
the end of dictatorship in 2008 and Condé coming to power.

In September 2015, the French Financial Public Prosecutor's Office launched an
investigation into President Alpha Conde's son, Mohamed Alpha Condé. He was
charged with embezzlement of public funds and receiving financial and other
benefits from French companies that were interested in the Guinean mining
industry.

In August 2016, son of a former Prime Minister of Gabon, who worked for Och-
Ziff's Africa Management Ltd, a subsidiary of the U.S. hedge fund Och-Ziff,
was arrested in the US and charged with bribing officials in Guinea, Chad and
Niger on behalf of the company to secure mining concessions and gain access to
relevant confidential information. The investigation also revealed that he was
involved in rewriting Guinea's mining law during President Conde's rule. In
December 2016, the US Department of Justice announced that the man pleaded
guilty to conspiring to make corrupt payments to government officials in
Africa.

According to a Global Witness report, Sable Mining sought iron ore
explorations rights to Mount Nimba in Guinea by getting close to Conde towards
the 2010 elections, backing his campaign for presidency and bribing his son.
These allegations have not been verified yet but in March 2016 Guinean
authorities ordered an investigation into the matter.

The Conde government investigated two other contracts as well, one which left
Hyperdynamic with a third of Guinea's offshore lease allocations as well as
Rusal's purchase of the Friguia Aluminum refinery, in which it said that Rusal
greatly underpaid.

### Agriculture

Guinea also has considerable potential for growth in the agricultural and
fishing sectors. Land, water, and climatic conditions provide opportunities
for large-scale irrigated farming and agroindustry. Possibilities for
investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas, but Guinea's
poorly developed infrastructure continues to present obstacles to investment
projects.

### Energy

Three primary energy sources make up the energy mix in Guinea – biomass, oil
and hydropower. With 78%, biomass (mostly charcoal) makes the largest
contribution in primary energy consumption in Guinea. It is locally produced,
while Guinea imports all petroleum products.

### Communications

The people of Guinea are among the poorest in West Africa and this reality is
reflected in the development of the country's telecommunications environment.
Radio is the most important source of information for the public in Guinea,
and the only one to reach the entire country.

There is a single government-owned radio network, a growing number of private
radio stations, and one government TV station. The fixed telephone system is
inadequate, with just 18,000 lines to serve the country's 10.5 million
inhabitants in 2012. The mobile cellular system is growing rapidly and had an
estimated 4.8 million lines in 2012. Internet usage is very low, reaching just
1.5% of the population in 2012.
