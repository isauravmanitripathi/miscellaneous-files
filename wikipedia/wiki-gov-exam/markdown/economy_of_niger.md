The **gross domestic product (GDP) of Niger** was $16.617 billion US dollars
in 2023, according to official data from the World Bank. This data is based
largely on internal markets, subsistence agriculture, and the export of raw
commodities: foodstuffs to neighbors and raw minerals to world markets. Niger,
a landlocked West African nation that straddles the Sahel, has consistently
been ranked on the bottom of the Human Development Index, at 0.394 as of 2019.
It has a very low per capita income, and ranks among the least developed and
most heavily indebted countries in the world, despite having large raw
commodities and a relatively stable government and society not currently
affected by civil war or terrorism. Economic activity centers on subsistence
agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of uranium.

The 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January 1994 boosted
exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's small
cotton industry. Exports of cattle to neighboring Nigeria, as well as
groundnuts and oil remain the primary non-mineral exports. The government
relies on bilateral and multilateral aid – which was suspended briefly
following coups in 1996 and 1999 – for operating expenses and public
investment. Short-term prospects depend on continued World Bank and IMF debt
relief and extended aid. The post-1999 government has broadly adhered to
privatization and market deregulation plans instituted by these funders. Niger
is a least developed country according to the United Nations.

## Overall

seasonal livestock forage is in brown.

Niger's economy is based largely on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of
the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 3.4%
population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut
an already marginal economy. Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small
trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal
sector jobs. Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger
was in the unregulated informal sector, including small and even large scale
rural and urban production, transport and services.

## GDP per capita

The GDP per capita of Niger grew 10% in the 1960s. However, this proved
unsustainable and it consequently shrank by 27% in the 1980s and a further 48%
in the 1990s. Much of this GDP is explained through the exploitation of
uranium at Arlit in the far north of the country. Ore is partially processed
on site by foreign mining corporations and transported by truck to Benin.
Fluctuation of GDP can be mapped to changes in international uranium prices,
as well as price negotiations with the main mining company, France's Orano
Cycle. Price rises in the mid-1970s were followed by a collapse in the market
price through much of the 1980s and 1990s. Thus the country's GDP per capita
has little direct impact on the average Nigerien, although uranium funds much
government operation. The 2006 Human Development Index ranked Niger sixth from
worst in the world, with a HDI of 0.370: 174 of 179 nations.

## External trade and investment

Niger's exports in 2006

Of Niger's exports, foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although
impossible to quantify, are second only to those from uranium. Actual exports
far exceed official statistics, which often fail to detect large herds of
animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides and skins are exported
and some are transformed into handicrafts.

### Mining

The persistent uranium price slump has brought lower revenues for Niger's
uranium sector. Uranium no longer provides the majority of national export
proceeds. The nation enjoyed substantial export earnings and rapid economic
growth during the 1960s and 1970s after the opening of two large uranium mines
near the northern town of Arlit. When the uranium-led boom ended in the early
1980s, however, the economy stagnated and new investment since then has been
limited. Niger's two uranium mines (SOMAIR's open pit mine and COMINAK's
underground mine) are owned by a French-led consortium and operated by French
interests.

Exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in Niger in the region between
the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso. Substantial deposits of
phosphates, coal, iron, limestone, and gypsum have also been found. Numerous
foreign companies, including American firms, have taken out exploration
licenses for concessions in the gold seam in western Niger, which also
contains deposits of other minerals.

Several oil companies explored for petroleum since 1992 in the Djado plateau
in north-eastern Niger and the Agadem basin, north of Lake Chad but made no
discoveries worth developing at the time. In June 2007, however, China
National Petroleum Corporation (state-owned by the People's Republic of China)
signed a US$5 billion agreement to extract oil in the Agadem block, as well as
build a 20,000 barrels (3,200 m3) per day oil refinery and a 2,000 km oil
pipeline in the country; production is expected to start in 2009.

Niger's known coal reserves, with low energy and high ash content, cannot
compete against higher quality coal on the world market. However, the
parastatal SONICHAR (Société nigérienne de charbon) in Tchirozerine (north of
Agadez) extracts coal from an open pit and fuels an electricity generating
plant that supplies energy to the uranium mines.

## Economic growth

After the economic competitiveness created by the January 1994 CFA franc
devaluation contributed to an annual average economic growth of 3.5%
throughout the mid-1990s, the economy stagnated due to the sharp reduction in
foreign aid in 1999, which gradually resumed in 2000, and poor rains in 2000.
Reflecting the importance of the agricultural sector, the return of good rains
was the primary factor underlying a projected growth of 4.5% for 2001.

## Foreign investment

In recent years, the Government of Niger promulgated revisions to the
investment code (1997 and 2000), petroleum code (1992), and mining code
(1993), all with attractive terms for investors. The present government
actively seeks foreign private investment and considers it key to restoring
economic growth and development. With the assistance of the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), it has undertaken a concerted effort to
revitalize the sector.

## Currency

Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with six other members of the
West African Monetary Union. The Treasury of the Government of France
supplements the BCEAO's international reserves in order to maintain a fixed
rate of 100 CFA (Communauté Financière Africaine) to the French franc (to the
euro as of January 1, 2002).

## Government restructuring

In January 2000, Niger's newly elected government inherited serious financial
and economic problems including a virtually empty treasury, past-due salaries
(11 months of arrears) and scholarship payments, increased debt, reduced
revenue performance, and lower public investment. In December 2000, Niger
qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund
program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries and concluded an agreement with the
Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

In addition to changes in the budgetary process and public finances, the new
government has pursued economic restructuring towards the IMF promoted
privatization model. This has included the privatization of water distribution
and telecommunications and the removal of price protections for petroleum
products, allowing prices to be set by world market prices. Further
privatizations of public enterprises are in the works. In its effort to comply
with the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility plan, the government is
also taking action to reduce corruption and, as the result of a participatory
process encompassing civil society, has devised a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Plan that focuses on improving health, primary education, rural
infrastructure, and judicial restructuring.

### Foreign aid

---|---  
  
The most important donors in Niger are France, the European Union, the World
Bank, the IMF and other United Nations agencies (UNDP, UNICEF, FAO, WFP, NGOs,
and UNFPA). Other principal donors include the United States, Belgium,
Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. USAID does not have an office
in Niger, the United States contributes nearly $10 million each year to
Niger's development. The US is also a major partner in policy coordination in
such areas as food security and HIV/AIDS. The importance of external support
for Niger's development is demonstrated by the fact that some 45% of the
government's FY 2002 budget, including 80% of its capital budget, derives from
donor resources.

In 2005 the UN drew attention to the increased need for foreign aid given
severe problems with drought and locusts resulting in a famine endangering the
lives of around a million people.

## Macro-economic trend

Historical development of real GDP per capita in Niger, since 1950

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2020 (with IMF
staff estimates in 2021–2026). Inflation below 5% is in green. The annual
unemployment rate is extracted from the World Bank, although the International

## Economic sectors

Niamey, Niger's capital and economic hub.

The economy of Niger centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the
world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 2.9%
population growth rate, and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut
the economy.

Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the
Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the
West African Monetary Union. Niger is also a member of the Organization for
the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).

In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the
International Monetary Fund program for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
and concluded an agreement with the Fund for Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative
significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds
for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention,
rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction.

In December 2005, it was announced that Niger had received 100% multilateral
debt relief from the IMF, which translates into the forgiveness of
approximately US$86 million in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining
assistance under HIPC. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from
foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of
oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Uranium prices have recovered
somewhat in the last few years. A drought and locust infestation in 2005 led
to food shortages for as many as 2.5 million Nigeriens.

### Economic sectors

#### Agriculture

against Long Rains Dry Season (July – Feb), measuring normal years crop growth
in the major Rice producing areas of Niger.

The agricultural economy is based largely upon internal markets, subsistence
agriculture, and the export of raw commodities: foodstuffs and cattle to
neighbors. Foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although difficult to
quantify, are considered the second source of export revenue behind mining and
oil exports. Actual exports far exceed official statistics, which often fail
to detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides
and skins are exported, and some are transformed into handicrafts.

Niger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of
the population. 14% of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production
(camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus
53% of the population is actively involved in crop production. The 15% of
Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with
Nigeria.

Drought has turned farmland into useless soil. A farmer examines the soil in
drought-stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.

In these areas, Pearl millet, sorghum, and cassava are the principal rain-fed
subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption is grown in parts
of the Niger River valley in the west. While expensive, it has, since the
devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice,
encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial
export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat. Oasis
farming in small patches of the north of the country produces onions, dates,
and some market vegetables for export.

But for the most part, rural residents engaged in crop tending are clustered
in the south centre and south west of the nation, in those areas (the Sahel)
which can expect to receive between 300 and 600 mm (12 and 24 in) of rainfall
annually. A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding Gaya can
expect to receive 700 to 900 mm (28 to 35 in) or rainfall. Northern areas
which support crops, such as the southern portions of the Aïr Massif and the
Kaouar oasis, rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to
mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation,
while within the Sahara desert, see just enough seasonal rainfall to support
semi-nomadic animal husbandry. The populations of these areas, mostly Tuareg,
Wodaabe – Fula, and Toubou, travel south (a process called transhumance) to
pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief
rainy season.

Rainfall varies and when it is insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its
population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food
requirements. Rains, as in much of the Sahel, have been marked by annual
variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the most
severe drought on record beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one
break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to
pastoralist populations, remains in the 21st century, with those communities
which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more
than once during this period. Recent rains remain variable. For instance, the
rains in 2000 were not good, while those in 2001 were plentiful and well
distributed.

Soils that have become degraded, for example by intensive cereal production,
cover 50 per cent of Niger's land. Laterite soils have a high clay content,
which means they have higher Cation Exchange Capacity and water-holding
capacity than sandy soils. If laterite soils become degraded, a hard crust can
form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration and the emergence of
seedlings. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called
the Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands.

This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits
and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value
fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought
conditions. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite
soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes. Trials have
demonstrated that a 200 m2 (2,153 sq ft) plot can yield an income of around
US$100, which is what men traditionally earn from millet production per
hectare (10000m2). As women are often given degraded soils, using this
practice has helped to improve livelihoods for women in Niger.

The Kandadji Dam on the Niger River, whose construction started in August
2008, is expected to improve agricultural production in the Tillaberi
Department by providing water for the irrigation of 6,000 hectares initially
and of 45,000 hectares by 2034.

#### Drought and food crisis

As one of the Sahelian nations in West Africa, Niger has faced several
droughts which led to food shortages and, in some cases, famines since its
independence in 1963. This includes a series of droughts in the 1970s and
1980s and more recently in 2005–2006 and again in 2010. The existence of
widespread famine in 2005–2006 was debated by the government of Niger as well
some local NGOs.

#### Mining

The Niger mining industry is the main source of national exports, of which
uranium is the largest export. Niger has been a uranium exporter since the
1960s and has had substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during
the 1960s and 1970s. The persistent uranium price slump has brought lower
revenues for Niger's uranium sector, although it still provides 72% of
national export proceeds. When the uranium-led boom ended in the early 1980s
the economy stagnated, and new investment since then has been limited. Niger's
two uranium mines—SOMAIR's open pit mine and COMINAK's underground mine—are
owned by a French-led consortium and operated by French company Orano.

As of 2007[update], many licences have been sold to other companies from
countries such as India, China, Canada and Australia in order to exploit new
deposits. In 2013, the government of Niger sought to increase its uranium
revenue by subjecting the two mining companies to a 2006 Mining Law. The
government argued that the application of the new law will balance an
otherwise unfavorable partnership between the government and Areva. The
company resisted the application of the new law that it feared would
jeopardize the financial health of the companies, citing declining market
uranium prices and unfavorable market conditions. In 2014, following nearly a
year long negotiation with the government of Niger, Areva agreed to the
application of 2006 Mining Law of Niger, which would increase the government's
uranium revenues from 5 to 12%.[_needs update_]

In addition to uranium, exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in
Niger in the region between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso.
In 2004, the first Nigerien gold ingot was produced from the Samira Hill Gold
Mine, in Tera Department. The Samira Hill Gold Mine thus became the first
commercial gold production in the country. The reserves at the location were
estimated at 10,073,626 tons at an average grade of 2.21 grams (0.078 oz) per
ton from which 19,200 kilograms (42,300 lb) will be recovered over a six-year
mine life. Other gold deposits are believed to be in nearby areas known as the
"Samira Horizon", which is located between Gotheye and Ouallam.

SONICHAR (Société Nigerienne de Charbon) in Tchirozerine (north of Agadez)
extracts coal from an open pit and fuels an electricity generating plant that
supplies energy to the uranium mines. Based on 2012 reports by the government
of Niger, 246016 tons of coal were extracted by SONICHAR in 2011. There are
additional coal deposits to the south and west that are of a higher quality
and may be exploitable. Substantial deposits of phosphates, coal, iron,
limestone, and gypsum have also been found in Niger.

#### Oil

A test oil well in the Tenere Desert, January 2008

The history of oil prospecting and discovery goes back to the independence era
with the first discovery of the Tintouma oil field in Madama in 1975. The
Agadem basin in particular has attracted much attention since 1970 with Texaco
and then Esso prospecting in the basin until 1980. Exploration permits on the
same basin were held successively by Elf Aquitaine (1980–1985), Esso-Elf
(1985–1998), Esso (1998–2002), and Esso-Petronas (2002–2006). While the
reserves were estimated at 324 million barrels for oil and 10 billion m3 for
gas, Esso-Petronas relinquished the permit because it deemed the quantities
too small for production.

With the sudden increase in oil price by 2008, this assessment was no longer
true; consequently, the government transferred the Agadem block rights to
CNPC. Niger announced that in exchange for the US$5 billion investment, the
Chinese company would build wells, 11 of which would open by 2012, a
20,000-barrel-per-day (3,200 m3/d) SORAZ refinery near Zinder, and a pipeline
out of the nation. The government estimates the area has reserves of 324
million barrels (51,500,000 m3), and is seeking further oil in the Tenere
Desert and near Bilma. Niger began producing its first barrels of oil in 2011.
Government revenue from this is over $100 million per year, about 5% of
Niger's GDP, and slightly higher than from the uranium extraction industry.

### Growth rates

The economic competitiveness created by the January 1994 devaluation of the
Communauté Financière Africaine (CFA) franc contributed to an annual average
economic growth of 3.5% throughout the mid-1990s. But the economy stagnated
due to the sharp reduction in foreign aid in 1999 (which gradually resumed in
2000) and poor rains in 2000. Reflecting the importance of the agricultural
sector, the return of good rains was the primary factor underlying economic
growth of 5.1% in 2000, 3.1% in 2001, 6.0% in 2002, and 3.0% in 2003.

In recent years, the Government of Niger drafted revisions to the investment
code (1997 and 2000), petroleum code (1992), and mining code (1993), all with
attractive terms for investors. The present government actively seeks foreign
private investment and considers it key to restoring economic growth and
development. With the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), it has undertaken a concerted effort to revitalize the private sector.

### Economic reforms

In January 2000, Niger's newly elected government inherited serious financial
and economic problems including a virtually empty treasury, past-due salaries
(11 months of unpaid salaries) and scholarship payments, increased debt,
reduced revenue performance, and lower public investment. In December 2000,
Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund
program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries and concluded an agreement with the
Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

In addition to changes in the budgetary process and public finances, the new
government has pursued economic restructuring towards the IMF promoted
privatization model. This has included the privatization of water distribution
and telecommunications and the removal of price protections for petroleum
products, allowing prices to be set by world market prices. Further
privatizations of public enterprises are in the works.

In its effort to comply with the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
plan, the government is also taking action to reduce corruption and, as the
result of a participatory process encompassing civil society, has devised a
Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan that focuses on improving health, primary
education, rural infrastructure, and judicial restructuring.

A long planned privatization of the Nigerien power company, NIGELEC, failed in
2001 and again in 2003 due to a lack of buyers. SONITEL, the nation's
telephone operator which was separated from the post office and privatised in
2001, was renationalised in 2009. Critics have argued that the obligations to
creditor institutions and governments have locked Niger into a process of
trade liberalization that is harmful for small farmers and in particular,
rural women.

### Infrastructure

breadbasket of Niger, the 20th century saw three severe Sahel droughts which
brought dramatic food insecurity to even the most fertile regions of Niger.

#### Transportation infrastructure

International Airport at Niamey

Transport is crucial to the economy and culture of this vast landlocked
nation, with cities separated by huge uninhabited deserts, mountain ranges,
and other natural features. Niger's transport system was little developed
during the colonial period (1899–1960), relying upon animal transport, human
transport, and limited river transport in the far south west and south east.
No railways were constructed in the colonial period. Construction of a network
of paved roads linking major cities began after the independence reaching its
heights during the uranium boom in the 1970s and 1980s. Primary or paved road
systems are limited to bigger cities or connection between major cities. Road
connections or networks in rural areas are mostly unpaved, all-weather
laterite surfaces to grated dirt or sand plowed roads with various degrees of
maintenance. In 2012, there was 19,675 kilometres (12,225 mi) of road network
throughout Niger, of which 4,225 kilometres (2,625 mi) were paved.

The Niger River, which crosses the southwestern part of the country, is
unsuitable for river transport of any large scale, as it lacks depth for most
of the year, and is broken by rapids at many spots. Camel caravan transport
was historically important in the Sahara desert and Sahel regions which cover
most of the north.

Air transport is mainly concentrated in Niamey. Niger's only international
airport is Diori Hamani International Airport, is located in the capital,
Niamey. Other airports in Niger include the Mano Dayak International Airport
in Agadez city and Zinder Airport in Zinder city but as of January 2015, they
were not regularly serviced by any carriers.

In 2014, construction for the railway extension connecting Niamey (Niger) to
Cotonou via Parakou (Benin) began and was expected to be completed by 2016.
However, the project was still ongoing in 2018, and no recent reports have
been made as of 2022. It includes the construction of 574 kilometres (357 mi)
new railway from Niamey to connect to the existing line in Parakou (Benin).
Besides Niamey, the railway line will go through Dosso city and Gaya.

#### Energy infrastructure

##### Accessibility to energy

Niger has insufficient access to the energy it needs. The country's energy
consumption is considered one of the lowest in the world. Niger's existing
systems of energy consumption are also very underdeveloped to sustain energy
efficiency within the state. Electricity access between urban areas such as
Niamey enable 50 percent electricity service, and rural areas with 20 to 40
percent electricity service, with the lowest region at 10 percent. Other
demands for electricity are met by NIGELEC, providing diesel generators and
thermal coal plants to create fuel for rent.

##### Primary energy outlets

Niger has three major energy consumption outlets; oil products, biofuel and
waste, and electricity. As of 2016, Niger's energy consumption includes 486
ktoe via oil products, 2,217 ktoe via biofuel and waste, and 84 ktoe via
electricity. Niger's predominant sources of energy are wood and charcoal, also
known as biomass. Out of the 2,747 ktoe of energy supply in the country, 70%
is from biomass. Households use up to 90% biomass due to the unavailability of
alternative sources, and the increased rates of imported energy that some
cannot afford. The most used oil products are liquefied petroleum gas, motor
gasoline, gas and diesel, other kerosene, and fuel oil.

##### Sustainable and renewable energy

Niger also gets partial access to hydroelectric power from dams created
alongside the Niger River.[_unreliable source?_] Hydroelectric power
contributes about 280 megawatts (MW) to Niger's energy collectively from
several hydropower sources, including 130 MW from the Kandadji, 122.5 from
River Niger in Gambou, and 26 MW from Dyondyonga in Mekrou. Getting renewable
energy via hydropower has proven controversial, due to the importance of
rainfall in acquiring energy. Again, these hydroelectric power dams are
creating energy for Niger via Nigeria.

Solar energy has also been used to provide energy access. From 2004 to 2010
solar power generation was implemented, but there was a significant drop from
2010 to 2012. However, since 2016 approximately 5 Gwh of solar power have been
used.

Niger has the potential to provide sustainable and renewable energy access
within the country, which would help increase its energy intake and cope with
the growing demands of the population. Several projects have been discussed to
make use of clean energy sources such as solar power, hydropower, grid power,
and wind power.

Many NGOs are working on funding projects to provide sustainable and renewable
energy in parts of Africa. Affording the resources to create sustainable
energy is one of the biggest barrier Niger faces, but agencies such as
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and AbuDhabi Fund for
Development (ADFD) are funding low developing countries, including Niger, to
help develop local renewable projects. Theses agencies will support projects
including a hybrid micro-grid project employing solar PV and advanced lithium-
ion batteries, a hydropower project, integrated wind and solar, and a
combination project consisting of micro-grid and solar home kits. In addition,
Lighting Africa, an NGO primarily working in Niger, is assisting in
sustainable energy development through two World Bank-sponsored Energy Access
Projects: the Niger Solar Electricity Project (NESAP), and the Regional Off-
Grid Electrification Project (ROGEP). These projects will work with grid
systems in two piloting countries, and this includes Niger. They will aim to
increase electricity access in households, businesses, and communities through
modern off-grid electrification.
