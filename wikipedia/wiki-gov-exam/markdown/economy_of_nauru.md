Map of NauruTree map of Nauru

The **economy of Nauru** is tiny, based on a population in 2019 of only 11,550
people. The economy has historically been based on phosphate mining. With
primary phosphate reserves exhausted by the end of the 2010s, Nauru has sought
to diversify its sources of income. In 2020, Nauru's main sources of income
were the sale of fishing rights in Nauru's territorial waters, and revenue
from the Regional Processing Centre (an offshore Australian immigration
detention facility).

Nauru is dependent on foreign aid, chiefly from Australia, Taiwan and New
Zealand.

## Economic performance

In the years after independence in 1968, Nauru possessed the highest GDP per
capita in the world due to its rich phosphate deposits.[_citation needed_] In
anticipation of the exhaustion of phosphate deposits, a substantial amount of
the income from phosphates was invested in trust funds aiming to help cushion
the transition and provide for Nauru's economic future. However, because of
heavy spending, including poor foreign investment, the government is
now[_when?_] facing bankruptcy. To cut costs the government called for a
freeze on wages, a reduction in public service staffing, privatization of
numerous government agencies, and closure of some of Nauru's overseas
consulates.[_citation needed_] Economic uncertainty caused by financial
mismanagement and corruption, combined with shortages of basic goods, resulted
in domestic unrest.[_citation needed_] In 2004, Nauru was faced with chaos
amid political strife and the collapse of the island's telecommunications
system. Moreover, the deterioration of housing and hospitals has
continued.[_citation needed_]

Few comprehensive statistics on the Nauru economy exist, with estimates of
Nauru's GDP varying widely. According to the U.S. State Department, Nauru's
GDP volume was US$1 million in 2004.[_need quotation to verify_] Nauru
receives about US$20 million foreign aid a year from Australia.

The nation's economy has grown significantly since 2012, with help from the
reopening of the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, funded by Australia.

The most recent 2022-23 Nauru Budget recognized expected revenues of $252.5
million and expenditure of $251.9 million (20% increase from Budget 2021–2022)
with a $549,000 surplus balance. The surplus will provide cash reserves at the
bank and help Nauru manage future economic uncertainties.

## Balance of payments

Phosphate is Nauru's only export product, although the government also
receives relatively significant foreign exchange income from licensing its
rich skipjack tuna fishing grounds to foreign fishing vessels, which land an
annual average of 50,000 tonnes of Nauru zone-caught tuna overseas. In 2004
income from phosphate export was US$640,000, with Australia, New Zealand and
Japan serving as the country's major export markets. In the same year the
Nauru government budget shows that income from licensing foreign fishing
vessels was over US$3,000,000.[_citation needed_]

Nauru needs to import almost all basic and capital goods, including food,
water, fuel, and manufactured goods, with Australia and New Zealand as its
major import sources. In 2004 Nauru's imports totaled about US$19.8 million.

## Finance

Nauru has been a cash economy since at least 2004, after the Bank of Nauru and
the Republic of Nauru Finance Corporation went bankrupt and ceased operations
in the early 2000s and the licenses of all offshore banks were revoked by the
Nauru government in 2004. Nauru uses the Australian dollar for its currency.
Most government payments are executed through electronic funds transfer.
Electronic funds transfer at point of sale was introduced in 2020. The
government is required to periodically fly in Australian currency to maintain
liquidity.

On 2 June 2015, an agency of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Australia's fifth
largest bank, was established in Nauru by the Department of Finance. Effective
from the end of April 2016, Westpac, one of Australia's largest banks, ceased
to have any dealings with the Nauru government. On 21 April 2016, it was
announced that the Bendigo Bank was facing pressure also to close its
operation in Nauru.

On 14 November 2023, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank announced its intention to
cease operation in Nauru by December 2024. On 24 January 2024, Nauru formally
re-established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China after
withdrawing recognition of Taiwan. In early March 2024, the Bank of China sent
a delegation to Nauru to discuss its banking problems. On 18 March, Bendigo
and Adelaide Bank announced its intention to delay its exit from Nauru, from
December 2024 to July 2025.

## Taxation

On October 1, 2014, an income tax was imposed in Nauru for the first time,
with high income earners paying a flat rate of 10%. The government spending in
2015 was forecast to be under US$92 million. Taxes include an airport
departure tax and a bed tax at the Meneñ Hotel. The 2007–08 Budget saw the
increase of existing excises on cigarettes and duty on imports. A tax on
sugary foods was also introduced, chiefly to help combat Nauru's diabetes
epidemic.

## Tax haven status

Historically Nauru was regarded as a tax haven due to the operation of its
international financial centre, which offered amongst other things offshore
banking services. In 2001, Nauru was blacklisted internationally over concerns
it had become a haven for money laundering. Amendments made in 2004 abolished
Nauru's Offshore Banking sector and, as recognised in Nauru's latest anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) review,
Nauru's offshore sector is now limited to a small offshore company register.

In July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Nauru had been
listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they
could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations.
The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and
the country was given a "largely compliant" rating.

## Relationship with Australia

Currently,[_when?_] Nauru is heavily dependent on Australia as its major
source of financial support. In 2001, Nauru signed an agreement with Australia
to accommodate asylum seekers (mostly from Iraq and Afghanistan) on the
island, in return for millions of dollars in aid. This agreement, referred to
as the "Pacific Solution", came to an end in 2007, prompting Nauruan concerns
about the future of the island's revenue. Australia has also sent financial
experts to Nauru to help the tiny nation overcome its economic problems.
However, serious questions remain about the long-term viability of Nauru's
economy, with uncertainties about the rehabilitation of mined land and the
replacement of income from phosphates.

In 2008, talks began between Australia and Nauru regarding the future of the
former's economic development aid to the latter. Nauruan Foreign and Finance
Minister Dr. Kieren Keke stated that his country did not want aid handouts.
One possible solution currently[_when?_] being explored would be for Australia
to assist Nauru in setting up a "boat repair industry" for regional fishing
vessels.

### Nauru detention centre

The Nauru detention centre was established by the Australian government, with
Nauruan agreement, in 2001 to cater for up to 800 refugees and asylum seekers
under Australia's Pacific solution. The centre is seen by Nauruans as an
important source of employment opportunities, in addition to the pledge of
A$20 million for development activities.[_citation needed_] The program was
gradually scaled back after 14 detainee deaths, multiple suicide attempts and
six referrals to the International Criminal Court.
