The **economy ofSierra Leone** is $8.39 billion by gross domestic product as
of 2025. Since the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War in 2002, the economy is
gradually recovering with a gross domestic product growth rate between 4 and
7%. In 2024, the IMF ranked it the 149th largest economy in the world by PPP.

Sierra Leone's economic development has always been hampered by an
overdependence on mineral exploitation. Successive governments and the
population as a whole have always believed that "diamonds and gold" are
sufficient generators of foreign currency earnings and lure for investment.

As a result, large scale agriculture of commodity products, industrial
development and sustainable investments have been neglected by governments.
The economy could thus be described as one which is "exploitative" - a rentier
state \- and based upon the extraction of unsustainable resources or non-
reusable assets.

Two-thirds of the population of Sierra Leone are directly involved in
subsistence agriculture. Agriculture accounted for 58 percent national GDP in
2007.

## Economic history

This is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Sierra Leone at market
prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund and EconStats with figures
in millions of Sierra Leones.

Year | Gross Domestic Product   
---|---  
1965 | 246   
1970 | 355   
1975 | 572   
1980 | 1,155   
1985 | 4,365   
1990 | 98,386   
1995 | 657,604   
2000 | 1,330,429   
  
Current GDP per capita of Sierra Leone grew 32% in the 1960s, reaching a peak
growth of 107% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and it consequently
shrank by 52% in the 1980s and a further 10% in the 1990s.

The mean wage was US$0.32 per hour in 2009.

### Agriculture

Two-thirds of the population of Sierra Leone are directly involved in
subsistence agriculture. Agriculture accounted for 58 percent national Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007.

Agriculture is the largest employer with 80 percent of the population working
in the sector. Rice is the most important staple crop in Sierra Leone with 85
percent of farmers cultivating rice during the rainy season and an annual
consumption of 76 kg per person.

### Energy

Sierra Leone electricity production by source

As of 2016, about 12% of the population of Sierra Leone had access to
electricity. Of that 12%, 10% was in Freetown, and the remaining 90% of the
country used 2% of the nation's electricity. The majority of the population
relies on biomass fuels, with firewood and coal used most prevalently. The
burning of these sources has been reported to have adverse health effects on
women and children. The use of coal and firewood has also posed environmental
concerns as they are both in conflict with the push for more sustainable
sources of energy. As a result, the commercialisation of firewood and coal has
been a point of contention with aid donors and government agencies. There have
been strong pushes for both solar and hydropower to become the dominant
sources of energy. Sierra Leone's tropical climate, heavy annual rainfall, and
abundance of rivers give it the potential to pursue more solar and hydropower
alternatives.

In conjunction with the UK's Department for International Development (DFID),
Sierra Leone has set a goal to provide solar power to all its citizens by
2025. It aims provide solar power to at least 50,000 homes in 2016, 250,000
homes by 2017, and 1,000,000 people by 2020. This initiative falls under the
Energy Africa access campaign. Before this compact agreement, Sierra Leone's
private sector for solar energy was weak, as it provided energy to less than
5% of the target population. Part of the reason for this was the import
duties, taxes, and lack of quality control. To ensure that the Energy Africa
goal is met, Sierra Leone has agreed to remove its import duties and Value
Added Tax (VAT) on certified solar products. It is estimated that there will
be a 30% to 40% cost reduction on solar products with the lack of duties and
taxes.

As of 2012, Sierra Leone has three main hydroelectric plants: the Guma plant,
which was decommissioned in 1982; the Dodo Plant, in the Eastern Province; and
the Bumbuna plant. There is also potential for several new hydroelectric
plants to open on the Sewa River, Pampana River, Seli River, Moa River, and
Little Scarcies. The Bumbuna dam is the largest and was estimated to produce
about 50 megawatts of electricity. It has been projected that the Bumbuna dam
could reduce the amount of spending on foreign fuel and save the country at
least $2 million a month.

### Mining

Rich in minerals, Sierra Leone has relied on the mining sector in general, and
diamonds in particular, for its economic base. In the 1970s and early 1980s,
economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector.
Financially disadvantageous exchange rates and government budget deficits led
to sizable balance-of-payments deficits and inflation.

Certain policy responses to external factors as well as implementations of aid
projects and maintenance have led to a general decline in economic activity
and a serious degradation of economic infrastructures. Sierra Leone's short-
term prospects depend upon continued adherence to International Monetary Fund
programs and continued external assistance.

### Telecommunications

Radio is the most-popular and most-trusted media source in Sierra Leone, with
72% of people in the country listening to the radio daily. Sierra Leone is
home to one government-owned national radio station and roughly two dozen
private radio stations, as well as one government-owned and one private TV
station.

Telephone and telegraph services are marginal, but improving. Internet usage
is low, reaching just 1.3% of the population in 2012, but improving with
growth in 3G mobile cellular data services and the mid-2011 arrival of the ACE
international fiber-optic cable system in Freetown.

### Tourism

According to the International Labour Organization, approximately 8,000 Sierra
Leoneans are employed in the tourism industry, with a growing number of jobs
expected to be created in the future. The main entrance point is Freetown
International Airport, where transport to and from has been problematic. The
main attractions for tourist in Sierra Leone are the beaches, nature reserves
and mountains.

### Transport

Because of widespread poverty, high petroleum prices and a large portion of
the population residing in small communities, walking is often the preferred
method of transportation in Sierra Leone. There are 11,700 kilometres (7,270
mi) of highway in Sierra Leone, of which 936 km (582 mi) are paved.

There are 800 km (497 mi) of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which 600 km (373
mi) are navigable year-round. Major ports of Sierra Leone include: Bonthe,
Freetown and Pepel. Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown represents the
country's only deep water port facility capable of berthing large-hulled cargo
or military vessels.

There are ten airports in Sierra Leone, of which one - Lungi International
Airport in Freetown - has a paved runway in excess of 3000m in length. Of the
remaining airports, all of which have unpaved runways, seven have runways of
lengths between 914 and 1,523 m (2,999 and 4,997 ft); the remaining two having
runways of shorter length. There are two heliports in the country.[_where?_]

## Trade and investment

Sierra Leonean exports in 2006.

Mineral exports remain Sierra Leone's principal foreign exchange earner.
Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in this
resource, the country has historically struggled to manage its exploitation
and export. Annual production estimates range between $70–$250 million;
however, only a fraction of that passes through formal export channels (1999:
$1.2 million; 2000: $16 million; 2001: projections $25 million). The balance
is smuggled out and has been used to finance rebel activities in the region,
money laundering, arms purchases, and financing of other illicit activities,
leading some to characterize Sierra Leone's diamonds as a "conflict resource."

Recent efforts on the part of the country to improve the management of the
export trade have met with some success. In October 2000, a new UN-approved
export certification system for exporting diamonds from Sierra Leone was put
into place that led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the
Government of Sierra Leone created a mining community development fund, which
returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The
fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.

Sierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of rutile, a titanium ore
used as paint pigment and welding rod coatings. Sierra Rutile Limited, fully
owned by Nord Resources of the United States, began commercial mining
operations near Bonthe in early 1979. Sierra Rutile was then the largest non-
petroleum U.S. investment in West Africa. The export of 88,000 tons realized
$75 million for the country in 1990.

The company and the Government of Sierra Leone concluded a new agreement on
the terms of the company's concession in Sierra Leone in 1990. Rutile and
bauxite mining operations were suspended when rebels invaded the mining sites
in 1995. Negotiations for reactivation of rutile and bauxite mining are in
progress. The U.S. interest in the company has been reduced to 25%.

Since independence, the Government of Sierra Leone has encouraged foreign
investment, although the business climate suffers from uncertainty and a
shortage of foreign exchange because of civil conflicts. Investors are
protected by an agreement that allows for arbitration under the 1965 World
Bank Convention. Legislation provides for transfer of interest, dividends, and
capital.

### Central Asia

On 8 April 2025, Sierra Leone’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Timothy Musa
Kabba, paid his first official visit to Kazakhstan, where he met with Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Murat Nurtleu. The two countries agreed to
enhance cooperation in trade, transport and logistics, healthcare,
agriculture, and IT. Kazakhstan, a major global grain producer, proposed using
the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route to supply African markets with
food products. Additionally, the Kazakhstan Agency for International
Development shared elements of its e-Government platform with Sierra Leone,
building on a prior memorandum of understanding. A Roadmap for Cooperation
between the foreign ministries was signed, and Sierra Leone also supported
Kazakhstan’s initiative to establish a UN Regional Center for Sustainable
Development Goals in Almaty.

## Currency and central bank

The currency is the NLE. The central bank of the country is the Bank of Sierra
Leone which is in the capital, Freetown. The country operates a floating
exchange rate system, and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the
commercial banks, recognized foreign exchange bureaux and most hotels. Credit
card use is limited in Sierra Leone, though they may be used at some hotels
and restaurants. There are a few internationally linked automated teller
machines that accept Visa cards in Freetown operated by ProCredit Bank.

## Membership of international economic bodies

Sierra Leone is a member of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS). With Liberia and Guinea, it formed the Mano River Union (MRU)
customs union, primarily designed to implement development projects and
promote regional economic integration.

The MRU has so far been inactive because of domestic problems and internal and
cross-border conflicts in all three countries. The future of the MRU depends
on the ability of its members to deal with the fallout from these internal and
regional problems.[_citation needed_]

Sierra Leone is a member of the WTO.
