Dutch exports in 2006 The labour productivity level of the Netherlands is one
of highest in Europe. OECD, 2012 Part-time employment rate (%) in OECD
countries. The Netherlands has the highest rate.

The **economy of the Netherlands** is a highly developed market economy
focused on trade and logistics, manufacturing, services, innovation and
technology and sustainable and renewable energy. It is the world's 18th
largest economy by nominal GDP and the 28th largest by purchasing power parity
(PPP) and is the fifth largest economy in European Union by nominal GDP. It
has the world's 11th highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the 13th highest per
capita GDP (PPP) as of 2023 making it one of the highest earning nations in
the world. Many of the world's largest tech companies are based in its capital
Amsterdam or have established their European headquarters in the city, such as
IBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Cisco, Uber and Netflix. Its second largest
city Rotterdam is a major trade, logistics and economic center of the world
and is Europe's largest seaport. Netherlands is ranked fifth on global
innovation index and fourth on the Global Competitiveness Report. Among OECD
nations, Netherlands has a highly efficient and strong social security system;
social expenditure stood at roughly 25.3% of GDP.

The Netherlands has a prosperous and open economy, which depends heavily on
foreign trade. The economy is noted for stable industrial relations, fairly
low unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account surplus (which,
compared to the size of the country, is even more than Germany) and an
important role as a European transportation hub; Rotterdam is the biggest port
in Europe; and Amsterdam has one of the biggest airports in the world.
Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum
refining, high-tech, financial services, the creative sector and electrical
machinery. Its highly mechanized agricultural sector employs no more than 2%
of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing
industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners,
began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002.

The Netherlands has had steady natural gas resources since 1959, when a
wellspring was discovered. Currently the Netherlands accounts for more than
25% of all natural gas reserves in the European Union. Over the following
decades, the sale of natural gas generated a significant rise in revenue for
the Netherlands. However, the unforeseen consequences of the country's energy
wealth originally impacted the competitiveness of other sectors of the
economy, leading to the theory of Dutch disease, after the discovery of the
vast Groningen gas field.

The Netherlands is a "conduit country" that helps to funnel profits from high-
tax countries to tax havens. It has been ranked as the 7th largest tax haven
in the World.

The stern financial was abandoned in 2009, because of the then-current credit
crises. The relatively large banking sector was partly nationalized and bailed
out through government interventions. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.0% in
the summer of 2011, but increased with a sharp rate to 7.3% in May 2013, and
6.8% in 2015. It dropped again to 3.9% in March 2018. The state budget deficit
was about 2.2% in 2015, well below the norm of 3.0% in the EU. In 2016, the
state budget showed a surplus of 0.4%. It was expected to grow to a surplus of
over 1.0% in 2017. Historically, the Dutch introduced and invented the stock
market, which initially focused on merchandise trading through the Dutch East
India Company. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union, the
OECD and the World Trade Organization.

## History

After declaring its independence from the empire of Philip II of Spain in
1581, the Netherlands experienced almost a century of explosive economic
growth. A technological revolution in capital, due to Protestant traders of
Flanders who fled to the Netherlands, helped the young Republic become the
dominant trade power by the mid-17th century. In 1670 the Dutch merchant
marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping—about half the European total. The
main reasons for this were the dominance of the Amsterdam Entrepôt in European
trade, and that of the Dutch East India Company (or Verenigde Oost-Indische
Companie – VOC) and West India Companies in intercontinental trade. These
companies were based on the English model and the success of England's joint-
stock enterprises and trading guilds.

Beside trade, an early "industrial revolution" (powered by wind, water and
peat), land reclamation from the sea, and agricultural revolution, helped the
Dutch economy achieve the highest standard of living in Europe (and presumably
the world) by the middle of the 17th century. Affluence facilitated what is
known as the Dutch Golden Age. This economic boom abruptly came to an end by a
combination of political-military upheavals and adverse economic developments
around 1670. Still the Netherlands kept a high level of prosperity, due to
trade and agriculture.

Towards the 1800s, the Netherlands did not industrialize as rapidly as some
other countries in Europe. One explanation for this is that the Netherlands
were struggling to come to terms with having lost their dominant economical
(based mainly on trade and agriculture) and political position in the world.
Griffiths argues that government policies made possible a unified Dutch
national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal
tariffs and guilds; a unified coinage system; modern methods of tax
collection; standardized weights and measures; and the building of many roads,
canals, and railroads.

The rest of Europe in the 19th century saw the gradual transformation of the
Netherlands into a modern middle-class industrial society. The number of
people employed in agriculture decreased while the country made an effort to
revive its stake in the highly competitive industrial and trade business. The
Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in
industrialization, then caught up by about 1920. Major industries included
textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam
became a major shipping and manufacturing center. Poverty slowly declined and
begging largely disappeared along with steadily improving working conditions
for the population.

In 1959, the Netherlands discovered large natural gas fields. The export of
natural gas led to large windfall profits. However, as an unforeseen
consequence, these were believed to have led to a decline in the manufacturing
sector in the Netherlands.

## Government

While the private sector is the cornerstone of the Dutch economy, governments
at different levels have a large part to play. Public spending, excluding
social security transfer payments, was at 28% of GDP in 2011. Total tax
revenue was 38.7% of GDP in 2010, which was below the EU average. In addition
to its own spending, the government plays a significant role through the
permit requirements and regulations pertaining to almost every aspect of
economic activity. The government combines a rigorous and stable microeconomic
policy with wide-ranging structural and regulatory reforms. The government has
gradually reduced its role in the economy since the 1980s. Privatization and
deregulation is still continuing. With regards to social and economic policy,
the government cooperates with its so called social partners (trade unions and
employers' organizations). The three parties come together in the Social-
Economic Council (‘Sociaal Economische Raad’), the main platform for social
dialogue.

### Social security system

The Dutch social security is very comprehensive and multi-
faceted,[_clarification needed_] and is divided into the national security
(_Volksverzekering)_ and the employee insurance (_Werknemersverzekering)._
Whereas the first covers all living in the Netherlands and the social benefits
provided, the latter provides employment-related benefits. All living in the
Netherlands are required to pay into the social security system, including
residents from outside the Netherlands, with a few exceptions.

The Volksverzekering is compulsory for all and covers the residents under
different forms of national insurance:

  * Long-term care under the Long-Term Care Act (_Wet Langdurige Zorg (WLZ)) (_ formerly known as The Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (Algemen Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ)))
  * Pension care under the General Old Age Pensions Act (_Algemene Ouderdomswet (AOW))_
  * Survivor benefits under the General Surviving Relatives Act (_Algemene nabestaandenwet( ANW)) (formerly known as _The General Widow's and Orphans’ Act (Algemene Weduwen-en Wezenwet (AWW)))
  * Child benefits under the General Family Allowances Act (_Algemene Kinderbijslagwet (AKW))_

It is overseen by the Social Insurance Bank (_Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB))_
and financed through earning-related contributions of employers and employees
up until a maximum income-ceiling. Whilst employed persons get their
contribution deducted automatically from their wage, the unemployed pay by
themselves. The AKW is financed by employers, whereas the AOW is financed by
the employees. The AOW, additionally, is financed by a small government
subsidy.

The _Werknemersverzekering_ is compulsory for all employed people within the
Netherlands. It includes the coverage of employees in the following areas:

  * Unemployment benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Act (_Werkloosheidswet (WW))_
  * Sick leave under the Sickness Benefits Act (_Ziektewet (ZW))_
  * Disability benefits under the Disablement Insurance Act (_Wet werk en inkomen naar arbeidsvermogen_ _(WIA))_

The financing for the _Werknemersverzekering_ is automatically deducted from
the employee's income by the employer.

#### Unemployment benefits

##### Coverage

The unemployment benefits in the Netherlands, as set out under the WW, covers
almost all employees, that are employees based on a working-contract. Excluded
from the WW are the following: self-employed, nationally employed, persons
working less than four days a week, heads of stockholders and voluntary
workers that earn up to €150 per year.

##### Right to benefits

To profit from the benefit the unemployed has to submit an application to the
Employee Insurance Agency (_Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen
(UWV))_ within one week of becoming unemployed and additionally has to
register as job-seeker. The WW only covers employees with a sufficient work
history, meaning that an applicant has to have been working for at least 26
weeks in the past 36 weeks before becoming unemployed. If so, the working-
weeks requirement is met. Moreover, the employee is only eligible to
unemployment benefits if the unemployment has not been due to his own fault
(e.g. own termination of the job contract).

##### Benefits

The benefits received through the WW are earnings-related and amount to 75% of
the previous daily earnings (based on 5 working days per week) for the
duration of two months. After those two months the benefits reduce to 70%.
Part-time work is taken into account with a calculation of parts of the
working hours.[_clarification needed_] If this benefit is less than the
minimum income, the benefit can be supplemented under the Additional
Allowances Act (_Toeslagenwet_). If there has been a change of employment, all
jobs in the previous twelve months are included in the calculation of the
benefits. To continue to receive benefits, the individual needs to be actively
looking for work. Moreover, one needs to participate in e-coaching three and
twelve months after the start of unemployment. After one year of unemployment
one must register with an employment agency.

### Controversial issues

#### Labour market and social welfare

The Dutch labour market has relatively strict regulations for employers on
firing employees, although by June 2014 the House of Representatives has
agreed to loosen these regulations.[_needs update_] Due to the costs of
employees and costs of firing them, a large part of the working force (about
15% of the working force) is an independent one person company (ZZP). They are
independent and get paid by delivery without higher social
costs.[_clarification needed_] Another big part of the workforce is hired as
temporary workforce. State unemployment benefits in the form of a 70% benefit
of the employee's last-earned salary for up to three years (with a maximum of
roughly 2500 euros per month) are available for fired employees, provided that
they have worked for a certain minimum time period, usually 26 weeks.
Moreover, the self-employed individuals (zelfstandigen zonder personeel (ZZP))
are not automatically covered under the _Werknemersverzekeringen_ , and are
not obligated to enroll into unemployment, sickness or disabilities insurance.
Self-employed individuals are therefore required to enroll themselves with
private insurance companies. The Dutch Government is however, working hard to
combat bogus self-employment by applying significant changes and tightening of
rules under Wet Deregulering Beoordeling Arbeidsrelaties (DBA). .

#### Age of retirement

Under the AOW (General Old Age Pensions Act) of 1956, every Dutch citizen was
entitled to a state pension from the age of 65. However the act was amended in
2012 to increase the pension age in several stages up to 67 in 2024. Married
couples and those who live together receive 50% of minimum wage per person,
and a single person receives 70% of minimum wage. Most (about 70%) earn an
extra pension from private pension funds. Employees are obliged to participate
in the sector pension funds.[_clarification needed_] The total amount of
pension funds at the end of 2009 was some 664 billion euro and by the end of
2019 this had increased to 1560 billion euro, for a population of just over 17
million. Employees receive on average about 70% of their final salary. During
the economic crisis[_which?_] and because of low interest rates, pension funds
have had difficulty keeping up with inflation.

#### Inequality and redistribution

With a Gini coefficient of 25.1 (2013) the income inequality is relatively low
in the Netherlands. However, the inequality when measured in distributions of
household wealth is high, where the top 1% owns 24% of all net wealth, and the
top 10% own 60%. Moreover, rather large wealth disparities persist in the
Netherlands in relation to age, where those under 35 years-of-age own 10% as
much as older workers. This is a consequence from the low taxation of home
ownership and a generous mortgage interest deductibility, which benefit the
wealthier households. Due to the generous pensions the pension-related savings
are the most important part of wealth in the Netherlands, yet are not subject
to capital income taxation, which increases the inequality. The taxation comes
as income tax when the saved pension is paid out. People having earned minimum
wages only, will not build up any pension. The idea behind a pension is to
have a net income after retirement that is comparable to before retirement.
The AOW, the Dutch retirement law, guarantees an income up to 70% of minimum
wage per person. Therefore, only people earning more than minimum wage need to
save to ensure comparable income after retirement.

#### Home mortgage interest deduction

The Netherlands was[_when?_] one of the few countries in the world where the
interest paid on mortgages is almost fully deductible from income tax. Since
2013 big changes were made. The conditions allowing a borrowing of more than
116% of the value of the home were reduced to 106% and are still continuously
being reduced every year. The deduction is also capped to 50.5% and reducing
every year. Together with the after-effects of the Great Recession the result
was a housing crisis, with a decrease of prices almost 25% percent in some
areas. Recent years have shown a recovery of 10% to even 20% per year in the
most popular cities.

The Service sector accounts for more than half of the national income,
primarily in transportation, distribution and logistics, financial areas,
software development and the creative industry. The breadth of service
providers in financial services has contributed to the Netherlands achieving a
DAW Index score of 5 in 2012. Industrial activity is dominated by the
machinery, electronics/high tech industry, metalworking, oil refining,
chemical, and food-processing industries. Construction amounts to about 6% of
GDP. Agriculture and fishing, although visible and traditional Dutch
activities, account for just 2%.

The Netherlands continues to be one of the leading European nations for
attracting foreign direct investment and is one of the five largest investors
in the United States. The economy experienced a slowdown in 2005, but in 2006
recovered to the fastest pace in six years on the back of increased exports
and strong investment. The pace of job growth reached 10-year highs in 2007.
The Netherlands is the fifth-most competitive economy in the world, according
to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report.

## Primary sector

### Agriculture

In 2018, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products,
the Netherlands produced:

  * 1.2 million tons of onion;
  * 14 million tons of cow milk;
  * 247 thousand tons of barley;
  * 269 thousand tons of apple;
  * 295 thousand tons of lettuce;
  * 300 thousand tons of mushroom and truffle;
  * 355 thousand tons of bell pepper;
  * 402 thousand tons of pear;
  * 410 thousand tons of cucumber;
  * 538 thousand tons of carrot;
  * 6.0 million tonnes of potatoes (10th largest producer in the world);
  * 6.5 million tons of sugar beet, which is used to produce sugar and ethanol;
  * 910 thousand tons of tomato;
  * 961 thousand tons of wheat.

## Energy sector

### Natural gas

Natural gas concessions in the Netherlands. Today the Netherlands accounts for
more than 25% of all Natural Gas reserves in the EU. Station Wildervank of the
Groningen natural gas field, which transformed the Netherlands economy after
its discovery in 1959, leading to the theory of Dutch disease

The discovery of the large Groningen natural gas field in 1959 and the massive
windfalls accrued over subsequent decades, were believed to have led to a
decline in the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands, leading to the theory
of Dutch disease.

While its oil reserves in the North Sea are of little importance, the
Netherlands have an estimated 25% of natural gas reserves in the EU. Natural
gas reserves of the Netherlands are estimated (as of 2014) to be about 600
billion cubic feet, or about 0.3% of the world total. In 2014–2015 the
government decided to reduce the production of gas in the province Groningen
significantly due to problems of sinking ground, differential settlement
levels and tremors (small earth quakes) causing damages to properties, end
2018 the government decided to completely abandon the gas production in the
province of Groningen by reducing the production slightly each year, the
production was expected to come to a halt entirely by 2028. On June 23, 2023,
the government decided to close the remaining five production facilities as of
October 1, 2023. The possibility of reopening one or more facilities is being
kept open, citing the uncertain international situation and possibly very cold
weather as possible reasons for this. All wells will be permanently closed and
dismantled as of October 1, 2024.

To reduce its greenhouse emissions, the government of the Netherlands is
subsidizing a transition away from natural gas for all homes in the country by
2050. In the Netherlands, 98% of enterprises are reducing greenhouse gas
emissions, beating the EU average of 89%. However, only 48% of Dutch firms set
and monitor their own emission targets. Dutch enterprises mostly cut emissions
through waste reduction or recycling (86%), as well as energy efficiency
programmes (76%).

In the Netherlands, 78% of enterprises have invested in reducing carbon
emissions and mitigating the impact of weather disasters as of 2023. Six out
of ten (60%) plan to invest in these areas during the next three years. The
numbers for 'already invested' and 'intend to invest' above the EU average
(56% and 54%, respectively). The largest invested is in trash reduction or
recycling (86% of Dutch firms).

Dutch companies are more likely to see the transition to stronger climate laws
as an opportunity (39% vs 23% from other European firms).

### Nuclear energy

Researchers in the Netherlands began studying nuclear energy in the 1930s and
began construction of research reactor Dodewaard in 1955. Researchers’ goal
was to introduce nuclear power technology by 1962 and replace fossil fuels. In
1968, a test nuclear reactor was attached to the power grid. This unit was
shut down in 1997. In the 1970s, the Dutch chose a policy that required
reprocessing all spent nuclear fuel. In 1984, the government decided to create
a long-term (100 years) storage facility for all intermediate and low-level
radioactive waste and research strategies for ultimate disposal. In September
2003, the Central Organization for Radioactive Waste created an interim
storage facility for high-level waste. The Netherlands' only commercial
nuclear reactor is Borssele, which became operational in 1973 and as of
2011[update] produces about 4% of the country's electricity. The older
Dodewaard nuclear power plant was a test reactor that later got attached to
the national grid but was closed in 1997. A 2MW research reactor known as
Reactor Institute Delft (RID) is located in Delft, as part of the physics
department of Delft University of Technology. This reactor is not meant for
energy provision but used as a neutron and positron source for research.

In 1994, the States General of the Netherlands voted to phase out nuclear
power after a discussion of nuclear waste management. In 1997, the power
station at Dodewaard was shut down and the government decided it was planning
to end Borssele's operating license in 2003. This has since been postponed to
2034, if it complied with the highest safety standards.[_citation needed_]
After the 2010 election, the new government was open to expanding nuclear
power. Both of the companies that share ownership of Borssele are proposing to
build new reactors. In January 2012, Delta announced it postpones any decision
to start building a second nuclear power plant.

## Tourism

In 2011, the Netherlands was visited by 11.3 million foreign tourists. In
2012, the Dutch tourism industry contributed 5.4% in total to the country's
GDP and 9.6% in total to its employment. With its global ranking of 147th and
83rd place for total contribution to respectively GDP and employment, tourism
is a relatively small sector of the Dutch economy. North Holland was by far
the most popular province for foreign tourists in 2011. Out of all 11.3
million tourists, 6 million visited North Holland. South Holland took the
second place with 1.4 million. Germans, Britons and Belgians made up the
majority of foreign tourists, respectively 3, 1.5 and 1.4 million. As of 2020,
there are nine World Heritage Sites in the Netherlands. The Netherlands are
well known for their art and rich historical heritage.

In the fast food restaurant and snackbar sector McDonald's dominates and
employs the most staff, followed by Burger King, FEBO established as only
national player, and Kwalitaria. Other chains in the Dutch market are
Applebee's, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Belgium
chain Quick retreated from the Dutch market in 2000.

just 7% of enterprises in the Netherlands do not plan to invest. Dutch
companies were hurt by the energy crisis in 2022 - 2023, albeit to a lower

the EU average (59%).

of trained people (71%), and high energy prices (66%). Barriers are

EU (23% versus 44%).

services to the Dutch or global market. Majority of Dutch firms are also more
technologically oriented than EU peers - almost eight out of ten Dutch firms
(78%) employed at least one digital technology in 2023. The EU average is 70%.
