The **economy of Singapore** is a highly developed mixed market economy with
dirigiste characteristics. Singapore's economy has been consistently ranked as
the most open in the world, the joint 4th-least corrupt, and the most pro-
business. Singapore has low tax-rates and the second highest per-capita GDP in
the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). The Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) is headquartered in Singapore.

Alongside the business-friendly reputation for global and local privately held
companies and public companies, various national state-owned enterprises play
a substantial role in Singapore's economy. The sovereign wealth fund Temasek
Holdings holds majority stakes in several of the nation's largest bellwether
companies, such as Singapore Airlines, Singtel, ST Engineering and Mediacorp.
With regards to foreign direct investment (FDI), the Singaporean economy is a
major FDI outflow-financier in the world. In addition, throughout its history,
Singapore has benefited from the large inward flows of FDI from global
investors, financial institutions and multinational corporations (MNCs) due to
its highly attractive investment climate along with a stable and conducive
political environment throughout its modern years.

## Overview

Singapore relies on an extended concept of intermediary trade to entrepôt
trade, by purchasing raw goods and refining them for re-export in order to
sustain its high levels of export-oriented industrialization, such as in the
wafer-fabrication industry and in oil refining. Singapore has a strategic port
which makes it more competitive than many of its neighbours in carrying out
such entrepôt activities. Singapore's trade-to-GDP ratio is among the highest
in the world, as of 2020 the ratio was 320%. The Port of Singapore is the
second-busiest in the world by cargo tonnage and is the busiest transshipment
port in the world.

Singapore is also a regional, continental and global hub for the management
and operations of various MNCs, because of its strategic location in close
proximity with other Asia-Pacific markets, along with its advanced
connectivity and infrastructure (airline hub and maritime port with a diverse
array of destinations, Gigabit fiber-optic communications, efficient road
transport and public transport) and its immigration policies in welcoming
global talent. In addition, Singapore is a popular international tourist
destination for various types of tourism (Business tourism, MICE (Meetings,
Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism, Medical tourism, Urban
tourism).

Singapore's economy is often referred to as a "miracle" due to its rapid
transformation from a developing country to a developed, high-income economy
in a relatively short period of time. This transformation took place in the
second half of the 20th century under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew and his government. One of the key factors contributing to
Singapore's economic miracle was its strategic location, which made it an
ideal hub for international trade and commerce.

The country's main exports include electronics, chemicals and services.
Singapore is the regional hub for wealth management. Water is scarce in
Singapore and a sizeable percentage of water is imported from Malaysia,
therefore it is defined as a precious resource.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Singapore's
economic landscape. In 2022 SMEs contributed 48% (S$284 bil) of Singapore's
total enterprise nominal value-added and employed 71% of Singapore's total
workforce of 3.63 million.

Singapore has limited arable land, meaning that Singapore is heavily reliant
on agrotechnology parks (particularly vertical hydroponic farms) for
agricultural production. As a result, Singapore imports 90% of its food supply
and has a wide variety of supplier countries in order to achieve its food
security; Singapore is ranked as among the most food secure in the world.

Apart from its strategic location at the cross-roads of trade between the East
and the West, Singapore has little to no natural resources, hence human
resources is a pivotal issue for the health of the Singaporean economy; the
services and manufacturing sectors of the economy are heavily reliant on a
highly-educated and highly-skilled 'Professional, Managerial, Executive and
Technical' (PMET) workforce composed of residents and expatriates. The economy
of Singapore ranked 2nd overall in the Scientific American Biotechnology
ranking in 2014, with the featuring of Biopolis.

To preserve its international standing and to further its economic prosperity
in the 21st century, Singapore has taken measures to promote innovation, to
encourage entrepreneurship and to retrain its workforce. The Ministry of
Manpower (MoM) has the prime responsibility for setting, adjusting, and
enforcing immigration rules for foreign workers, in order to achieve the dual
mandate of maximum employment of the local resident population and maximum
economic growth for the nation. Approximately 29% of the total population
within Singapore are non-resident foreigners, including 255,800 foreign
domestic workers (FDWs) who operate in Singapore.

## History

Historical GDP per capita development

### British colonization

In 1819, Stamford Raffles, at the time Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen,
established a trading post in Singapore. Raffles had been searching for a new
settlement that could be used as an outpost of the British Empire. He left
Calcutta and set out to explore much of South-East Asia. At the time, the
Dutch Empire and British Empire were close economic rivals. Colonization
enabled these empires to gain control of the vast resources of militarily
weaker and economically less prosperous nations. Raffles was looking for a new
settlement that could replace Malacca as a key economic advantage over the
Dutch Empire. The former had been handed over to the Dutch under the Treaty of
Vienna of 1815. Raffles found Singapore to be a perfect location, sitting just
of the edge of the Straits of Malacca, nowadays one of the most important
shipping lanes in the world. As well, the territory had key economic resources
which would benefit the British. There was abundant timber and fresh water,
and a natural deep water harbor which would be beneficial for the British
fleet. He arrived on an island at the mouth of the Singapore River, where
there was a small Malay settlement. At the time accompanied by William
Farquhar, Raffles met with Temenggong (essentially, Chief of Security, for the
settlement) Abdul Rahman to negotiate the right to establish a trading post on
the island, under the British Empire. The island was ruled nominally from
Johar on the peninsula by Tengku (essentially, Prince) Rahman, Sultan of
Johor, who was heavily influenced by the Dutch and the Bugis. However, the
Sultanate was weakened by factional division so that Temenggong Abdul Rahman
and his officials were more loyal to Rahman's elder brother Tengku Hussein (or
Tengku Long) who was living in exile in “Riau” (likely the Riau Archipelago).
With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Hussein back to
Singapore. He offered to recognize Hussein as the rightful Sultan of Johor and
provide him with a yearly stipend; in return, Hussein would grant the British
the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.[_citation needed_] On 6
February 1819 Raffles succeeded in having the territory formally incorporated
into the British Empire as the aforementioned trading post.[_citation needed_]
Much of the settlement’s rapid economic growth thereafter can be credited to
its natural suitability as a seaport hub.

### Trade expansion

On 17 November 1869, the Suez Canal opens, connecting the Mediterranean Sea to
the Red Sea. This allowed for a decrease in travel time, which resulted in a
rise in trade volume. The nation saw a $32 million rise just a year after its
opening.

Trade volume reached $105 million Straits dollars in 1879, during which
entrepot trade was the main source of income and trade alone accounted for
more than one-third of GDP.[_citation needed_]

### Independence

In the 1950s, the region saw social unrest which resulted in colonial powers
deciding to relinquish some decision making. With spurs of race riots the
colonial powers sought to empower and establish a formidable local government.
With most of the unrest resulting from high unemployment, the local government
was directed to solve this issue. The Economic Development Board was formed to
empower the Singapore government in establishing, developing, and financing
industrial undertakings.

In 1955, a Singapore local legislative Assembly with 25 out of 35 members
elected was formed.

Upon independence from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore faced a small domestic
market, and high levels of unemployment and poverty. 70 percent of Singapore's
households lived in badly overcrowded conditions, and a third of its people
squatted in slums on the city fringes. Unemployment averaged 14 percent, GDP
per capita was US$516, and half of the population was illiterate[_citation
needed_].

### Industrialisation boom and change

After Lee Kuan Yew was elected, he oversaw significant economic reforms to the
country. Structural change and machinery propelled the economy during his
tenure. Singapore was a small and densely populated nation, with very few
natural resources and little space to grow outwards. Recognizing this, Lee
identified that the key advantage that Singapore held was its human capital,
and its ability to provide highly educated citizens capable of competing in
global industry and trade. On 1 August 1961, the Singapore Government
established the Economic Development Board to spearhead an investment drive,
and make Singapore an attractive destination for foreign investment. FDI
inflows increased greatly over the following decades, and by 2001 foreign
companies accounted for 75% of manufactured output and 85% of manufactured
exports. Meanwhile, Singapore's savings and investment rates rose among the
highest levels in the world, while household consumption and wage shares of
GDP fell among the lowest. The beginning of Lee's tenure was marked with
success and from 1965–1973, annual growth of real GDP was 12.7%. He directed
spending to repair and improve infrastructure. This effort spurred economic
productivity and put in place the foundations needed to build up basic
industry. As of 2019, Singapore's infrastructure is ranked the best in terms
of quality, with a score of 95.4 out of 100. The period from 1973-1979 marked
a struggle for Singapore as they pivoted away from basic infrastructure
spending and moved towards more sustainable economic progress. The 1973 oil
crisis raised government awareness of issues such as economic concentration.
It forced the government to hold new forum to discuss ways of adapting the
countries economy to economic change. GDP growth during this time was slightly
lower than the preceding years, at 8.5% annually. However, unemployment was
virtually 0%, and most of the population had experienced great strides in
productivity. The government highlighted a focus in technology and education
to be the new wave of economic gain. In addition, they identified financial
services as a key area in which Singapore could diversify and attract new
growth. During this time, the government invested heavily in its budding
financial services industry. It managed to minimize inflation and provide
workers with the proper equipment and machinery to sustain growth.

### Recent history

#### Growth in the service sector

As a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33
times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.
Living standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income
status to middle-income security with increased household incomes.

In 1987, Lee claimed that (based on the government's home ownership criterion)
80% of Singaporeans could now be considered to be members of the middle-class.
Under Lee, Singapore had both low inflation and unemployment. However, much
unlike the economic policies of Greece and the rest of Europe, Singapore
followed a policy of individualising the social safety net. This led to a
higher than average savings rate and a very sustainable economy in the long
run. Without a burdensome welfare state or its likeliness, Singapore has
developed a very self-reliant and skilled workforce well versed for a global
economy.

The 1990s posed a great question for Singapore, as to how they would reinvent
their economy. The 1990s emergence of efficient manufacturing firms in
southeast Asia challenged the nation with such a small labor force and land
restrictions. Friedrich noted how " it would be "unlikely to expand beyond the
current 25% share of the economy," when regarding manufacturing firms. Despite
struggling in the manufacturing sector Singapore thrived in global finance,
trading, and was an industrial hub for international trade.

Singapore's economic strategy produced real growth averaging 8.0% from 1960 to
1999. Since the nation's independence in 1965, Singapore's GDP has amassed an
average of a 9.5% increase. The economy picked up in 1999 under Goh Chok Tong,
the Prime Minister of Singapore, after the regional financial crisis, with a
growth rate of 5.4%, followed by 9.9% for 2000. However, the economic slowdown
in the United States, Japan and the European Union, as well as the worldwide
electronics slump, had reduced the estimated economic growth in 2001 to a
negative 2.0%.

The economy expanded by 2.2% the following year, and by 1.1% in 2003 when
Singapore was affected by the SARS outbreak. Subsequently, a major turnaround
occurred in 2004 allowed it to make a significant recovery of 8.3% growth in
Singapore, although the actual growth fell short of the target growth for the
year more than half with only 2.5%. In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in
2006, 7.9%.

It was apparent that Singapore would also struggle due to the 2008 financial
crisis given its status as a financial services hub. Some market commentators
doubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis. In the
end the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2%
growth rate.

As of 8 June 2013, Singapore's unemployment rate is around 1.9% and the
country's economy has a lowered growth rate, with a rate of 1.8% on a quarter-
by-quarter basis—compared to 14.8% in 2010.

2015 and 2016 saw a downturn for the nation as GDP growth shrunk to just 2
percent. Despite growth diminishing, the nation has yet to post negative
growth rates which are a positive sign. During the same period of diminishing
economic growth. Unemployment and inflation have also decreased.

As of 2017 Singapore's GDP reached $323.907 billion.

Singapore is expected to experience an economic slowdown in 2019, with GDP
growth slowing to 1.9% from 3.1% in 2018, due to tariff hikes from the United
States and China.

During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 26 March 2020,
Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said it believed that the economy
would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank
2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019. On 26 May,
MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy
in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%. Economists had to downgrade their numbers from
previously, and some suggested that the economic recovery could take some
time. In response to the economic pressure, Moody's temporarily downgraded the
Singapore banking sector that year from "stable" outlook to a "negative"
outlook.

It was estimated by the economist Chua Hak Bin, the Singapore circuit breaker
measures in response to the pandemic, beginning on 7 April could impact the
economy to the tune of S$10 billion. With the lockdown imposed on construction
workers, there were concerns that there could be delays in construction
projects of up to six months. Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry
Chee Hong Tat announced that some 3,800 companies had closed in April 2020,
only slightly higher than the 3,700 reported on average for the same month in
the past 5 years. Though he warned that this would likely rise in the coming
months. Despite this only small increase in companies shutting down, the
number of companies starting up had declined by about a third from the average
April since 2015.

## State enterprise and investment

Singapore's State Owned Enterprises as a percent of GDP

The public sector is used both as an investor and as a catalyst for economic
development and innovation. The government of Singapore has two sovereign
wealth funds, Temasek Holdings and GIC Private Limited, which are used to
manage the country's reserves. Initially the state's role was oriented more
toward managing industries for economic development, but in recent decades the
objectives of Singapore's sovereign wealth funds have shifted to a commercial
basis.

Government-linked corporations play a substantial role in Singapore's domestic
economy. As of November 2011, the top six Singapore-listed GLCs accounted for
about 17 percent of total capitalization of the Singapore Exchange (SGX).
These fully and partially state-owned enterprises operate on a commercial
basis and are granted no competitive advantage over privately owned
enterprises. State ownership is prominent in strategic sectors of the economy,
including telecommunications, media, public transportation, defence, port,
airport operations as well as banking, shipping, airline, infrastructure and
real estate.

As of 2014, Temasek holds S$69 billion of assets in Singapore, accounting for
7% of the total capitalization of Singapore-listed companies. In 2017, GSK
shifted its Asian Headquarters to Singapore.

## Sectors

To maintain its competitive position despite rising wages, the government
seeks to promote higher value-added activities in the manufacturing and
services sectors. It also has opened, or is in the process of opening, the
financial services, telecommunications, and power generation and retailing
sectors up to foreign service providers and greater competition. The
government has also attempted some measures including wage restraint measures
and release of unused buildings in an effort to control rising commercial
rents with the view to lowering the cost of doing business in Singapore when
central business district office rents tripled in 2006.[_citation needed_]

### Banking

Singapore is considered a global financial hub by many leading financial
analysts, economists and politicians, with Singapore banks offering world-
class corporate bank account facilities. In the 2020 Global Financial Centres
Index, Singapore was ranked as having the sixth most competitive financial
sector in the world, and the fourth most competitive in Asia. These include
multiple currencies, internet banking, telephone banking, checking accounts,
savings accounts, debit and credit cards, fixed term deposits and wealth
management services. DBS, OCBC and UOB are the three major local banks of
Singapore. In 2020, MAS granted license to digital banks for the first time.
GXS Bank and MariBank are the two largest digital banks in Singapore.

Singapore has also attracted assets formerly held in Swiss banks for several
reasons, including new taxes imposed on Swiss accounts and a weakening of
Swiss bank secrecy. Credit Suisse, the second largest Swiss bank, moved its
head of international private banking to Singapore in 2005. For this, the
country has also been dubbed the "Switzerland of Asia".

### Biotechnology

Singapore has been aggressively developing its biotechnology industry. Hundred
of millions of dollars were invested into the sector to build up
infrastructure, fund research and development and to recruit top international
scientists to Singapore. Leading drug makers, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
Pfizer and Merck & Co., have set up plants in Singapore. In 2006 GSK invested
another S$300 million to build another plant to produce paediatric vaccines,
its first such facility in Asia. Pharmaceuticals now account for more than 8%
of the country's manufacturing production. In 2022, the biopharma industry of
Singapore accounted for manufacturing output of USD 18 billion a year, a value
that had tripled during two decades.

### Energy and infrastructure

Singapore is the pricing centre and leading oil trading hub in Asia. The oil
industry makes up 5% of Singapore's GDP, with Singapore being one of the top
three export refining centres in the world. In 2007, it exported 68.1 million
tonnes of oil. The oil industry has led to the promotion of the chemical
industry as well as oil and gas equipment manufacturing. Singapore has 70 per
cent of the world market for both jack-up rigs and for the conversion of
Floating Production Storage Offloading units. It has 20 per cent of the world
market for ship repair, and in 2008 the marine and offshore industry employed
almost 70,000 workers.

Singapore has limited potential for renewable energy mainly due to its small
surface area; solar power holds the greatest potential. The government set a
target of generating solar power to cover 350,000 households in 2030 that
would equal to 4% of the country's electricity demand in 2020. As a financial
hub, Singapore can play an important role in attracting investment in
renewable energy in the entire ASEAN region.

### Real estate

The Singapore government also owns 90 percent of the country's land, as well
as housing in which 80 percent of the population lives.

In July 2022, a report by Savills revealed that Singapore tied with New York
City in recording the highest rental growth rate for luxury homes globally.

### Tourism

Tourism plays an important role in the economy of Singapore. Singapore ranks
among the most visited cities in the world.

## International trade and investment

| This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to

---|---  
Singaporean exports in 2006

Singapore's total trade in 2022 amounted to $1,365.4 billion SGD. In 2022,
Singapore's imports were $655.4 billion SGD and exports were $710.0 billion
SGD. China was Singapore's main import partner, as well as its largest export
market in 2021. Singapore's major trading partners include Malaysia, the
United States and the European Union.

China is Singapore's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling
roughly 175 billion Singapore dollars in 2022. Since 2009, the value of
exports exceeds imports for Singapore's trade with China. In comparison, the
value of imports exceeds exports for Singapore's trade with the US since 2006.

Re-exports accounted for 43% of Singapore's total sales to other countries in
2000. Singapore's principal exports are electronic components, refined
petroleum, gold, computers, and packaged medications. Singapore's main imports
are electronic components, refined petroleum, crude petroleum, gold, and
computers.

Trade in Singapore has benefited from the extensive network of trade
agreements Singapore has implementing. According to Healy Consultants,
Singapore has free trade access to the entirety of the ASEAN network, with
import duty reduced when dealing with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.

The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) continues to attract investment
funds on a large-scale for the country despite the city's relatively high-cost
operating environment. The US leads in foreign investment, accounting for 40%
of new commitments to the manufacturing sector in 2000. As of 1999, cumulative
investment for manufacturing and services by American companies in Singapore
reached approximately $20 billion (total assets). The bulk of US investment is
in electronics manufacturing, oil refining and storage, and the chemical
industry. More than 1,500 US firms operate in Singapore.

Singapore's largely corruption-free government, skilled workforce, and
advanced and efficient infrastructure have attracted investments from more
than 3,000 multinational corporations (MNCs) from the United States, Japan,
and Europe. Foreign firms are found in almost all sectors of the economy. MNCs
account for more than two-thirds of manufacturing output and direct export
sales, although certain services sectors remain dominated by government-linked
corporations.

The government also has encouraged firms to invest outside Singapore, with the
country's total direct investments abroad reaching $39 billion by the end of
1998. The People's Republic of China was the top destination, accounting for
14% of total overseas investments, followed by Malaysia (10%), Hong Kong (9%),
Indonesia (8%) and US (4%). The rapidly growing economy of India, especially
the high technology sector, is becoming an expanding source of foreign
investment for Singapore.

The United States strives to improve bilateral trade with Singapore and has
signed the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement in 2003. Singapore corporate tax
is 17 per cent.

Singapore is the European Union's 14th largest trading partner. Singapore-EU
trade is worth more than €50 billion euros a year. Singapore is also the EU's
5th largest trade in services partner and the EU's 6th destination for foreign
direct investment. Over 10,000 EU companies have set up their hubs or offices
in Singapore.

In 2018, the EU and Singapore signed the EUSFTA, a free trade agreement which
aims to boost and promote trade between Singapore and the EU. The agreement
includes provisions on:

  * Eliminating tariffs on goods
  * Harmonizing safety, testing and labeling standards (for cars and vehicle parts, electronics and textiles)
  * Preferential market access and equal treatment for services (for telecommunications, financial services, transport, etc.)
  * Simplifying customs procedures and improving trade facilitation
  * Improved protection of intellectual property
  * Guaranteed access to government procurement contracts
  * Legally-binding commitments on environmental protection and workers' rights

In addition to the free trade agreement, the EU and Singapore signed an
investment protection agreement which aims to encourage investment between
Singapore and the EU. It ensures that governments in the EU and Singapore
treat each other's investors equally, and replaces old-style bilateral
investment treaties between Singapore and individual EU countries.

## Singapore workforce

In 2000, Singapore had a workforce of about 2.2 million. With limited access
to natural resources, Singapore had been forced to invest in its
people.[_citation needed_] The country has the largest proficiency of English
language speakers in Asia, making it an attractive place for multinational
corporations. Singapore has come a long way from where it once stood. In the
1970s according to Tilak Abeysinghe "2.4 percent of the labor force were
degree holders". By 1990 the number rose to just 6.3%. In 2013 the percentage
of the labor force who held degrees reached 31%. The nation's directive toward
high skilled labor jobs, has promoted both growth and education to the region.
The National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the sole trade union federation,
which has a symbiotic relationship with the ruling party, accounts for almost
99% of total organised labour. Government policy and pro-activity rather than
labour legislation controls general labour and trade union matters.[_citation
needed_]

The Employment Act offers little protection to white-collar workers due to an
income threshold. The Industrial Arbitration Court handles labour-management
disputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower.
The Singapore Government has stressed the importance of co-operation between
unions, management and government (tripartism), as well as the early
resolution of disputes. There has been only one strike in the past 15 years.

Singapore has enjoyed virtually full employment for long periods of time. Amid
an economic slump, the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% by the end of 2001, from
2.4% early in the year. Unemployment has since declined and as of 2012 the
unemployment rate stands at 1.9%.

While the Singapore government has taken a stance against minimum wage and
unemployment benefit schemes, in 2007 the government introduced a Workfare
Income Supplement (WIS) scheme to supplement wages of low-skilled workers. To
support employers in hiring older Singaporean workers, Special Employment
Credit (SEC) was introduced in 2011. It was first enhanced in 2012 to provide
employers with support in hiring older Singaporean workers and Persons with
Disabilities (PWDs). It helped the employers to cope with costs associated
with the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older
workers. The 5-year SEC scheme was further extended an additional 3 years, up
to 2019 to encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ older workers aged 65
and above. The Singapore Government and the NTUC have tried a range of
programs to increase lagging productivity and boost the labour force
participation rates of women and older workers. However, labour shortages
persist in the service sector and in many low-skilled positions in the
construction and electronics industries. Foreign workers help make up this
shortfall. In 2000, there were about 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore,
constituting 27% of the total work force. As a result, wages are relatively
suppressed or do not rise for all workers. To have some controls, the
government imposes a foreign worker levy payable by employers for low end
workers like domestic help and construction workers. In 2012, the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MTI) reported that Singapore should continue to fine-tune
the calibration of its inflow of foreigners as the country continues to face
an ageing population and a shrinking workforce. Singapore Parliament accepted
the recommendations by its Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) for the optimal
ratio of the level of immigration and foreign manpower for both high and low
skilled workers. The Government recognises that the current overall foreign
workforce should complement the local resident workforce and not replace the
Singaporean Core concept, and helps companies greatly as they raise
productivity through business restructuring and workforce retraining; raise
resident labour force participation rate.

## Poverty and economic inequality

Singapore is one of the world's wealthiest countries _per capita_ , but its
Gini coefficient is high in comparison to developed countries. Statistics on
income inequality are published by the Singapore Department of Statistics.
Without taking taxes and social transfers into account, Singapore's gini
coefficient puts the country in the medium range. Nevertheless, the country
remains on the "very high" category on the inequality-adjusted human
development index (IHDI), a ranking similar to the Human Development Index
(HDI), but with inequality also accounted for.

In October 2018, Oxfam ranked Singapore 149 out of 157 in its Commitment to
Reducing Inequality Index 2018, placing it among the bottom ten of the
countries in the index, which ranks countries based on efforts to reduce
economic inequality. In its report, Oxfam accused Singapore of practices which
encouraged "harmful tax practices", not having a universal minimum wage (apart
from janitors and security guards), and poor performance on labour rights. The
government responded to the report by claiming that it was more important to
look at "real outcomes" such as Singapore's high home ownership, health,
education, and employment, rather than public spending or tax rates, also
saying that the report "assumes that high taxation and high public expenditure
reflects commitment to combating inequality".

The government provides social support through a variety of social assistance
schemes. The Ministry of Social and Family Development runs ComCare, a program
which provides income support for low-income citizen households through
various schemes for short-to-medium term assistance, long-term assistance,
child support, and urgent financial needs. The Community Development Councils
also run various local assistance schemes within their districts. The Ministry
of Manpower runs a Silver Support Scheme which provides additional financial
support for low-income elderly with no family support. Meanwhile, the Ministry
of Health also runs MediFund to assist families that have difficulty paying
for medical bills despite government subsidies and other health financing
schemes. In addition, the National Council of Social Service coordinates a
range of 450 non-government voluntary welfare organisations to provide social
services, while raising funds through The Community Chest of Singapore.

Today, low and middle-income groups now receive 2.5 times the public subsidies
they did ten years ago.

## Public finance

Government spending in Singapore has risen since the start of the 2008
financial crisis, from around 15% of GDP in 2008 to 17% in 2012. The
government's total expenditure as a percentage of GDP ranks among the lowest
internationally and allows for a competitive tax regime. Singapore is required
under its constitution to keep a balanced budget over each term of government.
Singapore government debt is issued for investment purposes, not to fund
expenditure.

Personal income taxes in Singapore range from 0% to 22% for incomes above
S$320,000. There are no capital gains or inheritance taxes in Singapore.
Singapore's corporate tax rate is 17% with exemptions and incentives for
smaller businesses. Singapore has a single-tier corporate income tax system,
which means there is no double-taxation for shareholders.

Singapore introduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) with an initial rate of 3%
on 1 April 1994, increasing government's revenue by S$1.6 billion (US$1b,
€800m) and establishing government finances. The GST rate increased to 4% in
2003, 5% in 2004, 7% in 2007, 8% in 2023, and 9% in 2024.

The Singapore government owns two investment companies, GIC Private Limited
and Temasek Holdings, which manage Singapore's reserves. Both operate as
commercial investment holding companies independently of the Singapore
government, but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his wife Ho Ching serve as
chairman and CEO of these corporations respectively. While GIC invests abroad,
Temasek holds 31% of its portfolio in Singapore, holding majority stakes in
several of the nation's largest companies, such as Singapore Airlines,
Singtel, ST Engineering and Mediacorp. As of 2014, Temasek holds S$69 billion
of assets in Singapore, accounting for 7% of the total capitalisation of
Singapore-listed companies.

In April 2013, the country was recognised as an increasingly popular tax haven
for the wealthy due to the low tax rate on personal income, a full tax
exemption on income that is generated outside of Singapore and 69 double
taxation treaties that can minimise both withholding tax and capital gains
tax. Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy, with an estimated personal
wealth worth AU$835 million, and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo
Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore
(Blundy in 2013 and Saverin in 2012). Additionally, Australian mining magnate
Gina Rinehart owns property in Singapore and American investor Jim Rogers
moved to Singapore in 2007—Rogers has identified the 21st century as an era in
which Asia will dominate and wishes for his two daughters to learn Mandarin as
a key outcome of the relocation. Chinese Media TV celebrities Jet Li and Gong
Li have also taken up naturalised Singapore citizenship.

## Monetary policy

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and
financial regulatory authority. Its current chairman is Lawrence Wong (July
2023–present). It administers the various statutes pertaining to money,
banking, insurance, securities and the financial sector in general, as well as
currency issuance. The MAS has been given powers to act as a banker to and
financial agent of the Government. It has also been entrusted to promote
monetary stability, and credit and exchange policies conducive to the growth
of the economy.

Unlike many other central banks such as Federal Reserve System, European
Central Bank or Bank of England, MAS does not regulate the monetary system via
interest rates to influence the liquidity in the system. Instead, it chooses
to do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since
1981. In doing so it manages the Singapore dollar versus a number of
currencies that they do not reveal publicly – a Singapore dollar nominal
effective exchange rate (S$ NEER). It carries this out by intervening in the
SGD market as well as other operations in the money market. The MAS reviews
its policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is
around every 6 months. In some circumstances, such as during the COVID-19
pandemic MAS can change the date of its twice yearly meeting.

In May 2022, six major banks agreed to pay $64.5 million to resolve antitrust
allegations that they worked together to rig benchmark Singapore interest
rates. The banks involved included Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG, The
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, ING Bank N.V., Citibank
N.A. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

## Property policy

To dampen property speculation, the government imposed Additional Buyer's
Stamp Duty (ABSD) starting in December 2011. It was subsequently raised in
January 2013 and then again in July 2018. Currently for Singapore citizens
buying their first property, there is no ABSD. For their second property
onwards, they pay up to 15% ABSD. For foreigners the ABSD rate is 60% no
matter if it is the first property. And for entities it is 65%. At the same
time they raised the ABSD in 2018, the MAS tightened rules on housing loans,
by limiting the loan tenure and reducing the Loan-to-Value ratio.

## Mergers and acquisitions

16,156 mergers and acquisitions deals have been conducted in Singapore so far,
which accumulated to a total value of US$850 bil. Since 1985 there has been a
constant upward trend, disrupted only in 2002 and 2009. The most active year
in terms of numbers (926) and value (US$78 bil.) has been 2017, so there is
currently an all-time high. In general inbound and outbound deals in Singapore
are nearly equally distributed.

Here is a list of the top 10 deals with Singaporean participation inbound or
outbound:
