Uganda is endowed with significant natural resources,\nincluding ample fertile land, regular rainfall, and mineral deposits.\n\nChronic political instability and erratic economic management since the\nimplementation of self-rule has produced a record of persistent economic\ndecline that has left Uganda among of the world's poorest and least-developed\ncountries. The informal economy, which is predominantly female, is broadly\ndefined as a group of vulnerable individuals without protections in regards to\ntheir work. Women face a plethora of barriers specific to gender when\nattempting to access the formal economy of Uganda, and research revealed\nprejudice against lending to women in the informal sector. The national energy\nneeds have historically exceeded the domestic energy generation, though large\npetroleum reserves have been found in the country's west.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the Amin period, the country began a program of economic\nrecovery in 1981 that received considerable foreign assistance. From mid-1984\nonward, overly expansionist fiscal and monetary policies and the renewed\noutbreak of civil strife led to a setback in economic performance.\n\nThe economy has grown since the 1990s; real gross domestic product (GDP) grew\nat an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990â€“2015, whereas real GDP\nper capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period. During this period,\nthe Ugandan economy experienced economic transformation: the share of\nagriculture value added in GDP declined from 56% in 1990 to 24% in 2015; the\nshare of industry grew from 11% to 20% (with manufacturing increasing at a\nslower pace, from 6% to 9% of GDP); and the share of services went from 32% to\n55%."

    "text": "Ugandan export destinations in 2006\n\nSince assuming power in early 1986, Museveni's government has taken important\nsteps toward economic rehabilitation. The country's infrastructure, notably\nits transport and communications systems which were destroyed by war and\nneglect, is being rebuilt. Recognizing the need for increased external\nsupport, Uganda negotiated a policy framework paper with the IMF and the World\nBank in 1987. Uganda subsequently began implementing economic policies\ndesigned to restore price stability and sustainable balance of payments,\nimprove capacity utilization, rehabilitate infrastructure, restore producer\nincentives through proper price policies, and improve resource mobilization\nand allocation in the public sector. These so-called Structural Adjustment\nPrograms greatly improved the shape of the Ugandan economy, but did not lead\nto economic growth in the first decade after their implementation. Since 1995,\nUganda has experienced rapid economic growth, but it is not clear to what\nextent this positive development can be attributed to Structural Adjustment.\nUganda has been a member of the World Trade Organization, since January 1st\n1995 and a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, since October\n25th 1962."

Exports of apparel,\nhides, skins, vanilla, vegetables, fruits, cut flowers, and fish are growing,\nwhile cotton, tea, and tobacco continue to be mainstays.\n\nUganda produced in 2018:\n\n* 3.9 million tons of sugarcane\n* 3.8 million tons of plantain (4th largest producer in the world, losing only to Congo, Ghana and Cameroon)\n* 2.9 million tons of maize\n* 2.6 million tons of cassava\n* 1.5 million tons of sweet potato (7th largest producer in the world)\n* 1.0 million tons of bean\n* 1.0 million tons of vegetable\n* 532 thousand tons of banana\n* 360 thousand tons of onion\n* 298 thousand tons of sorghum\n* 260 thousand tons of rice\n* 245 thousand tons of sunflower seed\n* 242 thousand tons of peanut\n* 211 thousand tons of coffee (10th largest producer in the world)\n* 209 thousand tons of millet\n\nIn addition, there are smaller productions of other agricultural products,\nlike cotton (87 thousand tons), tea (62 thousand tons), tobacco (35 thousand\ntons) and cocoa (27 thousand tons)."

    "text": "As of 2017, Uganda had about 130,000 kilometres (80,778 mi) of roads, with\napproximately 5,300 kilometres (3,293 mi) (4 percent) paved. Most paved roads\nradiate from Kampala, the country's capital and largest city.\n\nAs of 2017, Uganda's metre gauge railway network measures about 1,250\nkilometres (777 mi) in length. Of this, about 56% (700 kilometres (435 mi)),\nis operational. A railroad originating at Mombasa on the Indian Ocean connects\nwith Tororo, where it branches westward to Jinja, Kampala, and Kasese and\nnorthward to Mbale, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, and Pakwach. The only railway line\nstill operating, however, is the one to Kampala.\n\nUganda's important link to the port of Mombasa is now mainly by road, which\nserves its transport needs and also those of neighboring Rwanda, Burundi,\nparts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan.\n\nAn international airport is at Entebbe on the northern shores of Lake\nVictoria, about 41 kilometres (25 mi) south of Kampala. In January 2018, the\ngovernment of Uganda began the construction of Kabalega International Airport,\nin the Western Region of Uganda. This will be Uganda's second international\nairport, which is planned to facilitate the construction of an oil refinery\nand boost tourism.\n\nThe transport union Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union (ATWGU) is\none of the more powerful trade unions in the country with about 100,000\nmembers, many of whom are informal workers."

    "text": "Uganda's predominant mineral occurrences are gold, tungsten, tin, beryl, and\ntantalite in the south; tungsten, clay, and granite between latitude zero and\ntwo degrees north; and gold, mica, copper, limestone, and iron in the north.\n\nIn late 2012, the government of Uganda was taken to court over value added tax\nthat it placed on goods and services purchased by Tullow Oil, a foreign oil\ncompany operating in the country at the time. The court case was heard at an\ninternational court based in the United States. The Ugandan government\ninsisted that Tullow could not claim taxes on supplies as recoverable costs\nbefore oil production starts. Sources from within the government reveal that\nthe main concern at present is the manner in which millions of dollars have\nbeen lost in the past decade, money that could allegedly have stayed in Uganda\nfor investment in the public sector; a Global Financial Integrity report\nrecently revealed that illicit money flows from Uganda between 2001 and 2012\ntotalled $680 million. Tullow Oil was represented in the court case by Kampala\nAssociated Advocates, whose founder is Elly Kurahanga, the President of Tullow\nUganda. A partner at Kampala Associated Advocates, Peter Kabatsi, was also\nUganda's solicitor general between 1990 and 2002, and he has denied claims\nthat he negotiated contracts with foreign oil firms during his time in this\nrole.\n\nIn June 2015, the Ugandan government and Tullow Oil settled a longstanding\ndispute regarding the amount of certain capital gains taxes that the company\nowed to the government. The government claimed that the company owed US$435\nmillion. The claim, however, was settled for US$250 million.\n\nIn April 2018, the government signed agreements with Albertine Graben Refinery\nConsortium, an International consortium led by General Electric of the United\nStates, to build a 60,000 barrels-per-day Uganda Oil Refinery in Western\nUganda. The cost of the development is budgeted at about US$4 billion."

    "section_name": "Women in the economy",
    "text": "The agriculture sector of the Ugandan economy, which composes roughly 40% of\nthe country's GDP, is largely fulfilled by women laborers, especially in\nmanaging products, marketing, and the crop sub-sector.****76% of women work in\nthe agriculture sector and roughly 66% of men do, and women provide for 80% of\nfood crops and 60% of traditional exports such as coffee or tea. In the\nformal, non-agricultural economy, men constitute 61% of the workforce, whereas\nwomen predominate the informal economy, and this can be attributed to the lack\nof equity between men and women in the country. The Uganda Bureau of\nStatistics reported, when looking at the urban workforce in 2015, 88.6% of\nwomen were employed informally, and 84.2% of men were. Women are unable to\nenter into certain sectors, especially in the formal economy, due to the\ninability to provide substantial initial funding, and remain in the trade and\nservice sectors of the economy. Comparatively, men dominate the more\nprofitable sectors, such as manufacturing. Women traders make up 70% of those\nin markets and 40% in shops in addition to dominating other sectors such as\nthe service industry, crafts, and tailoring.\n\nWomen are often undervalued in data compilation, particularly when considering\ntheir role in their domestic home lives. For example, women commonly match the\ncontribution of their husbands to their familial income, if not provide more,\nwhen taking into consideration the value of their labor and the profits made\nfrom selling excess food. Urban women on average earn between 50% and 70% of a\nhousehold's income. Women are also discredited in data collection due to\nbiases of data collectors resulting in inaccurate reports, as well as income\nbeing measured per house, rather than separating by gender. The barriers women\nface in furthering their entrepreneurial careers are different from those\nfaced by men; this is inherent in the biased culture and institutions plaguing\nUganda despite the passing of somewhat progressive policies, especially with\nthe 1985 transition of government to the National Resistance Movement\nparty.****"
