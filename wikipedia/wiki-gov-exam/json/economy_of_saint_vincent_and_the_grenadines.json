Bananas alone account for upwards of\n60% of the work force and 50% of merchandise exports in Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines. Such reliance on a single crop makes the economy vulnerable to\nexternal factors. St. Vincent's banana growers benefited from preferential\naccess to the European market. In view of the European Union's announced\nphase-out of this preferred access, economic diversification is a priority.\n\nTourism has grown to become a very important part of the economy. In 1993,\ntourism supplanted banana exports as the chief source of foreign exchange. The\nGrenadines have become a favourite of the up-market yachting crowd. The trend\ntoward increasing tourism revenues will likely continue. In 1996, new cruise\nship and ferry berths came on-line, sharply increasing the number of passenger\narrivals. In 1998, total visitor arrivals stood at 202,109 with United States\nvisitors constituting 2.7%, as most of the nation's tourists are from other\ncountries in the Caribbean and the United Kingdom. Figures from 2005 record\ntourism's contribution to the economy at US$90 million.\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin\nInitiative. The country belongs to the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which\nhas signed a framework agreement with the United States to promote trade and\ninvestment in the region.\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines electricity production by source"
