Trinidad and\nTobago is recognised as a high-income economy by the World Bank. Unlike most\nof the English-speaking Caribbean, the country's economy is primarily\nindustrial, with an emphasis on petroleum and petrochemicals. The country's\nwealth is attributed to its large reserves and exploitation of oil and natural\ngas.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site\nfor international businesses and has one of the highest growth rates and per\ncapita incomes in Latin America. Recent growth has been fueled by investments\nin liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petrochemicals. Additional petrochemical,\naluminium, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago is the largest Caribbean producer of natural gas in\nCARICOM and the second largest producer of oil after Guyana, and its economy\nis heavily dependent upon these resources. It also supplies manufactured\ngoods, notably food and beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region.\nOil and gas account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of\nemployment.",

    "text": "Trinidad and Tobago has been involved in the petroleum sector for over one\nhundred years. There has been considerable oil and gas production on land and\nin shallow water, with cumulative production totaling over three billion\nbarrels of oil. Trinidad and Tobago is the largest oil and natural gas\nproducer in the Caribbean. In the 1990s, the hydrocarbon sector moved from\nproducing mainly oil to producing mostly natural gas. According to the EIA, in\n2013, proven crude oil reserves were estimated at 728 million barrels, while\n3P natural gas reserves were 25.24 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) (Ryder Scott\nAudit 2012).\n\nTrinidad and Tobago houses one of the largest natural gas processing\nfacilities in the Western Hemisphere. The Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited\n(PPGPL) natural gas liquids (NGL) complex is located in the Port of Savonetta.\nIt has a processing capacity of almost 2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day and\nan output capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) of NGL. After processing\nthe gas is then transferred to the various power generators (POWERGEN, TGU, or\nTrinity Power) for generation of electricity and to the petrochemical plants\nfor use as a feedstock.\n\nThe electricity sector is fueled entirely by natural gas. Trinidad Generation\nUnlimited power plant, the second combined cycle plant in the country, with a\ngenerating capacity of 720MW, was opened on 31 October 2013.\n\nWith 11 ammonia plants and seven methanol plants, Trinidad and Tobago was the\nworld's largest exporter of ammonia and the second largest exporter of\nmethanol in 2013, according to IHS Global Insight. Overall production and\nexport for ammonia, methanol, urea, and UAN decreased to 428,240 metric tonnes\n(MT) in 2013 from 564,892 MT in 2012.\n\nAn oil platform off the coast of Trinidad.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Energy Affairs (MEEA) has encouraged investment in\nprojects for \"downstream\" processing of petrochemicals, such as the\nmanufacture of calcium chloride and dimethyl ether (DME). Such projects are\nexpected to generate more local employment and more growth in local\nmanufacturing than traditional petrochemical processing.\n\nThe energy sector accounts for around 45.0% of the country's GDP. The Central\nBank predicted real GDP growth in Trinidad and Tobago of 2.6% in 2014, up from\n1.6% in 2013, as the country's energy sector recovered from maintenance delays\nthat reduced activity in the third quarter of 2013.\n\nMEEA predicted that production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would rise by\n2.0% to 40.0bcm in 2014, following an estimated 1.5% drop in production in\n2013. Production of petrochemicals was also expected to rebound, following an\n8.0% drop in output in the third quarter of 2013, as several companies aligned\ntheir production schedules with the natural gas shortfall.",
