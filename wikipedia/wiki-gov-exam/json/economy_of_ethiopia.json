    "text": "The **economy of Ethiopia** is a mixed and transition economy with a large\npublic sector. The government of Ethiopia is in the process of privatizing\nmany of the state-owned businesses and moving toward a market economy. The\nbanking, telecommunication and transportation sectors of the economy are\ndominated by government-owned companies.\n\nEthiopia has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is Africa's\nsecond most populous country. Many properties owned by the government during\nthe previous regime have now been privatized or are in the process of\nprivatization and the liberalization of its financial sector in the near\nfuture. However, certain sectors such as telecommunications, financial and\ninsurance services, air and land transportation services, and retail, are\nconsidered to be strategic sectors and are expected to remain under state\ncontrol for the foreseeable future.\n\nAlmost 50% of Ethiopia's population is under the age of 18. Even though\neducation enrollment at primary and tertiary level has increased\nsignificantly, job creation has not caught up with the increased number of\nsecondary and postsecondary educational graduates. The country must create\nhundreds of thousands of jobs every year just to keep up with population\ngrowth.\n\nIn 2023, Ethiopia reached an estimated GDP of 156.1 billion nominal dollars\nand an estimated PPP of 393.85 billion dollars. This mostly comes from a\nservices-based economy with agriculture. In the latest data from 2019\nEthiopia's top trading partners globally included China, the United States,\nUAE, France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan,\nSwitzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Turkey, India, and Egypt. In 2021,\nagriculture made up 37.5% of the country's economic output, while services\n36.25% and industry made up 21.85% of the economy. Ethiopia's economy is\nranked 159th place out of 190 countries in 'Ease of doing business'. Ethiopia\nis also a part of African Continental Free Trade Area, Common Market for\nEastern and Southern Africa, Intergovernmental Authority on Development, and\nthe G24, and has observer status at the World Trade Organization. Ethiopia\njoined the BRICS economic alliance in January 2024.\n\nWhile Ethiopia does not currently have a stock exchange, it did have one in\nthe past during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie I, called an 'ākisīyoni\ngebeya.' It now has a commodity exchange in Addis Ababa called the Ethiopia\nCommodity Exchange, established in 2008.\n\nThe Ethiopian economy has a large foreign debt, with an overall external debt\nof 28 billion US dollars. China owns over 13 billion dollars of its debt. Its\ndebt to GDP ratio is smaller than similar and neighboring countries. Ethiopia\ncurrently has 2.4 billion dollars of foreign reserves, representing a decline\ncompared to previous years.\n\nEthiopia expects to reach a national middle-income status by 2025. Despite\nthis, based on the most recent data from 2019, 68.7% of the population\ncontinues to be affected by multidimensional poverty and an additional 18.4%\nvulnerable to it."

    "text": "Development of GDP per capita\n\nEthiopia's resources have enabled the country—unlike most sub-Saharan African\ncountries—to maintain contacts with the outside world for centuries. Since\nancient times, Ethiopian traders exchanged gold, ivory, musk, and wild animal\nskins for salt and luxury goods, such as silk and velvet. By the late\nnineteenth century, coffee had become one of Ethiopia's more important cash\ncrops. At that time, most trade flowed along two major trade routes, both of\nwhich terminated in the far southwest in the Kefa-Jima region. From there, one\nroute went north to Mitsiwa via Gonder and Adwa, the other along the Awash\nRiver valley to Harer and then on to Berbera or Zeila on the Red Sea.\n\nEthiopia lost its status as a great trading state after the fall of Axum. Most\nEthiopians came to despise traders, preferring instead to emulate the\ncountry's legendary warriors and priests. After establishing a foothold in the\ncountry, Greek, Armenian, and Arab traders became the economic intermediaries\nbetween Ethiopia and the outside world. Arabs also settled in the interior and\neventually dominated all commercial activity except petty trade.\n\nWhen their occupation of Ethiopia ended in 1941, the Italians left behind them\na country whose economic structure was much as it had been for centuries.\nThere had been some improvements in communications, particularly in the area\nof road building, and attempts had been made to establish a few small\nindustries and to introduce commercial farming, particularly in Eritrea, which\nItaly had occupied since 1890. But these changes were limited. With only a\nsmall proportion of the population participating in the monetized economy,\ntrade consisted mostly of barter. Wage labor was limited, economic units were\nlargely self-sufficient, foreign trade was negligible, and the market for\nmanufactured goods was extremely small.\n\nDuring the late 1940s and 1950s, much of the economy remained unchanged. The\ngovernment focused its development efforts on expansion of the bureaucratic\nstructure and ancillary services. Most farmers cultivated small plots of land\nor herded cattle. Traditional and primitive farming methods provided the\npopulation with a subsistence standard of living. In addition, many nomadic\npeoples raised livestock and moved seasonally in drier areas. The agricultural\nsector grew slightly, and the industrial sector represented a small part of\nthe total economy.\n\nBy the early 1950s, Emperor Haile Selassie I (reigned 1930–74) had renewed\ncalls for a transition from a subsistence economy to an agro-industrial\neconomy. To accomplish this task, Ethiopia needed infrastructure to develop\nresources, a material base to improve living conditions, and better health,\neducation, communications, and other services. A key element of the emperor's\nnew economic policy was the adoption of centrally administered development\nplans.\n\nThe First Five-Year Plan (1957–1961) sought to develop strong infrastructure,\nparticularly in transportation, construction, and communications, to link\nisolated regions. The Second Five-Year Plan (1962–1967) signaled the start of\na 20-year program to change Ethiopia's predominantly agricultural economy to\nan agro-industrial one. The Third Five-Year Plan (1968–1973) also sought to\nfacilitate Ethiopia's economic well-being by raising manufacturing and agro-\nindustrial performance. However, unlike its predecessors, the third plan\nexpressed the government's willingness to expand educational opportunities and\nto improve peasant agriculture.\n\nDuring the First Five-Year Plan, the gross national product (GNP) increased at\na 3.2 percent annual rate as opposed to the projected figure of 3.7 percent,\nand growth in economic sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and mining\nfailed to meet the national plan's targets. The Planning Commission never\nassessed the performance of the Second Five-Year Plan and Third Five-Year\nPlan, largely because of a shortage of qualified personnel. However, according\nto data from the Ethiopian government's Central Statistical Authority, during\nthe 1960/61 to 1973/74 period the economy achieved sustained economic growth.\nBetween 1960 and 1970, Ethiopia enjoyed an annual 4.4 percent average growth\nrate in per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Relative to its neighbors,\nEthiopia's economic performance was mixed.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Ethiopia's economy not only had started to grow but also\nhad begun to diversify into areas such as manufacturing and services. However,\nthese changes failed to improve the lives of most Ethiopians. About four-\nfifths of the population were subsistence farmers who lived in poverty because\nthey used most of their meager production to pay taxes, rents, debt payments,\nand bribes.\n\nThe 1974 revolution resulted in the nationalization and restructuring of the\nEthiopian economy. After the revolution, the country's economy can be viewed\nas having gone through four phases. Internal political upheaval, armed\nconflict, and radical institutional reform marked the 1974-78 period of the\nrevolution. There was little economic growth; instead, the government's\nnationalization measures and the highly unstable political climate caused\neconomic dislocation in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing. As a\nresult of these problems, GDP increased at an average annual rate of only 0.4\npercent.\n\nIn the second phase (1978–1980), the economy began to recover as the\ngovernment consolidated power and implemented institutional reforms. More\nimportant, security conditions improved as internal and external threats\nsubsided. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.7 percent.\n\nIn the third phase (1980–1985), the economy experienced a setback. Except for\nEthiopian fiscal year (EFY) 1982/83, the growth of GDP declined. Manufacturing\ntook a downturn as well, and agriculture reached a crisis stage, particularly\ndue to drought that lead to widespread famine.\n\nIn the fourth period (1985–1990), the economy continued to stagnate. GDP and\nthe manufacturing sector also grew during this period, GDP increasing at an\naverage annual rate of 5 percent. However, the lingering effects of the\n1984-85 drought undercut these achievements and contributed to the economy's\noverall stag.\n\nSince 1991, the Ethiopian government has embarked on a program of economic\nreform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of\ngovernment regulation. While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have\nattracted foreign direct investment.\n\nIn 2015, Ethiopia has 2,700 millionaires, a number that has more than doubled\nsince 2007. Their fortunes are mainly built-in niches of economic rents\n(banks, mines, etc.) without investing in structural and strategic sectors\n(industrial production, infrastructure, etc.) and should in no way promote\neconomic development or represent a source of competition for Western\nmultinationals.\n\nThe Ethiopian government is stepping up its efforts to attract foreign\ninvestors, particularly in the textile sector. They can now import their\nmachines without customs duties, benefit from a tax exemption for ten years,\npay rents much lower than market prices, and use very inexpensive water and\nelectricity. Major brands have established themselves in the country, such as\nDecathlon, H&M, and Huajian. These companies also benefit from a cheap labor\nforce, with a monthly salary of around 35 euros. Finally, trade agreements\nbetween Ethiopia and the European Union allow them to export duty-free."

    "text": "Coffee sorting process is huge since Ethiopia exports over a billion dollars'\nworth of coffee globally Map of economic activities in Ethiopia and Eritrea\n(1976)\n\nAs of 2023[update], agriculture accounts for almost 36% of GDP, 81 percent of\nexports, and 73 percent of the labour force. Many other economic activities\ndepend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of\nagricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly of a subsistence nature,\nand a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural\ncash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, pulses (e.g., beans),\noilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Exports are almost\nentirely agricultural commodities, with coffee as the largest foreign exchange\nearner, and its flower industry becoming a new source of revenue: for\n2005/2006 (the latest year available) Ethiopia's coffee exports represented\n0.9% of the world exports, and oilseeds and flowers each representing 0.5%.\nEthiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer. In 2000, Ethiopia's\nlivestock contributed to 19% of total GDP.\n\nAs of 2008[update], some countries that import most of their food, such as\nSaudi Arabia, have begun planning the purchase and development of large tracts\nof arable land in developing countries such as Ethiopia. This land grabbing\nhas raised fears of food being exported to more prosperous countries while the\nlocal population faces its own shortage.\n\nForest products are mainly logs used in construction. The silvicutural\nproducts are used in construction and manufacturing, and as energy sources.\nEthiopia's fisheries are entirely fresh water, as it has no marine coastline.\nAlthough total production has been continuously increasing since 2007, the\nfishing industry is a very small part of the economy. Fishing is predominantly\nartisanal. In 2014, nearly 45,000 fishermen were employed in the sector with\nonly 30% of them employed full-time.\n\nIn 2018, Ethiopia produced the following goods:\n\n* 7.3 million tons of maize (17th largest producer in the world)\n* 4.9 million tons of sorghum (4th largest producer in the world)\n* 4.2 million tons of wheat\n* 2.1 million tons of barley (17th largest producer in the world)\n* 1.8 million tons of sweet potato (5th largest producer in the world)\n* 1.4 million tons of sugar cane\n* 1.3 million tons of yam (5th largest producer in the world)\n* 988 thousand tons of broad bean\n* 982 thousand tons of millet\n* 743 thousand tons of potato\n* 599 thousand tons of vegetable\n* 515 thousand tons of chick pea (6th largest producer in the world)\n* 508 thousand tons of banana\n* 470 thousand tons of coffee (6th largest producer in the world)\n* 446 thousand tons of cabbage\n* 374 thousand tons of pea (20th largest producer in the world)\n* 322 thousand tons of onion\n* 301 thousand tons of sesame seed (7th largest producer in the world)\n* 294 thousand tons of bell pepper\n* 172 thousand tons of lentil (11th largest producer in the world)\n* 144 thousand tons of rice\n* 143 thousand tons of peanut\n* 140 thousand tons of cotton\n* 124 thousand tons of garlic\n* 102 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava)\n* 101 thousand tons of linseed (7th largest producer in the world)"

Currently, mining comprises only 1% of GDP. Gold, gemstones\n(diamonds and sapphires), and industrial minerals are important commodities\nfor the country's export-oriented growth strategy.\n\nThe country has deposits of coal, opal, gemstones, kaolin, iron ore, soda ash,\nand tantalum, but only gold is mined in significant quantities. In Salt\nextraction from salt beds in the Afar Depression, as well as from salt springs\nin Dire and Afder districts in the south, is only of internal importance and\nonly a negligible amount is exported.\n\nTantalum mining has also been profitable. It was reported that in the late\n1980s, the mineral industry lacked importance given that it contributed less\nthan 0.2 percent of Ethiopia's GDP. Mining for gold is a key development\nsector in the country. Gold export, which was just US$5 million in 2001, has\nrecorded a large increase to US$602 million in 2012. 2001 gold production\namounted to some 3.4 tons."

    "text": "Waterpower and forests are Ethiopia's main energy sources. The country derives\nabout 90 percent of its electricity needs from hydropower, which means that\nelectricity generation, as with agriculture, is dependent on abundant\nrainfall. Present installed capacity is rated at about 2000 megawatts, with\nplanned expansion to 10,000 megawatts. In general, Ethiopians rely on forests\nfor nearly all of their energy and construction needs; the result has been\ndeforestation of much of the highlands during the last three decades.

Oil exploration in\nEthiopia has been underway for decades, ever since Emperor Haile Selassie I\ngranted a 50-year concession to SOCONY-Vacuum in September 1945.\n\nRecent oil and gas discoveries across East Africa have seen the region emerge\nas a new player in the global oil and gas industry. As exciting as the huge\ngas fields of East Africa are, however, the strong decline in oil prices and\nexpectations for an L-shaped recovery with low prices over the coming years\nare increasingly challenging the economic viability of the industry in this\nregion. The reserves are estimated at 4 trillion cubic feet (110×10~~^~~ 9\nm3), while exploration for gas and oil is underway in the Gambela Region\nbordering South Sudan. The discoveries were expected to drive billions of\ndollars in annual investment to the region over the next decade. According to\nBMI estimates, the findings in the last few years are more than that of any\nother region in the world, and the discoveries are expected to continue for\nthe next few years. However, falling global oil prices are threatening the\ncommercial viability of many of these gas prospects."

Ethiopia's real gross domestic product (GDP)\ngrowth slowed down to 6.1% in 2019/20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry,\nmainly construction, and services accounted for most of the growth.\nAgriculture was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to\ngrowth slightly improved in 2019/20 compared to the previous year. Private\nconsumption and public investment explain demand-side growth, the latter\nassuming an increasingly important role."

    "text": "Share of population in extreme poverty over time The African country of\nEthiopia has made strides towards alleviating poverty since 2000 when it was\nassessed that their poverty rate was one of the greatest among all other\ncountries. The country has made great strides in different areas of the\nMillennium Development Goals including eradicating various diseases and\ndecreasing the rate of child mortality. Despite these improvements, poverty is\nstill extremely high within the country. Based on the most recent data from\n2019, 68.7% of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty and an\nadditional 18.4% vulnerable to it. One of the leading factors in driving down\npoverty was the expansion of the agricultural sector. Poor farmers have been\nable to set higher food prices to increase their sales and revenue, but this\nexpansion has come at a cost to the poorest citizens of the country, as they\ncould not afford the higher priced food. One of the biggest challenges to\nalleviating this issue is changing the structure of Ethiopia's economy from an\nagricultural-based economy to a more industry-based economy. The current\nstrategy for addressing poverty in Ethiopia is by building on existing\ngovernment systems and development programs that are already in place within\nthe country."

    "text": "Ethiopian exports in 2006\n\nUntil 2013, the major agricultural export crop was coffee, providing about\n26.4% of Ethiopia's foreign exchange earnings. In the beginning of 2014,\noilseeds exports have been more important. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian\neconomy. More than 15 million people (25% of the population) derive their\nlivelihood from the coffee sector. Other exports include live animals, leather\nand leather products, chemicals, gold, pulses, oilseeds, flowers, fruits and\nvegetables and khat (or _qat_), a leafy shrub which has psychotropic qualities\nwhen chewed. Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond\nstate control and regulation. In East Africa, over 95% of cross-border trade\nis through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle,\ncamels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti\ngenerates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million\nannually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower\nfood prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote\nregional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and\nundocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to\nspread more easily throughout the region. Furthermore, the government of\nEthiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange\nrevenues. Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.\n\nDependent on a few vulnerable crops for its foreign exchange earnings and\nreliant on imported oil, Ethiopia lacks sufficient foreign exchange. The\nfinancially conservative government has taken measures to solve this problem,\nincluding stringent import controls and sharply reduced subsidies on retail\ngasoline prices. Nevertheless, the largely subsistence economy is incapable of\nsupporting high military expenditures, drought relief, an ambitious\ndevelopment plan, and indispensable imports such as oil; it therefore depends\non foreign assistance.\n\nIn December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 billion joint venture deal with the\nMalaysian oil company, Petronas, to develop a huge natural gas field in the\nSomali Region. By the year 2010, however, implementation failed to progress\nand Petronas lost its license to develop the field, which is now being\ninvested in by Chinese company, Poly-GCL Petroleum.[_which?_] Ethiopia has\nalready begun exporting electricity to Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti.\nEarning from this has generated US$300 million annually. After the completion\nof the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) total generation of exports to\nneighboring countries is expected to bring in US$1 billion annually to the\neconomy.\n\nThe dam, which was completed in 2023, is the largest hydroelectric power plant\nin Africa as well as among the 20 largest in the world."
