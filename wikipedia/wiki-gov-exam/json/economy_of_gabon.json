    "generated_detailed_content": "The economy of Gabon has long been shaped by its strong economic ties with France, a relationship rooted in the colonial era and sustained through continued political, cultural, and financial linkages. France's influence permeates various sectors of Gabon's economy, including trade, investment, and infrastructure development, reflecting a legacy of dependency and cooperation that has persisted since Gabon gained independence in 1960. French companies have maintained significant stakes in Gabon's key industries, particularly in oil, mining, and timber, while French financial institutions continue to play a pivotal role in the country's banking and monetary systems. This enduring connection has facilitated access to French markets and capital, while also shaping Gabon's economic policies and institutional frameworks in ways that align closely with French interests and economic models. Gabon has actively sought to attract large foreign investments, positioning itself as an open and inviting destination for international capital. The government has implemented policies aimed at encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI), including offering tax incentives, establishing special economic zones, and streamlining administrative procedures for investors. This openness has resulted in substantial inflows of capital, particularly in the extractive industries such as oil, manganese, and timber, which dominate the Gabonese economy. Multinational corporations from Europe, Asia, and the Americas have played key roles in developing Gabon's natural resources, contributing to infrastructure projects and employment opportunities. The influx of foreign investment has been critical in modernizing sectors of the economy and fostering growth, though it has also raised concerns about environmental sustainability and equitable wealth distribution. A notable characteristic of Gabon's labor market is its heavy reliance on skilled foreign labor, reflecting a dependence on expatriates and imported expertise to sustain and develop its economic sectors. This reliance stems from a shortage of adequately trained local professionals and technicians, particularly in specialized fields such as petroleum engineering, mining, finance, and information technology. Consequently, a significant proportion of the workforce in key industries comprises foreign nationals who bring technical skills and managerial experience. This dynamic has implications for human capital development within Gabon, as efforts to build domestic capacity have sometimes lagged behind economic demands. The presence of foreign workers also influences social and economic structures, contributing to a cosmopolitan workforce but occasionally generating tensions related to employment opportunities and wage disparities. Agriculture, once a foundational component of Gabon's economy, has experienced a marked decline over recent decades, signaling a structural shift away from traditional farming practices toward sectors centered on resource extraction and services. Historically, subsistence and small-scale commercial agriculture provided livelihoods for a substantial portion of the population, with crops such as cassava, plantains, and yams being cultivated for local consumption. However, the expansion of oil production and mining activities, coupled with urbanization and changes in land use, have diminished agriculture's relative contribution to GDP and employment. This decline has led to increased dependence on food imports and raised concerns about rural poverty and food security. The transition reflects broader economic trends in Gabon, where natural resource wealth has driven growth but also contributed to the marginalization of the agricultural sector. On paper, Gabon boasts a per capita income that is approximately four times higher than that of most African nations, positioning it among the continent's wealthier countries in terms of average economic output per person. This elevated income level is largely attributable to the country's abundant natural resources, particularly oil, which has generated substantial revenues and contributed to a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Gabon's economic indicators suggest a standard of living that surpasses many of its regional peers, with better access to infrastructure, education, and healthcare services in urban areas. Nevertheless, this statistical measure masks significant disparities within the population and does not fully capture the uneven distribution of wealth or the quality of life experienced by all citizens. Despite Gabon's apparent wealth, the country's heavy reliance on resource extraction industries—especially petroleum—has hindered broad-based economic development and prevented much of its population from escaping extreme poverty. Approximately 30% of Gabon's inhabitants live below the poverty line, a figure that underscores the persistent socio-economic challenges faced by large segments of society. The concentration of wealth generated by oil and mineral exports has not translated into widespread improvements in income distribution, employment, or social services for the majority of Gabonese people. This paradox of resource wealth coexisting with high poverty rates is emblematic of the \"resource curse,\" where dependence on volatile commodity markets and limited economic diversification exacerbate inequality and vulnerability. The persistence of high poverty rates in Gabon, despite its resource wealth, can be partly attributed to the uneven distribution of economic benefits and wealth within the country. Wealth generated from oil and mining sectors tends to be concentrated among a small elite, including political leaders, foreign investors, and a limited domestic business class, while many rural and urban poor remain marginalized. Structural factors such as limited access to quality education, inadequate healthcare, and insufficient social safety nets contribute to this disparity. Additionally, governance challenges, including corruption and weak institutional capacity, have impeded the effective management and equitable allocation of resource revenues. These issues have fueled social tensions and highlighted the need for policies aimed at inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The employment of many foreign guest workers in Gabon further reflects the country's dependence on expatriate labor to sustain certain sectors of the economy. These guest workers, often hired on temporary contracts, fill roles in industries such as oil extraction, construction, telecommunications, and finance, where specialized skills are in demand. Their presence is facilitated by government policies that encourage the recruitment of foreign expertise to complement the domestic workforce. While this strategy supports economic growth and technological transfer, it also raises concerns about job opportunities for Gabonese nationals and the integration of foreign workers into local communities. The reliance on guest workers underscores the challenges Gabon faces in developing a fully self-sufficient labor market. Gabon maintains a free market economy that emphasizes minimal government intervention in economic activities, allowing market forces to determine production, pricing, and investment decisions. This approach is reflected in policies that promote private enterprise, competition, and openness to international trade and investment. The government has generally refrained from imposing extensive controls or regulations that would distort market dynamics, instead focusing on creating a favorable business environment through legal frameworks and infrastructure development. The free market orientation has facilitated the growth of sectors such as oil, mining, and services, attracting domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. However, the extent of market freedom is moderated by the country's reliance on resource revenues and the need to manage economic volatility. Some sources describe Gabon’s economic system as a mixed economy, combining free-market principles with a significant reliance on oil revenues that shape government spending and economic planning. In this characterization, the state plays a prominent role in managing resource wealth and directing investments in strategic sectors, while allowing private enterprise to operate with relative freedom in other areas. The mixed economy framework acknowledges the dual nature of Gabon's economic structure, where market mechanisms coexist with state intervention aimed at stabilizing the economy and promoting development. This blend reflects attempts to balance efficiency and equity, leveraging resource wealth to finance public goods and infrastructure while encouraging private sector growth. The economic system in Gabon features relatively weak centralized economic planning and government regulation, indicating limited state control over economic activities and strategic planning. Unlike economies with strong dirigiste traditions, Gabon's government has not extensively centralized decision-making or imposed comprehensive economic plans that govern production and distribution. Instead, economic policy tends to focus on managing resource revenues, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and creating conditions conducive to investment. Regulatory frameworks exist but are often less stringent compared to more heavily planned economies, allowing for flexibility and responsiveness to market conditions. This limited government intervention reflects both ideological preferences and practical considerations related to the country's economic structure and institutional capacity.",

    "generated_detailed_content": "Gabon possesses an abundance of natural resources that have historically underpinned its economy, with timber, manganese, and oil being the most prominent among them. The country's vast forested areas have made timber a significant export commodity, while its mineral wealth includes substantial manganese deposits, which have attracted mining activities over the decades. However, it is the oil sector that has played a particularly pivotal role in shaping Gabon's economic trajectory, positioning the nation as a key player within the African oil industry. By the late 20th century, Gabon had emerged as the fifth largest oil-producing country on the African continent, a status that fueled robust economic growth during that period. The discovery and exploitation of oil reserves transformed Gabon's economy from one primarily reliant on agriculture and mining to a more diversified, oil-driven system. This transition was marked by a surge in government revenues and foreign exchange earnings, which facilitated investments in infrastructure and social services. The oil industry became the backbone of Gabon's economy, accounting for approximately half of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and representing around 80% of its total exports. Such a heavy dependence on oil exports underscored the sector's critical importance to the country's fiscal health and international trade balance. Oil production in Gabon reached its zenith in 1997, with output peaking at 370,000 barrels per day (bpd). This peak was the culmination of several decades of exploration and development, including both onshore and offshore fields. However, following this high point, production levels began a gradual decline, reflecting the natural depletion of mature oil fields and challenges in discovering and developing new reserves. Despite recent offshore discoveries that have provided some optimism, these have not been sufficient to reverse the overall downward trend in production. The decline in output has had significant implications for Gabon's economy, given the sector's dominant role in government revenues and export earnings. Periods characterized by low global oil prices have exerted additional pressure on Gabon's economy, exacerbating the challenges posed by declining production. Fluctuations in oil prices directly impacted government revenues, which in turn affected public spending and economic stability. During such downturns, the government faced budgetary constraints that limited its ability to finance development projects and social programs, highlighting the vulnerabilities inherent in an economy heavily reliant on a single commodity. These economic shocks underscored the importance of diversification and the need to reduce dependence on oil revenues to achieve sustainable growth. In 2012, the oil sector in Gabon was supported by the operation of six active oil rigs within the country. This level of drilling activity reflected ongoing efforts to maintain production levels and explore new reserves, particularly in offshore areas. The presence of these rigs demonstrated the continued commitment of both the government and international oil companies to the sector, despite the challenges posed by declining output and market volatility. By 2023, Gabon's crude oil production had stabilized at approximately 200,000 barrels per day, a figure significantly lower than the peak in 1997 but indicative of ongoing production from existing fields and new developments. Recognizing the limitations of relying predominantly on oil, the Gabonese government has articulated plans to diversify the economy in response to the declining oil reserves. Diversification efforts aim to reduce the country's vulnerability to oil price shocks and resource depletion by promoting other sectors such as mining, agriculture, and services. This strategic shift is intended to foster a more resilient economic structure capable of sustaining growth and improving living standards over the long term. The government’s diversification agenda includes attracting foreign investment, enhancing infrastructure, and developing human capital to support emerging industries. One notable aspect of Gabon's diversification strategy involves the reassessment and potential development of its iron ore reserves, particularly at the Belinga site. In 2012, the government announced intentions to reevaluate the iron ore deposits at Belinga before awarding a mining concession. This move followed earlier developments in 2007 when China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) had temporarily secured rights to exploit the ore. The reassessment was aimed at ensuring the viability and scale of the reserves and determining the best approach for their development. Given the strategic importance of iron ore as a global commodity and its potential to contribute significantly to Gabon's export revenues, the Belinga project represented a critical component of the country's efforts to broaden its resource base beyond oil. Demographically, Gabon's population distribution reflects the influence of its natural environment, particularly the dense forestation that covers much of the country. Approximately 80% of the population resides in urban areas, a concentration that is largely driven by economic opportunities and infrastructure availability in cities. Libreville, the capital and largest city, is home to 59% of the total population, making it the primary urban center and economic hub of the country. This urban concentration contrasts sharply with the sparsely populated rural regions, where dense forests and limited accessibility have constrained settlement and development. The demographic pattern has implications for resource management, economic planning, and the provision of public services, as the government seeks to balance urban growth with rural development initiatives.",

    "generated_detailed_content": "In 2008, the composition of Gabon's gross domestic product (GDP) reflected a predominantly industrial economy, with industry accounting for approximately 57.2% of the total GDP. Agriculture contributed a comparatively modest 5.7%, while services comprised about 37% of the GDP. This distribution underscores Gabon's reliance on industrial activities, particularly in sectors such as petroleum extraction and mining, while the agricultural sector remained a smaller but essential component of the economy. The services sector, encompassing government, commerce, and other service-oriented activities, also played a significant role in the economic landscape. Data regarding the proportion of Gabon's population living below the poverty line was not available, indicating a gap in publicly accessible socioeconomic statistics. Similarly, detailed information on household income or consumption shares for the lowest and highest deciles of the population was not reported, making it difficult to assess income inequality or the distribution of wealth within the country. The absence of these data points suggests challenges in comprehensive poverty measurement and income distribution analysis during this period. Consumer price inflation in Gabon was estimated at 5% in 2008, reflecting moderate inflationary pressures within the economy. This rate indicated a relatively stable price environment compared to many other developing countries, contributing to predictable economic conditions for consumers and businesses alike. Inflation at this level suggested that Gabon managed to maintain price stability despite fluctuations in global commodity prices, particularly in the oil sector, which heavily influences its economy. The labor force in Gabon was estimated to comprise approximately 592,000 individuals in 2008. This workforce supported the country's economic activities across various sectors, including agriculture, industry, and services. Historical occupational data from 2000 revealed that around 60% of the labor force was engaged in agriculture, highlighting the sector's role as a primary source of employment despite its smaller contribution to GDP. Approximately 25% of workers were employed in services and government positions, while the remaining 15% were involved in industry and commerce. This distribution illustrated a labor market heavily skewed toward agriculture, even as industry dominated economic output. Unemployment in Gabon was a significant concern, with the rate estimated at 21% in 2006. This high level of unemployment indicated structural challenges in the labor market, including potential mismatches between labor supply and demand, as well as issues related to economic diversification and job creation. The unemployment rate underscored the need for policies aimed at expanding employment opportunities, particularly in sectors beyond traditional industries. Government fiscal operations in 2008 reflected a budget with revenues totaling approximately $4.46 billion, while expenditures amounted to about $2.75 billion. This fiscal surplus suggested prudent management of public finances, possibly supported by revenues from the oil sector and other natural resource extraction industries. The surplus provided the government with fiscal space to invest in development projects, social programs, or to build reserves for future economic stability. Gabon's industrial sector encompassed a diverse array of activities, including food and beverage processing, textile manufacturing, lumbering and plywood production, cement manufacturing, petroleum extraction and refining, as well as mining of manganese, uranium, and gold. Chemical production and ship repair also formed part of the industrial landscape. This diversity within the industrial base demonstrated Gabon's utilization of both its natural resources and manufacturing capabilities to sustain economic growth and employment. The industrial production growth rate in 2008 was recorded at 1.5%, indicating modest expansion within the sector. This growth rate reflected ongoing industrial development despite global economic uncertainties and fluctuations in commodity markets. The steady increase in industrial output was essential for maintaining economic momentum and supporting government revenues. Oil production constituted a cornerstone of Gabon's economy, with output estimated at 244,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2007, equivalent to 38,800 cubic meters per day (m³/d). This level of production positioned Gabon as a significant oil producer in the region, contributing substantially to export earnings and government revenues. Domestic oil consumption in the same year was approximately 13,170 bbl/d (2,094 m³/d), indicating that the majority of produced oil was destined for export rather than local use. In 2005, oil exports were estimated at 255,000 bbl/d (40,500 m³/d), underscoring Gabon's role as an oil-exporting country with a strong presence in international energy markets. Oil imports during that year were minimal, approximately 2,485 bbl/d (395.1 m³/d), reflecting the country's self-sufficiency in petroleum products and its status as a net exporter. The relatively small volume of imports likely consisted of specialized refined products or equipment related to the oil industry. Proven oil reserves as of 1 January 2008 were estimated at 2 billion barrels, or 320 million cubic meters (m³), indicating substantial remaining hydrocarbon resources. These reserves provided a foundation for continued oil production and export activities, although the finite nature of these resources underscored the importance of economic diversification for long-term sustainability. Natural gas production in 2006 was approximately 100 million cubic meters (cu m), with consumption matching production levels, suggesting a balanced domestic market for natural gas. There were no reported exports or imports of natural gas in 2007, indicating that Gabon's natural gas sector was primarily oriented toward meeting internal energy needs rather than international trade. Proven natural gas reserves as of 1 January 2008 were estimated at 28.32 billion cubic meters (bcm), representing a significant resource base for potential future development in power generation or industrial use. Electricity production in Gabon reached approximately 1.671 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2006, reflecting the country's capacity to generate electrical power to support residential, commercial, and industrial consumption. The electricity generation mix in 1998 was heavily weighted toward hydroelectric sources, which accounted for 72.2% of total generation, while fossil fuels contributed 27.8%. Nuclear and other sources did not contribute to electricity generation, indicating reliance on renewable hydroelectric power and fossil fuel-based thermal plants. Electricity consumption in 2006 was approximately 1.365 gigawatt-hours (GWh), a figure that suggests a gap between production and consumption, possibly attributable to transmission losses, exports, or storage. However, Gabon reported no electricity exports in 2006 and no imports in 1998, indicating that the country was largely self-sufficient in meeting its electricity demand without engaging in cross-border electricity trade. Agricultural production in Gabon included a variety of crops and products such as cocoa, coffee, sugar, palm oil, rubber, cattle, okoume (a tropical hardwood species), and fish. These products represented both subsistence and commercial agricultural activities, contributing to rural livelihoods and export earnings. The presence of okoume highlighted Gabon's forestry resources, which have been important for the timber industry. The current account balance in 2010 was approximately $591 million, indicating a surplus that reflected positive net exports of goods and services, income receipts, and transfers. This surplus suggested that Gabon was generating more foreign exchange than it was spending abroad, a favorable position for economic stability and external debt management. The official currency of Gabon is the Communauté financière africaine franc (CFAF), which is subdivided into 100 centimes. The CFA franc has been used as the national currency, facilitating trade and financial transactions within Gabon and other member countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. Exchange rates for the CFA franc against the US dollar have fluctuated over the years. In 2010, the rate was 507.71 CFA francs per US dollar, while in 2009 it was 472.19, and in 2008 it stood at 447.81. Earlier rates included 481.83 in 2007, 522.89 in 2006, and a notably higher rate of 647.25 in January 2000. Rates in the late 1990s varied as well, with 615.70 in 1999, 589.95 in 1998, 583.67 in 1997, 511.55 in 1996, and 499.15 in 1995. These fluctuations reflected changes in the value of the US dollar relative to the CFA franc and global economic conditions. Since 1 January 1999, the CFA franc has been pegged to the euro at a fixed rate of 655.957 CFA francs per euro. This peg has provided exchange rate stability and facilitated trade and investment between Gabon and the Eurozone countries. The fixed exchange rate regime has been a cornerstone of monetary policy in Gabon and other CFA franc zone countries, helping to control inflation and maintain economic stability.",

    "generated_detailed_content": "The economic statistics of Gabon from 1980 to 2018 reveal a dynamic trajectory marked by fluctuations in key indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GDP per capita, nominal GDP, inflation rates, government debt, and GDP growth. In 1980, Gabon's economy was characterized by a GDP of approximately 6.78 billion US dollars measured in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), reflecting the relative value of goods and services produced within the country adjusted for price level differences. At that time, the GDP per capita stood at 9,056 US dollars PPP, indicating the average economic output per person when adjusted for purchasing power. The nominal GDP, representing the market value of all final goods and services at current prices without adjustment for inflation, was recorded at 4.56 billion US dollars, providing a baseline for economic comparison in subsequent years. By 1985, Gabon experienced a substantial increase in its GDP, which rose to 9.89 billion US dollars PPP, signaling a period of economic expansion. Correspondingly, the GDP per capita increased to 11,853 US dollars PPP, suggesting improvements in average individual economic welfare. However, despite these positive trends in PPP terms, the nominal GDP decreased to 3.74 billion US dollars, reflecting possible currency valuation changes or price level adjustments in the domestic economy. This divergence between PPP and nominal figures highlights the complexity of economic measurement and the influence of external factors such as exchange rates and inflation on nominal values. The year 1990 marked further growth in Gabon's economy, with the GDP reaching 12.00 billion US dollars PPP and GDP per capita climbing to 12,903 US dollars PPP. The nominal GDP also increased significantly to 6.34 billion US dollars, indicating a strengthening economy in current price terms. Inflation during this period was recorded at 5.1%, a moderate level that could reflect controlled price increases within the economy. Government debt as a percentage of GDP was relatively low at 15.4%, suggesting a manageable fiscal position and potential for sustainable public finance management. In 1995, Gabon's GDP expanded to 15.76 billion US dollars PPP, with the GDP per capita rising to 14,788 US dollars PPP, reflecting continued economic growth and rising average income levels. The nominal GDP, however, declined to 5.28 billion US dollars, which may be attributed to exchange rate fluctuations or changes in domestic price levels. Inflation remained stable at 5.0%, indicating consistent price stability over the five-year period. Notably, government debt surged to 73% of GDP, a significant increase from 1990, which could indicate increased borrowing or fiscal deficits during this period, potentially impacting the country's economic stability and creditworthiness. Entering the new millennium in 2000, Gabon's GDP was approximately 17.35 billion US dollars PPP, with a GDP per capita of 14,395 US dollars PPP, showing a steady upward trend in economic output and average income. The nominal GDP was reported at 5.40 billion US dollars, a slight increase from 1995, suggesting modest growth in current price terms. Inflation was negative at −1.9%, indicating a period of deflation where the general price level decreased, which can have mixed effects on economic activity. Government debt remained high at 72% of GDP, maintaining the elevated fiscal burden observed in the mid-1990s. By 2005, Gabon's economy had grown further, with GDP reaching 20.35 billion US dollars PPP and GDP per capita at 14,923 US dollars PPP, reflecting incremental improvements in economic performance and living standards. The nominal GDP saw a significant rise to 9.47 billion US dollars, nearly doubling the figure from 2000, which may be linked to favorable commodity prices or increased economic activity. Inflation was slightly negative at −0.8%, continuing the deflationary trend observed earlier. Government debt showed a marked decrease to 49% of GDP, indicating improved fiscal management and a reduction in the debt burden relative to the size of the economy. In 2006, the GDP experienced a modest increase to 20.58 billion US dollars PPP, while the GDP per capita slightly decreased to 14,720 US dollars PPP, suggesting a stable but cautious economic environment. The nominal GDP rose to 10.16 billion US dollars, reflecting ongoing growth in current price terms. Inflation remained negative at −1.9%, consistent with the deflationary pressures experienced in the preceding years. Government debt further declined to 40% of GDP, underscoring continued efforts to reduce public indebtedness and strengthen fiscal sustainability. The year 2007 saw Gabon's GDP rise to 22.46 billion US dollars PPP, accompanied by an increase in GDP per capita to 15,601 US dollars PPP, indicating enhanced economic output and improved average income levels. Nominal GDP reached 12.46 billion US dollars, demonstrating robust growth in market value terms. The economy grew at a rate of 6.3%, reflecting strong expansionary momentum. Inflation was negative at −1.0%, suggesting mild deflationary conditions. Government debt remained relatively low at 39% of GDP, maintaining a favorable fiscal position. In 2008, the GDP increased to 23.30 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita holding steady at 15,590 US dollars PPP, suggesting sustained economic performance. The nominal GDP rose significantly to 15.57 billion US dollars, possibly influenced by commodity price dynamics or currency valuation effects. GDP growth slowed to 1.7%, indicating a deceleration compared to the previous year. Inflation declined sharply to −5.3%, marking a period of pronounced deflation that could have affected consumer spending and investment. Government debt was reduced substantially to 20% of GDP, reflecting a strong fiscal consolidation effort. The global economic downturn impacted Gabon in 2009, as evidenced by a slight decrease in GDP to 22.94 billion US dollars PPP and a drop in GDP per capita to 14,789 US dollars PPP. Nominal GDP contracted to 12.19 billion US dollars, reflecting the adverse effects of the global financial crisis on the country's economy. GDP growth was negative at −2.3%, signaling economic contraction. Inflation rose to 1.9%, indicating a reversal from deflationary trends. Government debt increased to 26% of GDP, possibly due to countercyclical fiscal measures aimed at mitigating the recessionary impact. By 2010, Gabon's economy demonstrated recovery, with GDP climbing to 24.68 billion US dollars PPP and GDP per capita increasing to 15,326 US dollars PPP. Nominal GDP rose to 14.38 billion US dollars, reflecting renewed economic activity. The GDP growth rate rebounded to 6.3%, indicating a strong post-crisis expansion. Inflation moderated to 1.4%, suggesting stable price conditions. Government debt decreased to 21% of GDP, highlighting efforts to restore fiscal balance following the crisis. In 2011, the upward economic trend continued as GDP reached 26.97 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita rising to 16,138 US dollars PPP. Nominal GDP increased significantly to 18.21 billion US dollars, reflecting robust economic growth. The GDP growth rate accelerated to 7.1%, marking one of the highest rates in the observed period. Inflation remained low at 1.3%, indicating controlled price increases. Government debt remained stable at 21% of GDP, maintaining fiscal discipline. The year 2012 saw further economic expansion, with GDP rising to 28.91 billion US dollars PPP and GDP per capita reaching 16,665 US dollars PPP. Nominal GDP was recorded at 17.18 billion US dollars, slightly lower than the previous year, possibly due to price adjustments or exchange rate effects. GDP growth slowed to 5.3%, yet remained positive. Inflation increased to 2.7%, reflecting moderate price pressures. Government debt held steady at 21% of GDP, indicating continued fiscal stability. In 2013, Gabon's GDP attained 31.00 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita increasing to 17,196 US dollars PPP, demonstrating ongoing economic growth. Nominal GDP rose to 17.60 billion US dollars, signaling positive market value expansion. GDP growth was recorded at 5.5%, consistent with the previous year's performance. Inflation decreased to 0.5%, indicating subdued price pressures. Government debt increased to 31% of GDP, suggesting a rise in public borrowing or fiscal deficits. The 2014 data reflected a GDP of 32.96 billion US dollars PPP and a GDP per capita of 18,020 US dollars PPP, continuing the upward trajectory in economic output and average income. Nominal GDP was stable at 18.21 billion US dollars. GDP growth slowed to 4.4%, indicating a moderation in economic momentum. Inflation rose to 4.5%, marking a notable increase in price levels. Government debt increased further to 34% of GDP, reflecting a growing fiscal burden. In 2015, Gabon's GDP grew to 34.61 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita reaching 18,655 US dollars PPP, signifying continued economic expansion. However, nominal GDP decreased to 14.39 billion US dollars, possibly due to declining commodity prices or currency depreciation. GDP growth slowed to 3.9%, reflecting a deceleration in economic activity. Inflation was slightly negative at −0.1%, indicating near-zero deflation. Government debt rose sharply to 45% of GDP, highlighting increased fiscal pressures. The 2016 figures showed GDP at 35.78 billion US dollars PPP and GDP per capita at 19,017 US dollars PPP, maintaining the trend of gradual growth. Nominal GDP declined slightly to 14.02 billion US dollars, consistent with the previous year's downward nominal trend. GDP growth slowed further to 2.1%, indicating subdued economic performance. Inflation rose to 2.1%, reflecting moderate price increases. Government debt surged to 64% of GDP, marking a significant increase in public indebtedness. In 2017, Gabon's GDP reached 36.73 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita at 19,254 US dollars PPP, showing modest economic growth. Nominal GDP increased to 14.92 billion US dollars, suggesting some recovery in current price terms. GDP growth was marginal at 0.8%, indicating near stagnation. Inflation rose to 3.0%, marking a continued upward trend in price levels. Government debt slightly decreased to 61% of GDP, reflecting minor fiscal adjustments. The 2018 data indicated a GDP of 40.78 billion US dollars PPP, with GDP per capita increasing to 20,123 US dollars PPP, highlighting ongoing economic expansion. Nominal GDP rose to 16.83 billion US dollars, signaling improvement in market value terms. GDP growth was modest at 0.4%, suggesting a slow but positive economic trajectory. Inflation moderated to 2.0%, indicating controlled price increases. Government debt was recorded at 62% of GDP, maintaining a high but relatively stable fiscal debt burden. Together, these statistics illustrate Gabon's economic evolution over nearly four decades, marked by periods of growth, contraction, inflationary and deflationary phases, and shifting fiscal dynamics.",
