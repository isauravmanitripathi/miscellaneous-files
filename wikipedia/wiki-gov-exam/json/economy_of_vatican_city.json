of\nstamps, coins, medals, and tourist mementos as well as fees for admission to\nmuseums and publication sales. Vatican City employed 4,822 people in 2016.\n\nThe Vatican City receives subsidies from the Italian state, which include the\nwater supply free of charge, tax exemptions and other kinds of dedicated\npublic funding.\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its\ncurrency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European\nUnion (council decision 1999/98). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1\nJanuary 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-\ndenominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than\nusual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy. Because\nof their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.\n\n|  |   \n---|---|---  \n  \nVatican euro coins with images of Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI",
