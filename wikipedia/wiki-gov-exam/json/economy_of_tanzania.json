Tanzania's\neconomy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a market economy\nsince 1985. Although the total GDP has increased since these reforms began,\nGDP per capita dropped sharply at first, and only exceeded the pre-transition\nfigure in around 2007.\n\nFollowing the rebasing of the economy in 2014, the GDP increased by a third to\n$58.1 billion.\n\nIn 2020, the real GDP of Tanzania grew by 4.8% reaching US$89.5 billion versus\nUS$82.9 billion in 2019. This growth made it the 2nd largest economy in East\nAfrica after Kenya, and the 7th largest in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIt has sustained relatively high economic growth compared to global trends, as\nis characteristic of African nations. According to World Bank data, the last 5\nyears have seen the slowest growth since 2000. The medium-term outlook is so\nfar positive, with growth projected at 6 percent in 2020/21, which is\nsupported by large infrastructure spending.\n\nThe World Bank (WB) expects the economic growth of Tanzania to slow to 2.5% in\n2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected the labor market, the\nproduction capacity, and productivity. Tourism has halted, and exports of\nmanufacturing and agricultural goods slumped.\n\nOn 7 September 2021, the IMF approved US$567.25 million in emergency financial\nassistance to support Tanzania’s efforts in responding to the COVID-19\npandemic by addressing the urgent health, humanitarian, and economic costs.\n\nThe IMF projects a GDP growth for Tanzania of +4.0% and +5.1% in 2021 and\n2022, and 6.0% in 2026.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the GDP of Tanzania expanded by 4.6% in 2022, up\nfrom 4.3% in 2021.\n\nThe value of Tanzania's GDP at current prices reached USD 105.1 billion in\n2022.\n\nThe World Bank projects Tanzania's GDP growth to reach 5.1% in 2023.",

The program\nincluded a comprehensive package of policies which reduced the budget deficit\nand improved monetary control, substantially depreciated the overvalued\nexchange rate, liberalized the trade regime, removed most price controls,\neased restrictions on the marketing of food crops, freed interest rates, and\ninitiated a restructuring of the financial sector.

The IMF's PSI\nprogram provides policy support and signaling to participating low-income\ncountries and is intended for countries that have usually achieved a\nreasonable growth performance, low underlying inflation, an adequate level of\nofficial international reserves, and have begun to establish external and net\ndomestic debt sustainability.\n\nTanzania also embarked on a major restructuring of state-owned enterprises.\nThe program has so far divested 335 out of some 425 parastatal entities.\nOverall, real economic growth has averaged about 4 percent a year, much better\nthan the previous 20 years, but not enough to improve the lives of average\nTanzanians. Also, the economy remains overwhelmingly donor-dependent.\nMoreover, Tanzania has an external debt of $7.9 billion. The servicing of this\ndebt absorbs about 40 percent of total government expenditures. Tanzania has\nqualified for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\n(HIPC) initiative. Debts worth over $6 billion were canceled following\nimplementation of the Paris Club 7 Agreement.",

The value of\nnatural gas actually produced in 2013 was US$52.2 million, a 42.7 percent\nincrease over 2012.\n\nCommercial production of gas from the Songo Songo Island field in the Indian\nOcean commenced in 2004, thirty years after it was discovered there. Over 35\nbillion cubic feet of gas was produced from this field in 2013, with proven,\nprobable, and possible reserves totalling 1.1 trillion cubic feet. The gas is\ntransported by pipeline to Dar es Salaam. As of 27 August 2014, TANESCO owed\nthe operator of this field, Orca Exploration Group Inc., US$50.4 million, down\nfrom US$63.8 million two months earlier.\n\nA newer natural gas field in Mnazi Bay in 2013 produced about one-seventh of\nthe amount produced near Songo Songo Island but has proven, probable, and\npossible reserves of 2.2 trillion cubic feet. Virtually all of that gas is\nbeing used for electricity generation in Mtwara.\n\nThe Indian Ocean, off the coast of Mozambique and Tanzania, is proving to be a\nrich hunting ground for natural gas exploration. According to US Geological\nSurvey estimates, the combined gas reserves of Mozambique and Tanzania could\nbe as high as 250 trillion cubic feet. In Mozambique alone, proven gas\nreserves have increased dramatically from a mere 4.6 trillion cubic feet in\n2013 to 98.8 trillion cubic feet as of mid-2015. Given continued offshore\ndiscoveries and the size of discoveries to date, continued growth in proven\ngas reserves is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nIn 2014, Tanzania's natural gas production was 19 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a\n30% decline from five years prior, but increased in mid-2015 following the\ncommencement of operations at the Mnazi Bay Concession and a new pipeline to\nDar es Salaam. Significant gas discoveries, including 16 to 17 trillion cubic\nfeet (Tcf) by the BG Group and partners, and 22 Tcf by Statoil with\nExxonMobil, have positioned Tanzania to potentially become an LNG exporter.\nHowever, development plans, including an LNG plant agreed upon in 2014 with\ninternational companies and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation\n(TPDC), have not advanced to sanctioning.\n\nNew exploration on more frontier blocks, however, will likely be slowed as oil\nand gas prices fall and companies apply increasing caution to investing in\nfrontier markets with nascent industries, poor infrastructure and long lead\ntimes.\n\nThe exploration and development of natural gas in Tanzania have boosted its\neconomic framework. In 2024, the Ntorya gas field received a 25-year\ndevelopment license, a major step in harnessing Tanzania's natural gas.\nManaged by ARA Petroleum Tanzania Limited (APT), this field is expected to\nbegin producing substantial gas quantities for domestic use within a year.\nInitial production is projected at 40 million cubic feet per day, with\npotential expansion to 140 million cubic feet per day in future years.",
