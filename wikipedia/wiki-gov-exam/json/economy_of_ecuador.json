    "text": "The **economy of Ecuador** is the eighth largest in Latin America and the 69th\nlargest in the world by total GDP. Ecuador's economy is based on the export of\noil, bananas, shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money\ntransfers from Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad. In 2017, remittances\nconstituted 2.7% of Ecuador's GDP. The total trade amounted to 42% of the\nEcuador's GDP in 2017.\n\nThe country is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources. In 2017,\noil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 32% of export\nearnings. When Ecuador was part of OPEC, it was one of the smallest members\nand produced about 531,300 barrels per day of petroleum in 2017. It is the\nworld's largest exporter of bananas ($3.38 billion in 2017) and a major\nexporter of shrimp ($3.06 billion in 2017). Exports of non-traditional\nproducts such as cut flowers ($846 million in 2017) and canned fish ($1.18\nbillion in 2017) have grown in recent years.\n\nIn the past, Ecuador's economy depended largely on primary industries like\nagriculture, petroleum, and aquaculture. As a result of shifts in global\nmarket trends and development of technology, the country has experienced\neconomic development in other sectors, such as textiles, processed food,\nmetallurgy and the service sectors. Between 2006 and 2014, GDP growth averaged\n4.3%, driven by high oil prices and external financing. From 2015 until 2018,\nGDP growth averaged just 0.6%. Ecuador's ex-president, Lenín Moreno, launched\na radical transformation of Ecuador's economy after taking office in May 2017.\nThe aim was to increase the private sector's weight, in particular the oil\nindustry."

    "text": "Oil accounts for 40% of exports and contributes to maintaining a positive\ntrade balance. Since the late '60s, the exploitation of oil increased\nproduction and reserves are estimated at 4.036 million barrels\n\nIn the agricultural sector, Ecuador is a major exporter of bananas (the\nlargest exporter of bananas in the world), cut flowers, cacao, coffee, shrimp,\nwood, and fish. It is also significant in shrimp production, sugar cane, rice,\ncotton, corn, palm and coffee.[_citation needed_] The country's vast resources\ninclude large amounts of timber across the country, like eucalyptus and\nmangroves. Pines and cedars are planted in the region of the Sierra, walnuts\nand rosemary, and balsa wood, on Guayas River Basin.[_citation needed_]\n\nEcuador's tobacco is prized in the cigar industry due to the prolonged cloud\ncover and rich volcanic soil creating ideal growing conditions, especially for\nshade tobacco and Ecuadorian Sumatra Tobacco cigar wrapper leaves; exports\ntopped $70M in 2018.\n\n**Oil Industry in Ecuador** Ecuador's oil industry is a cornerstone of its\neconomy, contributing significantly to export earnings and government\nrevenues. As of 2023, the country holds approximately 8.3 billion barrels of\nproven crude oil reserves . In 2022, crude oil accounted for about 27% of\nEcuador's total export value, with major export destinations including Latin\nAmerica, North America, and Asia.\n\nThe state-owned company Petroecuador plays a pivotal role in the oil sector,\noften operating in partnership with private and foreign corporations . Recent\ninitiatives aim to boost oil production through foreign investments, with\nplans to attract approximately $42 billion in the oil sector by 2029 .\n\nHowever, oil extraction has raised environmental and social concerns,\nparticularly in the Amazon region. In 2023, a national referendum led to the\ncessation of oil drilling in Block 43 within Yasuni National Park, a\nbiodiverse area home to Indigenous communities.\n\n**Agricultural Sector in Ecuador** Agriculture remains a vital component of\nEcuador's economy, accounting for a significant portion of exports. The\ncountry is the world's largest exporter of bananas, with exports valued at\napproximately $2 billion . Other major agricultural exports include shrimp,\ncacao, coffee, and cut flowers. In 2020, agricultural products represented\nabout 41.1% of Ecuador's total export.\n\nEcuador's diverse climate and fertile soil enable the cultivation of various\ncrops, including rice, sugar cane, cotton, corn, and palm. The country's\nforestry resources, such as eucalyptus, mangroves, pine, cedar, and balsa\nwood, also contribute to its export economy.\n\nThe industry is concentrated mainly in Guayaquil, the largest industrial\ncenter, and in Quito, where in recent years the industry has grown\nconsiderably. This city is also the largest business center of the country.\nIndustrial production is directed primarily to the domestic market.[_citation\nneeded_] Despite this, there is limited export of products produced or\nprocessed industrially.[_citation needed_] These include canned foods, liquor,\njewelry, furniture, and more.[_citation needed_] Minor industrial activity is\nalso concentrated in Cuenca.\n\nThe dairy industry is represented by companies such as Tonicorp, which is\nowned by the Coca Cola Company."

The remaining 1,390 MW are not part of the countrywide grid;\n* National Transmission System (SNT) with line voltages 500 kilovolt (kV), 230 kV and 138 kV, 4,382 km of single-circuit lines and 2,462 km of double-circuit lines, including\n* interconnection with Colombia (two 230 kV Jamondino-Pomasqui double-circuit lines and a 138 kV Tulcán-Panamericana single-circuit line);\n* interconnection with Peru (a 230 kV Machala-Zorritos double-circuit line).\n\nDistribution is provided through distribution companies with total billing of\n2 billion US dollars and electricity losses of 13.25%. As of December 2022,\nthey managed:\n\n* 370 substations with total capacity of 8,545 megavolt-amperes (MVA)\n* 67 sectioning substations;[_clarification needed_]\n* 5,730 km of subtransmission[_clarification needed_] lines;\n* 111,276 km of medium voltage lines;\n* 105,469 km of low voltage lines\n* 360,000 distribution transformers with a total capacity of 14,100 MVA;\n* 5.56 million electrical meters (coverage of 97.4%).\n\nThe peak demand on the SNI grid occurs in April (4,388 MW in 2022). The total\ngeneration in 2022 was 33 terawatt-hours (TWh) with 87% delivered by SNI and\nthe rest by provider unincorporated into the grid. The breakdown by the power\nsource at the SNI was as follows:\n\n* hydroelectric 24.6 TWh (85.3%);\n* fossil fuel 3.8 TWh (13%);\n* biomass 0.35 TWh (1.2%);\n* solar photovoltaic, biogas, wind energy less than 1% combined.\n\nThe amount of reported unavailable generation capacity varied between 1,170\nand 1,610 GW in 2019-2022, approximately evenly split between hydro and\nthermal power stations. The plan of r2023-2032 called for major expansion of\nthe generation capacity, primarily renewable energy (additional 6,300 MW), but\nwith 700 MW of \"firm\" (thermal) capacity scheduled to come on-line in\n2024-2025. This \"firm\" generation was intended for the electric grid security\nand \"quality of supply\".\n\nDuring the 2023-2024 Ecuador electricity crisis, in the fall of 2024, the\namount of thermal generation was significantly lower than the numbers above\nwould suggest. For example, according to Miguel Calahorrano, an ex-minister of\nelectricity and renewable energy, only Trinitaria (125 MW), Machala Gas (125\nMW), G. Zevallos (146 MW) and Jaramijó (140 MW) were operating at high power\nuntil October 15, 2024."

    "text": "Deteriorating economic performance in 1997–98 culminated in a severe financial\ncrisis in 1999. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks,\nincluding the El Niño weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global oil\nprices in 1997–98, and international emerging market instability in 1997–98.\nThese factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic\npolicy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted\nin a 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a\n65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999.\n\nOn January 9, 2000, the administration of President Jamil Mahuad announced its\nintention to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency of Ecuador to\naddress the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the 2000\nEcuadorean coup d'état which saw Mahuad's removal from office and the\nelevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency.\n\nUS Dollar has been the only official currency of Ecuador since the year 2000.\n\nThe Noboa government confirmed its commitment to convert to the dollar as the\ncenterpiece of its economic recovery strategy, successfully completing the\ntransition from sucres to dollars in 2001. Following the completion of a one-\nyear stand-by program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December\n2001, Ecuador successfully negotiated a new $205 million stand-by agreement\nwith the IMF in March 2003.\n\nBuoyed by higher oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest\nrecovery in 2000–01, with GDP rising 2.3% in 2000 and 5.4% in 2001. GDP growth\nleveled off to 2.7% in 2002. Inflation fell from an annual rate of 96.1% in\n2000 to an annual rate of 37.7% in 2001; 12.6% for 2002.\n\nThe completion of the second Transandean Oil Pipeline (OCP in Spanish) in 2003\nenabled Ecuador to expand oil exports. The OCP will double Ecuador's oil\ntransport capacity.\n\nEcuador's economy is the eighth largest in Latin America and experienced an\naverage growth of 4.6% per year between 2000 and 2006. In January 2009, the\nCentral Bank of Ecuador (BCE) put the 2010 growth forecast at 6.88%. GDP\ndoubled between 1999 and 2007, reaching 65,490 million dollars according to\nBCE. Inflation rate up to January 2008 was located about 1.14%, the highest\nrecorded in the last year, according to Government. The monthly unemployment\nrate remained at about 6 and 8 percent from December 2007 until September\n2008, however, it went up to about 9 percent in October and dropped again in\nNovember 2008 to 8 percent.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2009, the government increased spending on social welfare and\neducation from 2.6% to 5.2% of its GDP. Starting in 2007, when its economy was\nsurpassed by the economic crisis, Ecuador was subject to a number of economic\npolicy reforms by the government that have helped steer the Ecuadorian economy\nto a sustained, substantial, and focused achievement of financial stability\nand consistent social policy. [_vague_] Such policies were expansionary fiscal\npolicies, of access to housing finance, stimulus packs, and limiting the\namount of money reserves banks could keep abroad. The Ecuadorian government\nhas made huge investments in education and infrastructure throughout the\nnation, which have improved the lives of the poor.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, President Rafael Correa announced that Ecuador would not\npay $30.6m in interest to lenders of a $510m loan, claiming that they were\nmonsters. In addition it claimed that $3.8bn in foreign debt negotiated by\nprevious administrations was illegitimate because it was authorized without\nexecutive decree. At the time of the announcement, the country had $5.65bn in\ncash reserves.\n\nIn 2009, economic growth declined to 0.6% during the global recession,\naccompanied by falling oil prices and a decline in remittances provided by\nEcuadorians living and working abroad (a major source of external revenues).\nShowing signs of recovery in 2010, the economy rebounded and grew by 2.8%.\nAfter growth of 7.4% in 2011, Ecuador's growth averaged 4.5% from 2012 to\n2014.\n\nSome observers have attributed the high growth to a public investment boom\nthat was fueled by high oil prices and lending from China. According to the\nU.S. Energy Information Administration, Ecuador was the third largest source\nof foreign oil to the western United States in 2014. However, in the middle of\n2014 after the price of oil declined significantly, Ecuador's oil earnings\nfell. As a consequence, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecast that\nEcuador's economy would contract slightly in 2015, although the economy\nultimately grew by less than half a percent. President Correa's plans to begin\nextracting crude oil from the Ishpingo, Tambochoa, and Tiputini field in\nYasuní National Park in the Amazon to provide an economic boost did not\nsalvage the economy from going into recession. In 2016, Ecuador's gross\ndomestic product contracted by 1.6%.\n\nEcuador's economic slowdown in 2016 and the country's need for external\nfinance were exacerbated by a deadly April 2016 earthquake. Ecuador's\nestimated $3 billion costs for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance for\n720,000 people in the affected region remain a burden that the government and\nprivate sector have sought to address. In response, the U.S. Office of Foreign\nDisaster Assistance provided more than $3 million in assistance, including\nprovisions airlifted in for 50,000 people in the earthquake-prone region and\nassistance with water and sanitation systems in affected areas. A U.N. appeal\nby the Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance sought to raise $73\nmillion. However, as of July 2016, only one-fifth of this amount had been\nreceived from donor countries, including the United States.\n\nThe Correa government increased a value-added tax and implemented a plan to\nfurther cut government expenditures after cutting capital expenditures by 30%.\nDespite President Correa's reluctance to ask for assistance from the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the IMF approved a request for $364 million\nin financial support under its Rapid Financing Instrument in early July 2016\nfor Ecuador. Additional loans from China and the World Bank to help ease the\ngovernment's balance-of-payments needs were considered.\n\nEcuador's access to global financial markets also had been limited by its 2008\ndefault on $3.2 billion in debt to global lenders. Consequently, the Correa\ngovernment turned to nontraditional allies, such as China, for external\nfinance. From 2005 to 2014, Chinese banks provided almost $11 billion of\nfinancing to Ecuador. The Correa government also asked China for an additional\n$7.5 billion in financing in early 2015 as crude oil prices—the nation's\nbiggest export—weakened further. China agreed to the financing request and\nbegan to disburse funding, including nearly $1 billion in May and June 2015.\nEcuador successfully returned to the international capital market in June 2014\nwith a $2 billion bond issue followed by additional smaller bond issues in\n2015. President Moreno later discovered loans made by China over the years\ncurrently require that Ecuador pay China back with almost 500 barrels of crude\noil—or roughly three years of the country's oil production. According to press\nreports, some private sector analysts question whether Ecuador will be able to\nmeet its debt obligations given two strains on the country's public finances:\nthe slump in oil income due to the commodity's low price and the strong U.S.\ndollar, which, as a result of Ecuador's dollarized economy, makes the\ncountry's exports less globally competitive.\n\nEcuador withdrew from efforts to develop a regional free trade agreement (FTA)\nbetween the United States and Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in 2006.\nThe United States subsequently signed bilateral FTAs with Peru and Colombia,\nbut Ecuador showed no interest in pursuing an FTA with the United States.\nFollowing Venezuela's acceptance in 2012 to full membership in the South\nAmerican customs union, Mercosur (Mercado Común del Sur or Common Market of\nthe South), the leftist governments in Bolivia and Ecuador applied to move\nfrom observer status to full membership in the trade bloc originally composed\nof Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. According to some observers, out\nof a concern for Ecuador's struggling non-oil exporters, Correa embraced a\ntrade agreement with the European Union (EU) as part of the EU-Andean\nCommunity Association agreement that went into effect in January 2017.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund approved an agreement with Ecuador in March\n2019. This arrangement would provide support ($10 billion) for the Ecuadorian\ngovernment's economic policies over three years (2018–2021 Prosperity Plan)."
