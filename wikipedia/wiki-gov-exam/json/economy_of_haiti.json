    "text": "Haiti has a free market economy with low labor costs. A republic, it was a\nFrench colony before gaining independence in an uprising by its enslaved\npeople. It faced embargoes and isolation after its independence as well as\npolitical crises punctuated by foreign interventions and devastating natural\ndisasters. Haiti's estimated population in 2018 was 11,439,646. _The\nEconomist_ reported in 2010: \"Long known as the poorest country in the Western\nhemisphere, Haiti has stumbled from one crisis to another since the Duvalier\n(François Duvalier) years.\"\n\nHaiti has an agricultural economy. Over half of the world's vetiver oil (an\nessential oil used in high-end perfumes) comes from Haiti. Bananas, cocoa, and\nmangoes are important export crops. Haiti has also moved to expand to higher-\nend manufacturing, producing Android-based tablets and current sensors and\ntransformers. Its major trading partner is the United States (US), which\nprovides the country with preferential trade access to the US market through\nthe Haiti Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) and\nthe Haiti Economic Lift Program Encouragement Acts (HELP) legislation.\n\nVulnerability to natural disasters, as well as poverty and limited access to\neducation are among Haiti's most serious disadvantages. Two-fifths of all\nHaitians depend on the agriculture sector, mainly small-scale subsistence\nfarming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters,\nexacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. Haiti maintains a trade\ndeficit, which it is working to address by moving into higher-end\nmanufacturing and more value-added products in the agriculture sector.\nRemittances are the primary source of foreign exchange, equaling nearly 20% of\nGDP. Haiti's economy was severely impacted by the 2010 Haiti earthquake which\noccurred on 12 January 2010."

    "text": "Historical GDP per capita development\n\nBefore the people enslaved in Haiti to work its plantations revolted against\nFrench colonization in 1804, Haiti ranked as the world's richest and most\nproductive colony. In the formative years of independence, Haiti suffered from\nisolation on the international stage, as evidenced by the early lack of\ndiplomatic recognition accorded to it by Europe and the United States (which\ndid not recognize it until 1862); this had a negative impact on investment in\nHaiti. Another economic obstacle in Haiti's early independence was its payment\nof 150 million francs to France beginning in 1825; this did much to drain the\ncountry of its capital stock. France forced Haiti to pay for its independence\nand freedom from colonization. According to a 2014 study, the Haitian economy\nstagnated due to a combination of weak state power and adverse international\nrelations. The authors write:\n\n> For the newborn 'Negro republic', it was hard to become recognised as a\n> sovereign nation state, it was difficult to form strategic alliances, to get\n> access to foreign loans, and to safeguard trade interests, and it was\n> overloaded with debt under threat of external violence (the French\n> indemnity). Self-chosen isolation, for instance by prohibiting foreign\n> landownership, further reduced the choice set of successive Haitian\n> administrations. When opportunities for export-led growth opened up in the\n> late 19th century, the odds were stacked against Haiti.\n\nThe United States invaded and occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1994 restoration of constitutional governance, Haitian\nofficials have indicated their commitment to economic reform through the\nimplementation of sound fiscal and monetary policies and the enactment of\nlegislation mandating the modernization of state-owned enterprises. A council\nto guide the modernization program (CMEP) was established and a timetable was\ndrawn up to modernize nine key parastatals. Although the state-owned flour-\nmill and cement plants have been transferred to private owners, progress on\nthe other seven parastatals has stalled. The modernization of Haiti's state-\nenterprises remains a controversial political issue in Haiti.\n\nUnder President René Préval (1996–2001, 2006 – 14 May 2011), the country's\neconomic agenda included trade and tariff liberalization, measures to control\ngovernment expenditure and increase tax revenues, civil-service downsizing,\nfinancial-sector reform, the privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the\nprovision of private sector management contracts, or joint public-private\ninvestment. Structural adjustment agreements with the International Monetary\nFund, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and other international\nfinancial institutions aiming at creating necessary conditions for private\nsector growth, have proved only partly successful.\n\nComparative social and economic indicators show Haiti falling behind other\nlow-income developing countries (particularly in the Western hemisphere) since\nthe 1980s. Haiti's economic stagnation results from earlier[_when?_]\ninappropriate economic policies, political instability, a shortage of good\narable land, environmental deterioration, continued use of traditional\ntechnologies, under-capitalization and lack of public investment in human\nresources, migration of large portions of the skilled population, and a weak\nnational savings rate.\n\nHaiti continues to suffer the consequences of the 1991 coup. The irresponsible\neconomic and financial policies of _de facto_ authorities greatly[_citation\nneeded_] accelerated Haiti's economic decline. Following the coup, the United\nStates adopted mandatory sanctions, and the OAS instituted voluntary sanctions\naimed at restoring constitutional government. International sanctions\nculminated in the May 1994 United Nations embargo of all goods entering Haiti\nexcept humanitarian supplies, such as food and medicine. The assembly sector,\nheavily dependent on U.S. markets for its products, employed nearly 80,000\nworkers in the mid-1980s. During the embargo, employment fell from 33,000\nworkers in 1991 to 400 in October 1995. Private, domestic and foreign\ninvestment has been slow to return to Haiti. Since the return of\nconstitutional rule, assembly sector employment has gradually recovered with\nover 20,000 now employed, but further growth has been stalled by investor\nconcerns over safety and supply reliability.\n\nRemittances from abroad have consistently constituted a significant source of\nfinancial support for many Haitian households.\n\nThe Haitian Ministry of Economy and Finance designed the Haiti economic\nreforms of 1996 to rebuild the economy of Haiti after significant downturns\nsuffered in the previous years. The primary reforms centered around the\nEmergency Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) and were followed by budget reforms.\n\nHaiti's real GDP growth turned negative in FY 2001 after six years of growth.\nReal GDP fell by 1.1% in FY 2001 and 0.9% in FY 2002. Macroeconomic stability\nwas adversely affected by political uncertainty, the collapse of informal\nbanking cooperatives, high budget deficits, low investment, and reduced\ninternational capital flows, including suspension of IFI lending as Haiti fell\ninto arrears with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and World Bank.\n\nHaiti's economy stabilized in 2003. Although FY 2003 began with the rapid\ndecline of the gourde due to rumors that U.S. dollar deposit accounts would be\nnationalized and due to the withdrawal of fuel subsidies, the government\nsuccessfully stabilized the gourde as it took the politically difficult\ndecisions to float fuel prices freely according to world market prices and to\nraise interest rates. Government agreement with the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) on a staff monitored program (SMP), followed by its payment of its\n$32 million arrears to the IDB in July, paved the way for renewed IDB lending.\nThe IDB disbursed $35 million of a $50 million policy-based loan in July and\nbegan disbursing four previously approved project loans totaling $146 million.\nThe IDB, IMF, and World Bank also discussed new lending with the government.\nMuch of this would be contingent on government adherence to fiscal and\nmonetary targets and policy reforms, such as those begun under the SMP, and\nHaiti's payment of its World Bank arrears ($30 million at 9/30/03).\n\nThe IMF estimated that real GDP was flat in FY 2003 and projected 1% real GDP\ngrowth for FY 2004. However, GDP per capita – amounting to $425 in FY 2002 –\nwill continue to decline[_citation needed_] as population growth is estimated\nat 1.3% p.a. While implementation of governance reforms and peaceful\nresolution of the political stalemate are key to long-term growth,[_citation\nneeded_] external support remains critical in avoiding economic collapse. The\nmajor element is foreign remittances, reported as $931 million in 2002,\nprimarily from the U.S. Foreign assistance, meanwhile, was $130 million in FY\n2002. Overall foreign assistance levels have declined since FY 1995, the year\nelected government was restored to power under a United Nations mandate, when\nthe international community provided over $600 million in aid.\n\nA legal minimum wage of 36 gourdes a day (about U.S. $1.80) was set in 1995,\nand applies to most workers in the formal sector. It was later raised to 70\ngourdes per day. This minimum is 200 gourdes a day (about U.S. $4.80). One\nU.S. dollar is equal to 39.175 gourdes.\n\nHaiti's economy suffered a severe setback in January 2010 when a 7.0 magnitude\nearthquake destroyed much of its capital city, Port-au-Prince, and neighboring\nareas. Already the poorest country in the Americas with 80% of the population\nliving under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty, the earthquake\ninflicted $7.8 billion in damage and caused the country's GDP to contract 5.4%\nin 2010. Following the earthquake, Haiti received $4.59 billion in\ninternational pledges for reconstruction, which has proceeded slowly.\n\nChart showing the history of Haiti's GDP.\n\nUS economic engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through\nPartnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has boosted\napparel exports and investment by providing duty-free access to the US.\nCongress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation until 2020 under the HELP\nAct; the apparel sector accounts for about 90% of Haitian exports and nearly\none-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign exchange,\nequaling nearly 20% of GDP and more than twice the earnings from exports.\nHaiti suffers from a lack of investment, partly because of limited\ninfrastructure and a lack of security. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the\nWorld Bank, paving the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt\nforgiveness for over $1 billion through the Highly-Indebted Poor Country\ninitiative in mid-2009. The remainder of its outstanding external debt was\ncancelled by donor countries following the 2010 earthquake but has since risen\nto over $600 million. The government relies on formal international economic\nassistance for fiscal sustainability, with over half of its annual budget\ncoming from outside sources. The Michel Martelly administration in 2011\nlaunched a campaign aimed at drawing foreign investment into Haiti as a means\nfor sustainable development."

    "text": "In 2005 Haiti's total external debt reached an estimated US$1.3 billion, which\ncorresponds to debt per capita of US$169, in contrast to the debt per capita\nof the United States which is US$102,000. Following the democratic election of\nAristide in December 1990, many international creditors responded by\ncancelling significant amounts of Haiti's debt, bringing the total down to\nUS$777 million in 1991. However, new borrowing during the 1990s swelled the\ndebt to more than US$1 billion.\n\nAt peak, Haiti's total external debt was estimated at 1.8 billion dollars,\nincluding half a billion dollars to the Inter-American Development Bank,\nHaiti's largest creditor. In September 2009, Haiti met the conditions set out\nby the IMF and World Bank's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program,\nqualifying it for cancellation of some of its external debt. This amounted to\na cancellation of $1.2 billion. Despite this as of 2010 calls for cancellation\nof its remaining $1 billion debts came strongly from civil society groups such\nas the Jubilee Debt Campaign in reaction to the effects of the earthquake that\nhit the country."

Agriculture, together with forestry\nand fishing, accounts for about one-quarter (28% in 2004) of Haiti's annual\ngross domestic product and employs about two-thirds (66% in 2004) of the labor\nforce. However, expansion has been difficult because mountains cover much of\nthe countryside and limit the land available for cultivation. Of the total\narable land of 550,000 hectares, 125,000 hectares are suited for irrigation,\nand of those only 75,000 hectares actually have been improved with irrigation.\nHaiti's dominant cash crops include coffee, mangoes, and cocoa. Haiti has\ndecreased its production of sugarcane, traditionally an important cash crop,\nbecause of declining prices and fierce international competition. Because\nHaiti's forests have thinned dramatically, timber exports have declined.\nRoundwood removals annually total about 1,000 kilograms. Haiti also has a\nsmall fishing industry. Annual catches in recent years have totaled about\n5,000 tons."

Gold was mined by the Spanish in early\ncolonial times. Bauxite was mined for a number of years in recent times at a\nsite near Miragoâne on the Southern peninsula. Operating from 1960 to 1972\nInternational Halliwell Mines, Ltd. (\"Halliwell\"), a Canadian corporation,\nthrough its wholly owned Haitian subsidiary, La Societe d'Exploitation et de\nDeveloppement Economique et Natural d'Haiti (\"Sedren\") mined copper near\nGonaïves.\n\n0.5 million tons of ore were exported. The copper ore was valued at about\n$83.5 million. The government of Haiti received about $3 million. As of 2012\nthere was promise of gold and copper mining in northern Haiti."

Estimates for the value of the gold which might be extracted\nthrough open-pit mining are as high as US$20 billion. Eurasian Minerals and\nNewmont Mining Corporation are two of the firms involved. According to Alex\nDupuy, Chair of African American Studies and John E. Andrus Professor of\nSociology at Wesleyan University the ability of Haiti to adequately manage the\nmining operations or to obtain and use funds obtained from the operations for\nthe benefit of its people is untested and seriously questioned. Lakwèv, where\nearth dug from hand-made tunnels is washed for specks of free gold by local\nresidents, is one of the locations. In the same mineralized zone in the\nDominican Republic Barrick Gold and Goldcorp are planning on reopening the\nPueblo Viejo mine."

Private home building and construction\nappear to be one subsector with positive prospects for growth.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nIn 2004 industry accounted for about 20 percent of the gross domestic product\n(GDP), and less than 10 percent of the labor force worked in industrial\nproduction. As a portion of the GDP, the manufacturing sector has contracted\nsince the 1980s. The United Nations embargo of 1994 put out of work most of\nthe 80,000 workers in the assembly sector. Additionally, the years of military\nrule following the presidential coup in 1991 resulted in the closure of most\nof Haiti's offshore assembly plants in the free zones surrounding Port-au-\nPrince. When President Aristide returned to Haiti, some improvements did occur\nin the manufacturing sector.[_citation needed_]\n\nHaiti's cheaper labor brought some textile and garment assembly work back to\nthe island in the late 1990s. Although these gains were undercut by\ninternational competition, the apparel sector in 2008 made up two-thirds of\nHaiti's annual 490 million US dollars exports. USA economic engagement under\nthe HOPE Act, from December 2006, increased apparel exports and investment by\nproviding tariff-free access to the USA. HOPE II, in October 2008, further\nimproved the situation by extending preferences to 2018."
