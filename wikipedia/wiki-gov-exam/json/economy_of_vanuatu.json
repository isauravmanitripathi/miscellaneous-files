    "text": "In addition, the Vanuatu government has maintained the country's pre-\nindependence status as a tax haven and international financial center. About\n2,000 registered institutions offer a wide range of offshore banking,\ninvestment, legal, accounting, and insurance and trust company services. On\nthe Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index, Vanuatu received a\n\"secrecy score\" of 88/100, though its marginal market share placed it near the\nbottom of the weighted list. Vanuatu was one of three Pacific island nations\n(along with Nauru and Palau) which four major international banks placed a\nU.S. dollar transaction ban on in December 1999. Vanuatu sells citizenship for\nabout $150,000, and its passports allow visa-free travel throughout Europe.\nWith demand from the Chinese market booming, passport sales may now account\nfor more than 30% of the country's revenue. Vanuatu maintains an international\nshipping register in New York City.[_citation needed_]"

Government consumption accounted for about 27% of GDP.\n\nVanuatu has commodities, mostly agricultural, produced for export. In 2000,\nimports exceeded exports by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1. This was offset by high\nservices income from tourism, which kept the current account balance fairly\neven. After a downturn in 2001 and 2002 due to a decrease in tourism\nfunding,[_clarification needed_] the economy was expected to grow by 3.9%,\nincreasing to 4.3% in 2007.[_citation needed_]"
