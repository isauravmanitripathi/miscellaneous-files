    "text": "South Sudan became the world's newest country and Africa's 55th nation on 9\nJuly 2011. The South Sudanese Civil War, which started in December 2013,\nundermined economic development achieved since independence, making\nhumanitarian work difficult to conduct within the country. As such, South\nSudan is facing economic stagnation and instability in its first 10 years\nafter independence. Moreover, poverty is widespread throughout the country as\na result of inter-communal conflict, displacement, and the negative effects of\nthe war in Sudan on the country's oil industry.\n\nThe economy of South Sudan is $3.681 billion by gross domestic product as of\n2019, being one of the most oil dependent economies in the world, with 98% of\ngovernment's annual operating budget and 80% of its gross domestic product\n(GDP) derived from oil, despite being endowed with adequate natural resources.\nIt has a very fertile agricultural land and vast quantities of livestock. The\nlivestock include over 60 million cattle, sheep and goats. Instability,\nunsatisfactory governance, and corruption continue to hinder development in\nSouth Sudan.\n\nSouth Sudan is mostly underdeveloped, and one of the least developed\ncountries; most cities in the country have no electricity or running water,\nand overall infrastructure is lacking, with only 10,000 km (6,200 mi) of paved\nroads."

    "text": "South Sudan exports timber to the international market. Some of the states\nwith the best known teak and natural trees for timber are Western Equatoria\nand Central Equatoria and some parts of Eastern Equatoria like magwi. There\nare teak plantations located at Kegulu; the other, oldest planted forest\nreserves are Kawale, Lijo, Loka West, and Nuni. Western Equatoria timber\nresources include mvuba trees at Zamoi.\n\nOne of the major natural features of South Sudan is the River Nile whose many\ntributaries have sources in the country. The region also contains many natural\nresources such as petroleum, iron ore, copper, chromium ore, zinc, tungsten,\nmica, silver, gold in Kapoeta area of Eastern Equatoria, and hydropower. The\ncountry's economy, as in many other developing countries, is heavily dependent\non agriculture. Some of the agricultural produce include cotton, groundnuts\n(peanuts), sorghum, millet, wheat, gum arabic, sugarcane, cassava (tapioca),\nmangos, papaya, maize, simsim, bananas, sweet potatoes, and sesame. Solar\npower could become important with a solar photovoltaic project on 250,000 m2\nof land near Juba expected to be operational by late 2020. The project\nconsists of a 20 MWP photovoltaic park, a 35 megawatt-hour battery storage\nsystem and an in-house training center."

    "text": "Oil and gas concessions in Sudan – 2004.\n\nPrior to independence, South Sudan produced 85% of Sudanese oil output. The\noil revenues according to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), were to be\nsplit equally for the duration of the agreement period. Since South Sudan\nrelies on pipelines, refineries, and port facilities in Red Sea state in North\nSudan, the agreement stated that the government in Khartoum would receive 50%\nshare of all oil revenues. Oil revenues constitute more than 98% of the\ngovernment of South Sudan's budget according to the southern government's\nMinistry of Finance and Economic Planning, and this has amounted to more than\n$8 billion in revenue since the signing of the peace agreement.\n\nIn recent years, a significant amount of foreign-based oil drilling has begun\nin South Sudan, raising the land's geopolitical profile. Oil and other mineral\nresources can be found throughout South Sudan, but the area around Bentiu is\ncommonly known as being especially rich in oil, while Jonglei, Warrap, and\nLakes have potential reserves. During the autonomy years from 2005 to 2011,\nKhartoum partitioned much of Sudan into blocks, with about 85% of the oil\ncoming from the South. Blocks 1, 2, and 4 are controlled by the largest\noverseas consortium, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC).\nGNPOC is composed of the following players: China National Petroleum\nCorporation (CNPC, People's Republic of China), with a 40% stake; Petronas\n(Malaysia), with 30%; Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (India), with 25%; and\nSudapet of the central Sudan government with 5%.\n\nDue to Sudan's presence on the United States' list of state sponsors of\nterrorism and Khartoum's insistence upon receiving a share of the profit from\nany oil deal South Sudan conducts internationally, US oil companies cannot do\nbusiness with landlocked South Sudan. As such, US companies have virtually no\npresence in the South Sudanese oil sector.\n\nThe other producing blocks in the South are blocks 3 and 7 in eastern Upper\nNile state. These blocks are controlled by Petrodar which is 41% owned by\nCNPC, 40% by Petronas, 8% by Sudapet, 6% by Sinopec Corp and 5% by Al Thani.\n\nAnother major block in the South, formerly called Block B by the North\nSudanese government, is claimed by several players. Total of France was\nawarded the concession for the 90,000 square kilometre block in the 1980s but\nhas since done limited work invoking \"force majeure\". Various elements of the\nSPLM handed out the block or parts thereof to other parties of South Sudan.\nSeveral of these pre-Naivasha deals were rejected when the SPLM/A leader Dr.\nJohn Garang de Mabior lost power.\n\nThe wealth-sharing section of the CPA states that all agreements signed prior\nto the CPA would hold; they would not be subject to review by the National\nPetroleum Commission (NPC), a commission set up by the CPA and composed of\nboth Khartoum and Southerners and co-chaired by both President al-Bashir of\nKhartoum and President Kiir of South Sudan. However, the CPA does not specify\nwho could sign those pre-CPA agreements. According to some reports, the\nPeople's Republic of China has offered to extend a line of credit to South\nSudan for several years while an alternative pipeline to the Kenyan coast is\nlaid and an export deal is worked out with the Kenyan government, but this\nscenario is regarded as less likely than continued South Sudanese dependence\non Sudanese infrastructure. If such a deal were struck, though, and South\nSudan began exporting oil from Kenyan ports, the US would become a potential\ntrade partner and South Sudanese oil importer. In the meantime, the South\nSudanese government intends to lobby the US to ease restrictions on American\ncompanies doing business with Sudan."

    "text": "| This section **may be in need of reorganization to comply with\nWikipedia'slayout guidelines**. Please help by editing the article to make\nimprovements to the overall structure. _( January 2014)__(Learn how and when\nto remove this message)_\n---|---\nSouth Sudan has the second highest proportion of women working in agriculture,\nforestry and fishing in the world.\n\nSouth Sudan is rich in agricultural land and has one of the largest\npopulations of pastoralists in the world. However, since 1999, when Sudan\nfirst started exporting oil, agricultural production in the country had\ndeclined. According to the World Bank, the average annual growth rate of the\nagricultural sector between 2000 and 2008 was only 3.6 percent, which is\nconsiderably lower than the 10.8 percent growth rate of the previous decade.\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Agency (FAO) carried out an extensive satellite\nland cover survey that showed just 4.5 percent of the available land was under\ncultivation when South Sudan became independent.\n\nSouth Sudan relies on food imports from neighboring countries, such as Uganda,\nKenya and Sudan. These come at a high transportation cost which, coupled with\ninflation, has caused food prices to rise dramatically in South Sudan. The\ndeclining agricultural production and the reliance on expensive foreign food\nsupplies have contributed to a severe food shortage in South Sudan. Around 2.7\nmillion South Sudanese will need food aid in 2012 according to the United\nNations' food programme.\n\nThe government has begun to address the issue of agriculture and food\nsecurity. According to Elizabeth Manoa Majok, undersecretary in the Ministry\nof Commerce, Industry and Investment, the government of South Sudan has made\nfood production a top priority. The Ministry of Agriculture in South Sudan has\nannounced its goal of boosting food production in South Sudan to two million\nmetric tons per year by 2013. South Sudan hopes to attract agricultural\ninvestors from Gulf Arab states, Israel, China, the Netherlands and fellow\nAfrican countries in order to increase production of basic food items such as\nsugar, rice, cereals and oilseeds, livestock as well as cotton.\n\nIn June 2011, the vice-president of South Sudan, Riek Machar Teny, announced a\nplan to mobilize $500 billion of foreign investment in the first five years of\nindependence. Much of this investment would be focused in the agricultural\nsector, where the government hopes to diversify the economy and provide jobs\nto the large numbers of unemployed. The FAO has also drawn up a $50 million\nInterim Assistance Plan (IAP) for the agricultural sector that will build\ncapacity in ministerial and state agricultural extension offices. This\nincludes the establishment of a seed production sector and an urban and peri-\nurban agriculture component.\n\nSmallholder farming accounts for 80 percent of the country's cereal\nproduction. Unfortunately, these farmers face a number of constraints, due to\nhigh transport costs, unavailability of agricultural inputs, and\nunderdeveloped agricultural extension services. Instead of investing resources\ninto developing the kind of agricultural extension services that could help\nsmallholder production, however, the government has chosen to focus on large-\nscale, private sector-led industrial agricultural schemes as a way to boost\nfood production.\n\nDonor countries promote the idea that industrial farming is the key to\nimproved food security in South Sudan. The United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID), for example, is working with Citibank, the\nIFC, the Corporate Council on Africa, and others to help the country market\nits resources and attract private capital in key sectors, including\nagriculture.\n\nThis investment is intended to stimulate rural development and generate\nemployment opportunities, increase food productivity, provide government\ninstitutions with new and sustainable sources of revenue, and help to\ndiversify the economy. There is some concern, however, that a small\ntransnational elite will benefit at the expense of the rural poor if the\ncountry's arable land is used to grow food for foreign populations, while\nsimultaneously pushing communities onto increasingly marginal lands. This\ncould create the potential for more food insecurity, instability, social\nunrest and conflict.\n\nNina Pedersen, manager of Norwegian People's Aid (NPA)'s Civil Society\nDevelopment Project is concerned that in the rush to attract foreign\ninvestment for South Sudan not enough attention was paid as to whether the\npeople negotiating the terms really knew the value of the land they were\nselling. According to the NPA, prior to South Sudan's declaration of\nIndependence, beginning in 2007, private interests sought or secured 5.15\nmillion hectares of land in the agriculture, biofuels, forestry, carbon\ncredit, and ecotourism sectors—equivalent to more than eight percent of South\nSudan's total land area.\n\nOne of the largest firms involved is the Egyptian private equity firm Citadel\nCapital, which has leased 259,500 acres for farming. This plantation has\nprovided little local employment, being mostly run by Zimbabweans. A Ugandan\nconglomerate called the Madhvani Group has also entered into a preliminary\nagreement with the government of South Soudan to revitalize a government-owned\nsugar plantation and processing facility in Mangala Payam. This plantation\nwould cover 10,000 ha of prime riverfront property along the Nile, about 70\nkilometers north of Juba. According to the paramount chief in Mangala, the\ncommunity has not been involved in any of the investment negotiations.\n\nConcerns about foreign exploitation has led organizations such as OI and NPA\nto urge a moratorium on new land deals until a better framework is\nestablished.\n\nBanana plantation\n\nFor its part, the South Sudan's Land Commission, a task force headed by Robert\nLado in charge of advising the government and drawing up the new policy, is\npushing for land administrations at county and sub-county level that are run\nby community members, including women and tribal elders."

Access to clean water in South Sudan is a major challenge\nfor many people.\n\nThe nation has some telecommunications service through operators like MTN\nGroup (formerly known as Investcom), but currently lacks the infrastructure to\noffer high speed Internet connections. In September 2022 South Sudan and\nDjibouti signed an agreement to lay fibre optic cable from Djibouti to South\nSudan’s capital, Juba, via Ethiopia. In March 2015, South Sudan's minister for\ntelecommunications and postal services revealed plans for the government to\nlay 1,600 kilometers of fiber-optic cable across the country within two years.\nThe government plans to connect this network with undersea cables via existing\ninfrastructure in Uganda and Tanzania."

    "text": "The presidents of Kenya and Rwanda invited the Autonomous Government of\nSouthern Sudan to apply for membership upon the independence of South Sudan in\n2011, and South Sudan was reportedly an applicant country as of mid-July 2011.\nBy early-October, South Sudan was officially expected to become a member in\nthe future. Analysts suggested that South Sudan's early efforts to integrate\ninfrastructure, including rail links and oil pipelines, with systems in Kenya\nand Uganda indicated intention on the part of Juba to pivot away from\ndependence on Sudan and toward the EAC. Reuters considered South Sudan the\nlikeliest candidate for EAC expansion in the short term, and an article in\nTanzanian daily _The Citizen_ that reported East African Legislative Assembly\nSpeaker Abdirahin Haithar Abdi said South Sudan was \"free to join the EAC\"\nasserted that analysts believe the country will soon become a full member of\nthe regional body.\n\nOn 17 September 2011, the _Daily Nation_ quoted a South Sudanese MP as saying\nthat while his government was eager to join the EAC, it would likely delay its\nmembership over concerns that its economy was not sufficiently developed to\ncompete with EAC member states and could become a \"dumping ground\" for Kenyan,\nTanzanian, and Ugandan exports. This was contradicted by President Salva Kiir,\nwho announced South Sudan had officially embarked on the application process\none month later. The application was initially deferred by the EAC in December\n2012, however incidents with Ugandan boda-boda operators in South Sudan have\ncreated political tension and may delay the process.\n\nIn December 2012, Tanzania officially agreed to South Sudan's bid to join the\nEAC, clearing the way for the world's newest state to become the regional\nbloc's sixth member. In May 2013 the EAC set aside $82,000 for the admission\nof South Sudan into the bloc even though admission may not happen until 2016.\nThe process, to start after the EAC Council of Ministers meeting in August\n2013, was projected to take at least four years. At the 14th Ordinary Summit\nheld in Nairobi in 2012, EAC heads of state approved the verification report\nthat was presented by the Council of Ministers, then directed it to start the\nnegotiation process with South Sudan.\n\nA team was formed to assess South Sudan's bid; however, in April 2014, the\nnation requested a delay in the admissions process, presumably due to South\nSudanese Civil War.\n\nSouth Sudan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, claimed\npublicly in October 2015 that, following evaluations and meetings of a special\ntechnical committee in May, June, August, September and October, the committee\nhas recommended that South Sudan be allowed to join the East African\nCommunity. Those recommendations, however, had not been officially released to\nthe public. It was reported that South Sudan could be admitted as early as\nNovember 2015 when the heads of East African States had their summit meeting.\n\nSouth Sudan was eventually approved for membership in East African Community\nin March 2016, and formally acceded with the signature of the treaty in April\n2016."
