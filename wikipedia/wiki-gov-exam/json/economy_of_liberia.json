    "text": "The **economy of Liberia** is extremely underdeveloped, with only $3.222\nbillion by gross domestic product as of 2019, largely due to the First\n(1989–1996) and Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003). Liberia itself is one\nof the poorest and least developed countries in the world, according to the\nUnited Nations.\n\nUntil 1979, Liberia's economy was among the more developed and fastest-growing\nin Sub-Saharan Africa, but after the 1980 coup d'état, it declined, and the\ncivil war destroyed much of Liberia's economy and infrastructure, especially\nthe infrastructure in and around the nation's capital, Monrovia. The war also\ncaused a brain drain and the loss of capital, as the civil war involved\noverthrowing the Americo-Liberian minority that ruled the country. Some have\nreturned since 1997, but many have not.\n\nLiberia is richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a\nclimate favorable to agriculture, but poor in human capital, infrastructure,\nand stability. Liberia has a fairly typical profile for Sub-Saharan African\neconomies. The majority of the population is reliant on subsistence\nagriculture, while exports are dominated by raw commodities such as rubber and\niron ore. Local manufacturing, such as it exists, is mainly foreign-owned.\n\nThe democratically elected government, installed in August 1997, inherited\nmassive international debts and currently relies on revenues from its maritime\nregistry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange earnings. The restoration\nof the infrastructure and the raising of incomes in this ravaged economy\ndepend on the implementation of sound macro- and microeconomic policies of the\nnew government, including the encouragement of foreign investment.[_according\nto whom?_]"

    "section_name": "Economic history",
    "text": "Much of independent Liberia's economic history is subject to limited archival\ndocumentation, making it hard for economic historians to make comprehensive\nassessments about the nature of Liberia's economy over time. The Liberian\ngovernment only began producing GDP per capita data in 1964.\n\nA 2022 study by LSE economic historian Leigh A. Gardner assessed that Liberian\nGDP per capita was $430 in 1845, which was just above subsistence and\napproximately half of Japan's GDP per capita at the time. It rose to\napproximately $500 by the time of independence, but the economy subsequently\nstagnated until the 1930s when a period of rapid economic growth began.\nWhereas Liberia had been poorer than Ghana during the 19th and early 20th\ncenturies, it caught up with Ghana in 1950 and subsequently diverged\nconsiderably, becoming almost twice as wealthy as Ghana by 1970. Throughout\nthe 1970s, the Liberian economy stagnated.\n\nIn 1926, the Liberian government gave the Firestone Tire company the right to\nlease up to 1 million acres of land for 99 years at a cost of 6 cents per\nacre. Firestone developed an inordinate sway over the Liberian government,\neffectively acquiring control over its finances in the subsequent period. The\ncompany was an important source of foreign investment into Liberia during this\nperiod. Firestone then set about establishing rubber tree plantations of the\nnon-native South American rubber tree, _Hevea brasiliensis_ in the country. By\nthe 1950s, the company was Liberia's largest private employer and also its\nlargest exporter. Vincent Browne wrote in 1955 that rubber accounted for more\nthan $45,000,000 of Liberia's approximately $55,000,000 worth of exports.\nLiberia became one of the largest rubber exporters in the world in the post-\nWorld War II period. Today, Firestone's rubber plantation in Liberia is the\nworld's largest contiguous rubber plantation, operated by the Firestone (now\nBridgestone) subsidiary, the Firestone Natural Rubber Company.\n\nIn the 1940s, Liberia become one of the largest recipients of American aid. US\naid to Liberia began with the Lend-Lease program of 1942. The aid per capita\nreceived by Liberia was comparable to that obtained by countries such as Korea\nand Marshall Aid recipients like the United Kingdom. Economic historian George\nDalton estimated in 1965 that Liberia received more aid per capita from the\nUnited States than any other African country.\n\nIn the post-WWII period, Liberia tried to become a destination for offshore\nservices, as the country loosened laws related to ship registration,\ncorporation, and taxes. The Liberian shipping registry was highly successful\nas Liberia had by the 1960s become the largest ship registry in the world in\nterms of tonnage.\n\nThe Liberian economy had relied heavily on the mining of iron ore prior to the\ncivil war. Liberia was a major exporter of iron ore on the world market. By\nthe 1970s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export\nearnings. Since the coup d'état of 1980, the country's economic growth rate\nhas slowed down because of a decline in the demand for iron ore on the world\nmarket and political upheavals in Liberia.\n\nUpon the end of the war in 2003, GDP growth began to accelerate again,\nreaching a peak of 9.4% in 2007. In 2009, during the Great Recession GDP\ngrowth slowed to 4.6%, though a strengthening agricultural sector led by\nrubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected\n7.3% in 2011, making the economy one of the 20 fastest growing in the world.\n\nIn March 2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the first hotel constructed\nin Liberia in 20 years. The 13-acre (53,000 m2) luxury resort was built in the\nPaynesville section of Monrovia.\n\nLiberia's external debt was estimated in 2006 at approximately $4.5 billion,\n800% of GDP. As a result of bilateral, multilateral and commercial debt relief\nfrom 2007 to 2010, the country's external debt fell to $222.9 million by 2011."

There also are limited\nnumbers of Chinese people engaged in agriculture. The largest timber\nconcession, Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), is Indonesian owned. There also\nare significant numbers of West Africais engaged in cross-border trade. Legal\nmonopolies are possible; for example, Cemenco holds a monopoly on cement\nproduction."

In recent years (2005 - 2012), foreign investment from ArcelorMittal\nSteel, BHP Biliton, and China Union is aiding the revitalization of the iron-\nore mining sector.\n\nLiberia has begun exploration for offshore oil; unproven oil reserves may be\nin excess of one billion barrels. The government divided its offshore waters\ninto 17 blocks and began auctioning off exploration licenses for the blocks in\n2004, with further auctions in 2007 and 2009. An additional 13 ultra-deep\noffshore blocks were demarcated in 2011 and planned for auction. Among the\ncompanies to have won licenses are Repsol YPF, Chevron Corporation, and\nWoodside Petroleum."

    "text": "Liberia maintains an open maritime registry, meaning that owners of ships can\nregister their vessels as Liberian with relatively few restrictions. This has\nmeant that Liberian ship registration is usually understood as the employment\nof a flag of convenience. Liberia has the second-largest maritime registry in\nthe world behind Panama, with 4,300 vessels registered under its flag\naccounting for 12% of ships worldwide. This includes 35% of the world's tanker\nfleet. Liberia earned more than $18 million from its maritime program in 2000."

But because of the Liberian Government's\nperceived disregard for human rights, foreign assistance to Liberia has\ndeclined drastically.\n\nThe Republic of China (Taiwan) and Libya are currently the largest donors of\ndirect financial aid to the Liberian Government. Significant amounts of aid\ncontinue to come in from Western countries through international aid agencies\nand non-governmental organizations, avoiding direct aid to the government."

Also, the radio stations in\nLiberia are abundant to the extent that there are over 70 radio stations in\nthe entire country (Liberia). As for Montserrado County, there exist about 30\nradio stations.\n\nEven as it struggles with economic and political constraints, Liberia's media\nenvironment is expanding. The number of registered newspapers and radio\nstations (many of them community stations) is on the rise despite limited\nmarket potential. And politically critical content and investigative pieces do\nget published or broadcast."
