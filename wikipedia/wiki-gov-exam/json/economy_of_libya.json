Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( March 2015)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Libya** depends primarily on revenues from the petroleum\nsector, which represents over 95% of export earnings and 60% of GDP. These oil\nrevenues and a small population have given Libya one of the highest nominal\nper capita GDP in Africa.\n\nAfter 2000, Libya recorded favorable growth rates with an estimated 10.6%\ngrowth of GDP in 2010. This development was interrupted by the Libyan Civil\nWar, which resulted in contraction of the economy by 62.1% in 2011. After the\nwar, the economy rebounded by 104.5% in 2012. It crashed again following the\nSecond Libyan Civil War. As of 2024, Libya's per capita PPP GDP stands at only\n65% of its pre-war level in 2010."

    "text": "Development of oil production in Libya\n\nLibya is an OPEC member and holds the largest proven oil reserves in Africa\n(followed by Nigeria and Algeria), 41.5 Gbbl (6.60×109 m3) as of January 2007,\nup from 39.1 Gbbl (6.22×109 m3) in 2006. About 80% of Libya's proven oil\nreserves are located in the Sirte Basin, which is responsible for 90% of the\ncountry's oil output. The state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) dominates\nLibya's oil industry, along with smaller subsidiaries, which combined account\nfor around 50% of the country's oil output. Among NOC's subsidiaries, the\nlargest oil producer is the Waha Oil Company (WOC), followed by the Agoco,\nZueitina Oil Company (ZOC), and Sirte Oil Company (SOC). Oil resources, which\naccount for approximately 95% of export earnings, 75% of government receipts,\nand over 50% of GDP. Oil revenues constitute the principal foreign exchange\nsource. Reflecting the heritage of the command economy, three-quarters of\nemployment is in the public sector, and private investment remains small at\naround 2% of GDP.\n\nA map of world oil reserves according to U.S. EIA, 2017\n\nFalling world oil prices in the early 1980s and economic sanctions caused a\nserious decline in economic activity, eventually leading to a slow private\nsector rehabilitation. At 2.6% per year on average, real GDP growth was modest\nand volatile during the 1990s. Libya's GDP grew in 2001 due to high oil\nprices, the end of a long cyclical drought, and increased foreign direct\ninvestment following the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999. Real GDP growth\nhas been boosted by high oil revenues, reaching 4.6% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.\nDespite efforts to diversify the economy and encourage private sector\nparticipation, extensive controls of prices, credit, trade, and foreign\nexchange constrain growth.\n\nAlthough UN sanctions were suspended in 1999, foreign investment in the Libyan\ngas and oil sectors were severely curtailed due to the U.S. Iran and Libya\nSanctions Act (ILSA), which capped the amount foreign companies can invest in\nLibya yearly at $20 million (lowered from $40 million in 2001). As of May\n2006, the U.S. has removed Libya from its list of states that sponsor\nterrorism and has normalised ties and removed sanctions. This clears the road\nfor U.S. oil companies to exploit Libyan oil and is expected to have a\npositive impact on the Libyan economy. [1]\n\nThe NOC hopes to raise oil production from 1.80 million bpd in 2006 to 2\nmillion bpd by 2008. FDI into the oil sector is likely, which is attractive\ndue to its low cost of oil recovery, high oil quality, and proximity to\nEuropean markets. Most Libyan oil is sold on a term basis, including to the\ncountry's Oilinvest marketing network in Europe; to companies like Agip, OMV,\nRepsol YPF, Tupras, CEPSA, and Total; and small volumes to Asian and South\nAfrican companies.\n\nStatistic | Amount\n---|---\nProven Oil Reserves (2007E) | 41.5 Gbbl (6.60×10~~^~~ 9 m3)\nOil Production (2006E) | 1.8 million barrels per day (290×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d) (95% crude)\nOil Consumption (2006E) | 284,000 barrels per day (45,200 m3/d)\nNet Oil Exports (2006E) | 1.5 million barrels per day (240×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d)\nCrude Oil Distillation Capacity (2006E) | 378 kbbl/d (60.1×10~~^~~ 3 m3/d)\nProven Natural Gas Reserves (2007E) | 52.7×10~~^~~ 12 cu ft (1.49×1012 m3)\nNatural Gas Production (2006E) | 3,999×10~~^~~ 9 cu ft (1.132×1011 m3)\nNatural Gas consumption (2005E) | 206×10~~^~~ 9 cu ft (5.8×109 m3)\n\nNotes:\n1\\.

Industry experts believe the discovery to be\none of the biggest made in Libya for several years. Repsol YPF is joined by a\nconsortium of partners including OMV, Total and Norsk Hydro. Also located in\nMurzuq Basin is Eni's Elephant field. In October 1997, a consortium led by\nBritish company Lasmo, along with Eni and a group of five South Korean\ncompanies, announced that it had discovered large recoverable crude reserves\nabout 800 kilometres (500 mi) south of Tripoli. Lasmo estimated field\nproduction would cost around $1 per barrel. Elephant began production in\nFebruary 2004.\n\nWOC's Waha fields currently produce around 350,000 bbl/d (56,000 m3/d). In\n2005, ConocoPhillips and co-venturers reached an agreement with NOC to return\nto its operations in Libya and extend the Waha concession 25 years.\nConocoPhillips operates the Waha fields with a 16.33% share in the project.\nNOC has the largest share of the Waha concession, and additional partners\ninclude Marathon and Amerada Hess."

Climatic conditions and poor soils severely\nlimit farm output, and domestic food production meets only about 25% of\ndemand. Domestic conditions limit output, while higher incomes and a growing\npopulation have caused food consumption to rise.

Although no reliable\nestimates are available, unemployment is reportedly acute: over 50% of the\npopulation under the age of 20. Moreover, despite the bias of labor market\nregulations favoring Libyan workers, the mismatch of the educational system\nwith market demand has produced a large pool of expatriate workers, with\ntypically better-suited education and higher productivity. However, because of\nshortages for manual labor, Libya has also attracted important numbers of less\nskilled immigrants. Expatriate workers represent an estimated fifth of the\nlabor force.\n\nAlthough significant, the proportion of expatriate workers is still below oil\nproducing countries in the Persian Gulf. Foreign workers mainly come from the\nMaghreb, Egypt, Turkey, India, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,\nPoland, Chad, Sudan, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. They tend to earn relatively\nhigh wages, taking either skilled or hard manual jobs. Census data for 2000\nshow the share of expatriates earning over LD 300 (US$230) per month was 20%,\ncompared to 12% for Libyan nationals. A campaign encouraging conversion of\nqualified civil servants to entrepreneurs, in the face of public sector over\nemployment and declining productivity, does not seem to be producing the\ndesired results thus far."
