    "text": "| This article was **imported from the CIA's _World Factbook_**. Please help\nrewrite this article.  \n---|---  \nThe St. Kitts 'Sugar Train' in 1912 used to transport sugarcane\n\nThe **economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis** has traditionally depended on the\ngrowing and processing of sugar cane; decreasing world prices have hurt the\nindustry in recent years. Tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore\nbanking activity have assumed larger roles in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Most food\nis imported. The government has undertaken a program designed to revitalize\nthe faltering sugar sector. It is also working to improve revenue collection\nin order to better fund social programs. In 1997, some leaders in Nevis were\nurging separation from Saint Kitts on the basis that Nevis was paying far more\nin taxes than it was receiving in government services, but the vote on\nsecession failed in August 1998. In late September 1998, Hurricane Georges\ncaused approximately $445 million in damages and limited GDP growth for the\nyear.\n\nThe economy of St. Kitts and Nevis experienced strong growth for most of the\n1990s but hurricanes in 1998 and 1999 contributed to a sharp slowdown. Real\neconomic growth was 0.75% in 2002 after a decline of 4.3% in 2001. The economy\nexperienced a mixed performance during 2002, with some sectors experiencing\npositive growth while others experienced varying levels of decline. The\nconstruction sector recorded a 4.51% decline, manufacturing and hotels and\nrestaurants also recorded significant declines of 4.01 and 9.89% respectively,\nand sugar production fell by 5.1%. Significant new investment in tourism,\nincluding a 648-room Marriott hotel and convention center that opened in\nDecember 2002, as well as continued government efforts to diversify the\neconomy, are expected to improve economic performance. Consumer prices have\nrisen marginally over the past few years. The inflation rate was 3–4% for most\nof the 1990s.\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU)\nThe Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) issues a common currency (the East\nCaribbean dollar) for all members of the ECCU. The ECCB also manages monetary\npolicy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in its\nmember countries. There is an extensive parallel economy denominated in US$,\nwhich is the de facto currency for many business transactions.\n\nSt. Kitts is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications (ECTEL)\nauthority, which is developing the regulations to liberalize the\ntelecommunications sector in the region by 2004.",

    "text": "According to the CIA World Factbook the main industry is tourism. Tourists,\nmainly Americans, come to the island via cruise ships (via Port Zante in\nBasseterre), air travel (via Robert L Bradshaw International Airport), and the\nprivate airport and private dock (for private yachts).\n\nThe tourism industry is unique in that it relies on both long term and short\nterm visitors. Short term visitors are generally Americans, Canadians, and\nother CARICOM countries who come via cruise ship for the day or via Robert L\nBradshaw airport for short term stay. Long term visitors are mostly Americans\nand Canadians that are staying for an average of 2.5-3 years on the island for\nvet school or medical school. The vet school on the island is Ross University\nSchool of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nThe tourism sector was badly hit by the effects of the hurricanes in 1998 and\n1999. The country had just started to rebuild after Georges in 1998 when Lenny\ncreated substantial damage in 1999. The Port Zante complex, where the pier and\nterminal buildings are located, suffered serious damage. In Nevis, the only\nlarge hotel was forced to close for 6 months, resulting in lay-offs of staff\n(although many were employed to re-landscape devastated gardens) and decreased\ngovernment revenue. Overall visitor arrivals, both of those staying over and\nthose on cruise ship calls, fell about 15 percent in 1999, with a resulting\ndecrease in visitor expenditure from the 1998 figure of US$75.7 million.\n\nA unique point of interest is that the island of St. Kitts possesses the only\nremaining active railway in the West Indies. This was built to move sugarcane\naround, and part of the railway remains in use for tourist tours.\n\nSt. Kitts is also home to Brimstone Hill Fortress, a UNESCO world heritage\nsite",

      "• The tourism industry in Saint Kitts and Nevis is characterized by a dual reliance on both short-term and long-term visitors.",
      "• Short-term visitors predominantly include Americans, Canadians, and nationals from other CARICOM countries who arrive either for day visits via cruise ships or for brief stays via Robert L Bradshaw International Airport.",
      "• Long-term visitors are primarily Americans and Canadians who stay on the island for an average duration of 2.5 to 3 years, mainly to attend veterinary or medical schools.",
      "• Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, located on the island, is a significant institution attracting long-term visitors for veterinary education.",

      "• The country had begun recovery efforts after Hurricane Georges in 1998 when Hurricane Lenny inflicted substantial additional damage in 1999.",
      "• The Port Zante complex, which houses the cruise ship pier and terminal buildings, sustained serious damage during these hurricanes.",
      "• On the island of Nevis, the only large hotel was compelled to close for six months following the hurricanes, which led to staff layoffs; however, many former employees were subsequently hired to assist in re-landscaping the devastated gardens.",

On Nevis, sea island cotton and coconuts are the major commodities.\nSweet potatoes, onions, tomatoes, cabbages, carrots, and breadfruit are grown\nfor local consumption on both islands, mostly by individual smallholders. In\n2001, agricultural products accounted for about 18.5% of total imports by\nvalue and 11.2% of exports; the government has embarked on a program to\nsubstitute for food imports.\n\nSugar estate lands were nationalized in 1975, and the sugar factory was\npurchased by the government the following year. The output of raw sugar\nslumped between 1986 and 1989, and as a result the government entered into a\nmanagement agreement with Booke and Tate of Great Britain in August 1991; a\nWorld Bank loan of US$1.9 million was utilized to provide financial stability.\nSugar production in 1999 was estimated at 197,000 tons. Faced with a sugar\nindustry that was finding it increasingly difficult to earn a profit, the\nGovernment of St. Kitts and Nevis embarked on a program to diversify the\nagricultural sector and stimulate the development of other sectors of the\neconomy, particularly tourism.
