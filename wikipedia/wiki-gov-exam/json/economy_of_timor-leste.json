    "text": "The **economy of Timor-Leste** is a lower-middle income economy as ranked by\nthe World Bank. It is placed 140th on the Human Development Index, indicating\na medium level of human development. 20% of the population is unemployed, and\n52.9% live on less than $1.25 a day. About half of the population is\nilliterate. At 27%, Timor-Leste's urbanisation rate is one of the lowest in\nthe world.\n\nIn 2007, a bad harvest caused a \"major food crisis\" in Timor-Leste. By\nNovember, eleven sub-districts still needed food supplied by international\naid.\n\nAccording to data gathered in the 2010 census, 87.7% of urban and 18.9% of\nrural households have electricity, for an overall average of 36.7%."

    "text": "Prior to and during colonisation, the island of Timor was best known for its\nsandalwood. The Portuguese colonial administration also granted concessions to\nOceanic Exploration Corporation to develop oil and gas deposits. However, this\nwas curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976.\n\nPetrochemical resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the\nTimor Gap Treaty in 1989. The treaty established guidelines for joint\nexploitation of seabed resources in the area of the \"gap\" left by then-\nPortuguese Timor in the maritime boundary agreed between the two countries in\n1972. Revenues from the \"joint\" area were to be divided 50-50. Woodside\nPetroleum and ConocoPhillips began development of some resources in the Timor\nGap on behalf of the two governments in 1992.\n\nIn late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of Timor-Leste was\ndestroyed by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias, and 260,000\npeople fled westward. From 2002 to 2005, an international program led by the\nUnited Nations, manned by civilian advisers, 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at\npeak) and 1,300 police officers, substantially reconstructed the\ninfrastructure. By mid-2002, all but about 50,000 of the refugees had\nreturned.\n\nThe economy grew by about 10% in 2011 and at a similar rate in 2012.\n\nWhile Timor-Leste gained revenue from offshore oil and gas reserves, little of\nit has been spent on the development of villages, which still rely on\nsubsistence farming. As of 2012[update], nearly half the East Timorese\npopulation was living in extreme poverty."

    "text": "The agriculture sector employs 80% of Timor-Leste's active population. In\n2009, about 67,000 households grew coffee in Timor-Leste, with a large\nproportion of those households being poor. Currently, the gross margins are\nabout $120 per hectare, with returns per labour-day of about $3.70. There were\n11,000 households growing mung beans as of 2009, most of them by subsistence\nfarming. 94% of domestic fish catch comes from the ocean, especially coastal\nfisheries. 66% of families are in part supported by these subsistence\nactivities, however the country as a whole does not produce enough food to be\nself-sustaining, and thus relies on imports. Coffee, rice, maize, coconuts,\ncassava, soybeans, bananas, mango, and sweet potatoes are cultivated here.\nWith 5,014 Metric Tons in 2019, the country was ranked number 42 among other\ncountries in Avocados Production.\n\nAfter petroleum, the second largest export is coffee, which generates about\n$10 million a year. 9,000 tonnes of coffee, 108 tonnes of cinnamon, and 161\ntonnes of cocoa were harvested in 2012 making the country the 40th ranked\nproducer of coffee, the 6th ranked producer of cinnamon and the 50th ranked\nproducer of cocoa worldwide. In 2019, 186 Metric Tons of cocoa beans were\nproduced and the country was number 48."

    "text": "The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to the Australia-\nbound Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop petroleum and natural gas\ndeposits in the waters southeast of Timor. However, this was curtailed by the\nIndonesian invasion in 1976.[_citation needed_] The resources were divided\nbetween Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989. Timor-Leste\ninherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained\nindependence.[_citation needed_] A provisional agreement (the Timor Sea\nTreaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent on 20 May 2002) defined a\nJoint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) and awarded 90% of revenues from\nexisting projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to Australia. An\nagreement in 2005 between the governments of Timor-Leste and Australia\nmandated that both countries put aside their dispute over maritime boundaries\nand that Timor-Leste would receive 50% of the revenues from the resource\nexploitation in the area (estimated at A$26 billion, or about US$20 billion\nover the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. In\n2013, Timor-Leste launched a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The\nHague to pull out of a gas treaty that it had signed with Australia, accusing\nthe Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) of bugging the East Timorese\ncabinet room in Dili in 2004.\n\nAt the time of independence Timor-Leste had per capita natural wealth\nequivalent to the wealth of an upper-middle income country. Over half of this\nwas in oil, and over a quarter natural gas. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was\nestablished in 2005 to turn these non-renewable resources into a more\nsustainable form of wealth. By 2009 it had a value of US$4.8 billion, and by\n2011 it had reached a worth of US$8.7 billion. Timor-Leste is labelled by the\nInternational Monetary Fund as the \"most oil-dependent economy in the world\".\nThe Petroleum Fund pays for nearly all of the government's annual budget,\nwhich increased from $70 million in 2004 to $1.3 billion in 2011, with a $1.8\nbillion proposal for 2012. East-Timor's income from oil and gas stands to\nincrease significantly after its cancellation of a controversial agreement\nwith Australia, which gave Australia half of the income from oil and gas from\n2006. From 2005 to 2021, $23 billion earned from oil sales has entered the\nfund. $8 billion has been generated from investments, while $12 billion has\nbeen spent. A decrease in oil and gas reserves led to decreasing HDI beginning\nin 2010. 80% of government spending comes from this fund, which as of 2021 had\n$19 billion, 10 times greater than the size of the national budget. As oil\nincome has decreased, the fund is at risk of being exhausted. Withdrawals have\nexceeded sustainable levels almost every year since 2009."

A provisional\nagreement (the Timor Sea Treaty, signed when Timor-Leste became independent in\n2002) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA), and awarded 90% of\nrevenues from existing projects in that area to Timor-Leste and 10% to\nAustralia. The first significant new development in the JPDA since East\nTimorese independence is the largest petroleum resource in the Timor Sea, the\nGreater Sunrise gas field. Its exploitation was the subject of separate\nagreements in 2003 and 2005. Only 20% of the field lies within the JPDA and\nthe rest in waters not subject to the treaty (though claimed by both\ncountries). The initial, temporary agreement gave 82% of revenues to Australia\nand only 18% to Timor-Leste.\n\nThe government of Timor-Leste has sought to negotiate a definite boundary with\nAustralia at the halfway line between the countries, in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The government of Australia\npreferred to establish the boundary at the end of the wide Australian\ncontinental shelf, as agreed with Indonesia in 1972 and 1991. Normally a\ndispute such as this would be referred to the International Court of Justice\nor the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for an impartial\ndecision, but the Australian government had withdrawn from these international\njurisdictions (solely on matters relating to maritime boundaries) shortly\nbefore East Timorese independence.\n\nNevertheless, under public and diplomatic pressure, the Australian government\noffered instead a last-minute concession solely on royalties from the Greater\nSunrise gas field. An agreement was signed in 2005 under which both countries\nwould set aside the dispute over the maritime boundary, and Timor-Leste would\nreceive 50% of the revenues (estimated at A$26 billion or about US$20 billion\nover the lifetime of the project) from the Greater Sunrise development. Other\ndevelopments within waters claimed by Timor-Leste but outside the JPDA\n(Laminaria-Corallina and Buffalo) continue to be exploited unilaterally by\nAustralia, however.\n\nSome proceeds from Timor-Leste's petroleum royalties are directed to the\ncountry's sovereign wealth fund, the Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund."
