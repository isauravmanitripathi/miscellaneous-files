    "text": "Sugarcane. Working in the salt marshes.\n\nIn 1961, Professor James Meade painted a bleak picture of the economic\nprospects of Mauritius, which then had a population of 650,000. All the\ndisadvantages associated with smallness of island states weighed heavily in\nhis conviction that Mauritius was caught in a Malthusian trap and, therefore,\nif economic progress could at all be achieved, it would be to a very limited\nextent.[_citation needed_] Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed\nfrom a low-income, agriculturally based economy to an upper-middle income\ndiversified economy with growing industrial, financial, ICT and tourist\nsectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been roughly 4%. This\ncompares very favourably with other sub-Saharan African countries and is\nlargely due to sustained progress in economic conditions; between 1977 and\n2008, growth averaged 4.6% compared with a 2.9% average in sub-Saharan Africa.\nAlso important is that it has achieved what few fast growing economies\nachieve, a more equitable income distribution and inequality (as measured by\nthe Gini coefficient) fell from 45.7 to 38.9 between 1980 and 2006. This\nremarkable achievement has been reflected in increased life expectancy,\nlowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. Sugarcane is\ngrown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 25% of export\nearnings.[_citation needed_] The government's development strategy centres on\nexpanding local financial institutions and building a domestic information\ntelecommunications industry. Mauritius has attracted more than 9,000 offshore\nentities, many aimed at commerce in India and South Africa, and investment in\nthe banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its\nstrong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa\nGrowth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).[_citation needed_]\n\nWith a well-developed legal and commercial infrastructure and a tradition of\nentrepreneurship and representative government, Mauritius is one of the\ndeveloping world's most successful democracies. The economy has shown a\nconsiderable degree of resilience, and an environment already conducive to\ndynamic entrepreneurial activity has moved further toward economic freedom.\nThe island's institutional advantages are noticeable. A transparent and well-\ndefined investment code and legal system have made the foreign investment\nclimate in Mauritius one of the best in the region.[_citation needed_]\nTaxation is competitive and efficient. The economy is increasingly\ndiversified, with significant private-sector activity in sugar, tourism,\neconomic processing zones, and financial services, particularly in offshore\nenterprises.[_citation needed_] The government is trying to modernize the\nsugar and textile industries, which in the past were overly dependent on trade\npreferences, while promoting diversification into such areas as information\nand communications technology, financial and business services, seafood\nprocessing and exports, and free trade zones. Agriculture and industry have\nbecome less important to the economy, and services, especially tourism,\naccounted for over 72 percent of GDP.[_when?_] The government still owns\nutilities and controls imports of rice, flour, petroleum products, and\ncement.[_citation needed_]\n\nEurope and the United States are the traditional export markets of Mauritius;\npreferential trading deals with partners such as the European Union and the\nUnited States in some economic sectors, such as the sugar industry and in\ntextile and clothing sectors, resulted in the significant growth of the total\nexports of Mauritius, especially from the 1970s to the 1990s. Clothing and\ntextile industry in Mauritius started in the 1970s, when foreign investors\n(mainly coming from Hong Kong) started setting up firms which would assemble\nimported textiles into clothing; most of those activities happed in the export\nprocessing zones (EPZs). The clothing and textile sector spearheaded the\nindustrialization process in Mauritius; in 2019 it represented around 43% of\nexports."

    "text": "The Mauritian economy has undergone remarkable transformations since\nindependence. From a poor country with high unemployment exporting mainly\nsugar and buffeted by the vagaries of world demand, Mauritius has become\nrelatively prosperous and diverse, although not without problems.\n\nThe 1970s were marked by a strong government commitment to diversify the\neconomy and to provide more high-paying jobs to the population. The promotion\nof tourism and the creation of the EPZs did much to attain these goals.\nBetween 1971 and 1977, about 64,000 jobs were created. However, in the rush to\nmake work, the government allowed EPZ firms to deny their workers fair wages,\nthe right to organize and strike, and the health and social benefits afforded\nother Mauritian workers. The boom in the mid-1970s was also fuelled by\nincreased foreign aid and exceptional sugar crops, coupled with high world\nprices.\n\nThe economic situation deteriorated in the late 1970s. Petroleum prices rose,\nthe sugar boom ended, and the balance of payments deficit steadily rose as\nimports outpaced exports; by 1979 the deficit amounted to a staggering US$111\nmillion. Mauritius approached the IMF and the World Bank for assistance. In\nexchange for loans and credits to help pay for imports, the government agreed\nto institute certain measures, including cutting food subsidies, devaluing the\ncurrency, and limiting government wage increases.\n\nBy the 1980s, thanks to a widespread political consensus on broad policy\nmeasures, the economy experienced steady growth, declining inflation, high\nemployment, and increased domestic savings. The EPZ with investment\nprincipally from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and came into its own,\nsurpassing sugar as the principal export-earning sector and employing more\nworkers than the sugar industry and the government combined, previously the\ntwo largest employers. In 1986 Mauritius had its first trade surplus in twelve\nyears. Tourism also boomed, with a concomitant expansion in the number of\nhotel beds and air flights. An aura of optimism accompanied the country's\neconomic success and prompted comparisons with other Asian countries that had\ndynamic economies, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea.\n\nThe economy had slowed down by the late 1980s and early 1990s, but the\ngovernment was optimistic that it could ensure the long-term prosperity of the\ncountry by drawing up and implementing prudent development plans. A stock\nexchange opened in Port Louis in 1989. As of 1993, Mauritius had a gross\ndomestic product (GDP) estimated at US$8.6 billion, with a growth rate of 5.5\npercent, and an inflation rate of 10.5 percent.\n\nMauritius has always depended on external financial flows, such as tourism\nrevenues, offshore financing and foreign aid."

    "text": "Mauritius has followed a pragmatic development strategy in which\nliberalisation process was sequenced and tailored to its competitive\nadvantages and weaknesses. The export-orientated approach has encouraged\nliberalisation supported by strong state involvement as a facilitator (of the\nenabling environment for the private sector); as operator (to encourage\ncompetition); and as regulator (to protect the economy as well as vulnerable\ngroups and sectors from shocks). Strategies were evidence-based and adapted\naccording to results. There has been consistency and stability, regardless of\nwhich political party is in power.\n\nLiberalisation occurred in phases that were initiated to build on advantages\nthe economy enjoyed on the international market.\n\n* 1970s: Mauritius profited from sugar rents, established an export processing zone EPZ and successfully attracted capital and foreign investment in manufacturing, from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n* 1980s–1990s: EPZ expanded and led to a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and tourism. Preferential access to sugar and clothing markets amounted to 7% of GDP in the 1980s and 4.5% in the 1990s, capital and current accounts were liberalised, contributing to an investment and employment boom and the high inflow of FDI brought with it managerial skills.\n* 1990s–2010: Further diversification, liberalisation and investment as Chinese investors left to pursue investments in Africa and China."

Education and health\nservices are free and have been expanded in recent years, in order to create\nfurther employment opportunities and ensuring inclusive growth. The educated\nand adaptable workforce were essential elements of 1980s export-orientated\ngrowth. Around 90% of entrepreneurs in the export processing zone (EPZ) and in\nthe manufacturing sector were eventually Mauritian nationals, businesspeople\nhad the human capital, education and knowledge needed to exploit market\nopportunities. According to the Government of Mauritius the general outlook\nfor the manufacturing sector is positive, as the country offers many\nopportunities to entrepreneurs across the various value chains but\ninsufficient skilled labour and limited research and development will remain\nimpediments to potentially higher growth in this sector."

    "text": "Mauritius faces significant environmental challenges such as flash floods and\ncoastal erosion, which have substantial economic implications. In June 2024,\nthe government announced plans to introduce a 2% climate levy on company\nprofits to finance projects that combat climate change and restore the natural\necosystem. Companies with sales of less than 50 million rupees ($1.06 million)\nwill be exempt from this levy. The proceeds from this corporate responsibility\nlevy will be used to support national initiatives to protect, manage, invest\nin, and restore the country's natural ecosystem and combat the effects of\nclimate change. The nation of 1.26 million people is experiencing more climate\nchange-related events and needs to mobilize 300 billion rupees to meet its\nadaptation and mitigation goals.\n\nIn 2024, flash floods brought the capital, Port Louis, to a halt, causing\nsignificant disruptions in banking and market activities. Tourism, a crucial\nsource of foreign currency for Mauritius, is expected to generate over $2\nbillion in earnings from visitors this year. However, more than 37 kilometres\n(23 mi) of the coastline have been affected by erosion, posing a threat to\nthis vital industry. In response, the government has allocated 3.2 billion\nrupees to the new climate fund, which will be used to rehabilitate\napproximately 26 kilometres (16 mi) of shoreline and 30 degraded sites. For\nthe fiscal year ending in June 2025, Mauritius' government expenditure is\nprojected to rise by 17% to 237.3 billion rupees, with revenue expected to\ngrow by 20% to 210.5 billion rupees. This will narrow the fiscal gap to 3.4%\nof GDP from 3.9% in 2024. Borrowing requirements will increase to 38 billion\nrupees from 30.7 billion rupees, including 14 billion rupees in foreign\nfinancing. Despite higher borrowing, public debt as a percentage of GDP is\nprojected to decrease to 71.5% from 74.5% in 2024, though in absolute terms,\nit will rise to 567.49 billion rupees from 524.6 billion rupees. Additionally,\na government-support agreement is expected to unlock over 15 billion rupees in\nprivate-sector investment in renewable energy projects, demonstrating the\ngovernment's commitment to sustainable development and economic resilience."
