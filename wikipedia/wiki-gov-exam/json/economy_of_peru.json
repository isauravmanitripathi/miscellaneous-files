    "text": "The **economy of Peru** is an emerging, mixed economy characterized by a high\nlevel of foreign trade and an upper middle income economy as classified by the\nWorld Bank. Peru has the forty-seventh largest economy in the world by total\nGDP and currently experiences a high human development index. The country was\none of the world's fastest-growing economies in 2012, with a GDP growth rate\nof 6.3%. The economy was expected to increase 9.3% in 2021, in a rebound from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Peru has signed a number of free trade\nagreements with its main trade partners. China became the nation's largest\ntrading partner following the China–Peru Free Trade Agreement signed on 28\nApril 2009. Additional free trade agreements have been signed with the United\nStates in 2006, Japan in 2011 and the European Union in 2012. Trade and\nindustry are centralized in Lima while agricultural exports have led to\nregional development within the nation.\n\nPeru's economy is dependent on commodity exports, making it vulnerable to\nprice volatility in international markets. The Government of Peru has\nhistorically shown limited involvement in the public sector, as the economy\nhas often relied on commodity booms. The extraction of these commodities has\nled to conflicts within the country due to their environmental and social\nimpacts.\n\nFollowing the independence of Peru from the Spanish Empire, the economic elite\nfocused their power on the coastal regions through _centralismo_ , while the\nrural provinces were governed by existing serfdom practices by _hacienda_\nlandowners. This model essentially continued until 1968 when General Juan\nVelasco Alvarado took power, leading a dictatorship that increased social\nspending and removing the power of landowners, which resulted with a power\nvacuum in the 1970s that saw the rise of communist guerilla group Shining\nPath. Beginning in the 1980s, Peru faced economic difficulties as a result of\nthe early 1980s recession and the internal conflict in Peru during its Lost\nDecade. The government of Alan García enacted price controls that resulted in\nhyperinflation. In response, the armed forces of Peru drafted Plan Verde, an\noperation to create a neoliberal, open market economy. This was reportedly\nexecuted by the government of Alberto Fujimori, beside prescriptions from\neconomist Hernando de Soto, during a period known as \"Fujishock\". During this\nshock, price controls were discontinued, the privatization of state-run\norganizations occurred and the promotion of foreign investments happened\nthrough the removal of regulations. The economic measures of the Fujimori\nadministration made the country macro-economically stable.\n\nDevelopment in Peru increased following the 2000s commodities boom while\ngovernment finances, poverty reduction and progress in social sectors\nimproved. The nation has more recently adopted the Lima Consensus, an economic\nideology of neoliberalism, deregulation and free market policies that has made\nforeign portfolio investment in Peru attractive. Inflation in 2012 was the\nlowest in Latin America at 1.8%, with the most recent annual rate standing at\n1.9% in 2020. Though statistical poverty has decreased significantly – from\nnearly 60% in 2004 to 20.5% in 2018.\n\nPeruvian economic performance has been tied to exports, which provide hard\ncurrency to finance imports and external debt payments, though in recent\ndecades the economy has begun to diversify. Peru's main exports are copper,\ngold, zinc, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, manufactures, machinery,\nservices and fish meal. The country's major trade partners are the United\nStates, China, Brazil, the European Union and Chile. Although exports have\nprovided substantial revenue, self-sustained growth and a more egalitarian\ndistribution of income have proven elusive. Services account for 59.9% of\nPeruvian gross domestic product, followed by industry (32.7%) and agriculture\n(7.6%). Recent economic growth has been fueled by macroeconomic stability,\nimproved terms of trade, as well as rising investment and consumption.",

Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( October 2011)_\n---|---\n\nThe virtues of today's new multi-polar world for Peru are many. At 30 million\npeople, Peru is neither too small to matter nor so big it is going to be a\npower in its own right. Midsized states, benefits from a world where it is no\nlonger mandatory to pick a big-power patron.\n\nWith expanding ports loading up boats to China on one side, and a new\nsuperhighway to Brazil on the other, along with a free trade agreement with\nthe United States in its hip pocket, Peru seems well-positioned to prosper in\nthe coming years. But former President Toledo may not be hyperbolic when he\nworries the future stability of the state may depend on its willingness to\ndistribute wealth more evenly.\n\nForecasts for the medium- and long-term remain highly positive. Peru's real\nGDP growth in 2007 was (8.3%) and largest in Latin America in 2008 was an\noutstanding 9.8%, the highest in the world. Inflation remained low, at about\n3%, while the budget surplus is expected to remain at about 1% of\nGDP.[_citation needed_] Private investment should keep growing at a rate of\n15% a year.[_citation needed_] Exports and imports are expected to keep\nrising.[_citation needed_] The unemployment and underemployment indexes (5.2%\nand 34%, respectively, in Lima) should keep coming down as the economy\ngrows[_citation needed_], other cities in Peru like Cajamarca, Ica, Cuzco and\nTrujillo are starting to show less unemployment nowadays.[_citation needed_]\nThe country is likely to attract future domestic and foreign investment in\ntourism, agriculture, mining, petroleum and natural gas, power industries and\nfinancial institutions. According to the IMF and the World Bank, Peruvian GDP\neconomic growth between 2007 and 2013 was:\n\nIn 2007 at 8.9%, in 2008 at 9.7%, in 2009 at 0.9%, in 2010 at 8.6%, in 2011 at\n6.0%, in 2012 at 6,3% and in 2013 at 5.3%.\n\nTherefore, Peruvian GDP grew in the 2007–2013 6 years period an outstanding\nnet growth of 45.7% or a 7.61% yearly average. The IMF forecast for Peru's\neconomic growth for the next 6 years 2013–2019 is a 7% yearly growth.\n\nIn FY 2011 for the first time since 1991 the size of the Peruvian economy\nsurpassed the Chilean economy. Peru now is the fifth major economy in South\nAmerica and is expected to become the fourth South American economy in 2018 by\nsurpassing Venezuela.\n\nPrivate investment reached 25% of the GDP in 2007, and has remained stable\nthrough 2010; and inflation is under control at an average 2% per year for the\nnext 5 years. International Debt will reach 25% of the GDP by 2010, down from\n35% in 2006, and will be only 12% of the GDP by 2015.[_citation needed_] The\nInternational Monetary Reserves of the National Reserve Bank (Dollar, Euro,\nYen, Gold, and other currencies) reached US$27 billion by the end of 2007, and\nUS$31 billion at the end of 2008. Currently reserves are at a US$73 billion\nlevel for end of FY 2013, which more than doubles the total foreign debt of\nPeru which is US$30 billion at the end of FY 2013.\n\nExports are growing at a pace of 25% and reached US$28 billion at the end of\n2007 and US$30 billion at the end of 2010. In FY 2012 Peruvian exports reached\na total of US$46 billion.\n\nHigh technological investment is growing fast in Peru, and will be 10% of the\nGDP by 2010.[_citation needed_]",

    "text": "The Peruvian coca and cocaine industry is as huge as it is today because of\nadvanced industrial nations’ demand for drugs. This high demand has created a\nframework of dependence on \"coca-dollars\" and on US drug policy. Money from\ncocaine trafficking feeds local economies, supports inflation, and even causes\nsocial changes such as cocaine smoking among indigenous Peruvians. Coca\nfarming today is still a significant source of income for peasants, as it\naccounts for 48% of total net family income in the high coca-growing Apurímac\nRiver region. In an effort to reduce drug use in America, for the past 50\nyears the US government together with the United Nations have been waging a\nwar on drugs. The US Drug Control Program maintains that \"eliminating the\ncultivation of illicit coca and opium is the best approach to combating\ncocaine and heroin availability in the US.\"\n\nWith US government cooperation, the Peruvian Government installed the National\nPlan for the Prevention and Control of Drugs in 1995. This government\nprohibition of narcotics trafficking in Peru has resulted in a 70% reduction\nof coca leaf cultivation since 1995. However the reduction in cultivation may\nnot have actual effects on cocaine production, as recent advances in coca\ngrowing and more efficient processing methods allow for greater cocaine yield.\nThe size of the narcotics industry as a part of the national economy is\ndifficult to measure, but estimates range from $300–$600 million. An estimated\n200,000 Peruvian households have economies based on the production, refining,\nor distribution of coca. Many economists believe that large flows of dollars\ninto the banking system contribute to the traditional depression of the dollar\nexchange rate vis-a-vis the sol. The Central Bank engages in open market\nactivities to prevent the price of the sol from rising to levels that would\ncause Peruvian exports to become prohibitively expensive.\n\nHurt economically by Peruvian Air Force interdiction efforts in the mid-1990s,\ndrug traffickers are now using land and river routes as well as aircraft to\ntransport cocaine paste and, increasingly, refined cocaine to consumers around\nand out of the country. The Air Bridge Denial Program was suspended in April\n2001 after the Peruvian Air Force and strength of the U.S. DEA misidentified a\ncivilian aircraft as a drug trafficker and shot it down, killing two American\ncitizens on board. Peru continues to arrest drug traffickers and seize drugs\nand precursor chemicals, destroy coca labs, disable clandestine airstrips, and\nprosecute officials involved in narcotics corruption.\n\nWorking with limited aid of the U.S. Agency for International Development\n(USAID), the Peruvian Government carries out alternative development programs\nin the leading coca-growing areas in an effort to convince coca farmers not to\ngrow that crop. Although the government previously eradicated only coca seed\nbeds, in 1998 and 1999 it began to eradicate mature coca being grown in\nnational parks and elsewhere in the main coca growing valleys. In 1999 the\ngovernment eradicated more than 150 km2 of coca; this figure declined to 65\nkm2 in 2000, due largely to political instability. The government agency\n\"Contradrogas\", founded in 1996, facilitates coordination among Peruvian\nGovernment agencies working on counter-narcotics issues. Alternative crops,\nhowever, are not economically comparable to coca. 2004 prices indicate an\nannual income per hectare of $600 for coffee and $1000 for cocoa, versus up to\n$7500 for a hectare of coca.\n\nFor the global push towards a green economy, sustainability depends on access\nto minerals such as copper, lithium, and rare earth elements. Peru, as one of\nthe most resource-rich nations in the world, plays an important role. Peru is\ncurrently considered the world’s second-largest exporter of minerals such as\ncopper, silver, zinc, and lithium; these minerals are essential to the\ntechnologies that drive change in industry to a cleaner and more sustainable\nfuture. This year, in August 2024, Peru and the United States signed a\nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) for greater foreign direct investment (FDI)\nand shared technological innovation. The MOU represents Peru as the US supply\nfor the accessibility of essential minerals, guaranteeing responsible\nextraction processes. Peru has more than 6 t of lithium and managed 31 active\ncopper projects with almost US$40 billion in potential investments. Thus, this\npartnership marks a new era for the Peruvian economy.

The agreement was implemented\non 1 February 2009.\n\nPeru looks to the agreement are to:\n\n* Consolidate and extend the trade preferences under ATPDEA\n* Attract foreign investment\n* Generate employment\n* Enhance the country's competitiveness within the region\n* Increase workers' income\n* Curb poverty levels\n* Create and export sugar cane ethanol\n\nThe United States looks to the agreement to:\n\n* Improve access to goods and services\n* Strengthen its investments\n* Promote security and democracy\n* Fight against drug trafficking\n\nThe U.S.-Peru agreement has faced criticism. In Peru, the treaty was\nchampioned by Toledo, and supported to different extents by former President\nAlan García and candidates Lourdes Flores and Valentín Paniagua. Ollanta\nHumala has been its most vocal critic. Humala's Union for Peru won 45 of 120\nseats in Congress in 2006, the largest share by a single party, prompting\ndebate on ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn\nin. Some Congressmen-elect interrupted the debate after forcibly entering\nCongress in an attempt to stop the agreement ratification.\n\nOne controversial element of the agreement relates to land resources. Laura\nCarlsen, of the Center for International Policy, who is also a contributor to\nForeign Policy in Focus notes that \"Indigenous organizations warn that this\nruling effectively opens up 45 million hectares to foreign investment and\ntimber, oil, and mining exploitation.\"\n\nHowever, most of the criticism of the agreement has focused on its potential\nimpact on Peru's agricultural sector. By planting crops to similar to those\nsubsidized by the U.S., Peru faced a competitive disadvantage in the\nproduction of agricultural products because poor farming families with\ninadequate tools, technology and techniques may not be able to produce crops\nat low enough prices to export. In response to these concerns, Peruvian\nlawmakers created a Compensation Fund which directed $34 million per year to\ncotton, maize/corn, and wheat producers for a five-year period to help them\nadjust to the new competitive pressures.\n\nToledo is therefore a market-oriented politician who continued to globalize\nPeru's economy and is rumored to be getting ready for another run for\npresident. Toledo says bluntly that unless the poorest in the country are\nbetter educated, better paid, housed, and fed, the Peruvian economic miracle\nwill stall.",
