    "text": "The economy of Russia is an emerging and developing, high-income,\nindustrialized, mixed market-oriented economy. It has the eleventh-largest\neconomy in the world by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest economy by GDP\n(PPP). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, its GDP measured in nominal\nterms fluctuates sharply. Russia was the last major economy to join the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), becoming a member in 2012.\n\nRussia has large amounts of energy resources throughout its vast landmass,\nparticularly natural gas and petroleum, which play a crucial role in its\nenergy self-sufficiency and exports. The country has been widely described as\nan energy superpower; with it having the largest natural gas reserves in the\nworld, the second-largest coal reserves, the eighth-largest oil reserves, and\nthe largest oil shale reserves in Europe. Russia is the world's leading\nnatural gas exporter, the second-largest natural gas producer, the second-\nlargest oil exporter and producer, and the third-largest coal exporter. Its\nforeign exchange reserves are the fifth-largest in the world. Russia has a\nlabour force of about 73 million people, which is the eighth-largest in the\nworld. It is the third-largest exporter of arms in the world. The large oil\nand gas sector accounted up to 30% of Russia's federal budget revenues in\n2024, down from 50% in the mid-2010s, suggesting economic diversification.\n\nRussia's human development is ranked as \"very high\" in the annual Human\nDevelopment Index. Roughly 70% of Russia's total GDP is driven by domestic\nconsumption, and the country has the world's twelfth-largest consumer market.\nIts social security system comprised roughly 16% of the total GDP in 2015.\nRussia has the fifth-highest number of billionaires in the world. However, its\nincome inequality remains comparatively high, caused by the variance of\nnatural resources among its federal subjects, leading to regional economic\ndisparities. High levels of corruption, a shrinking labor force, and an aging\nand declining population also remain major barriers to future economic growth.\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country has faced\nextensive sanctions and other negative financial actions from the Western\nworld and its allies which have the aim of isolating the Russian economy from\nthe Western financial system. However, Russia's economy has shown resilience\nto such measures broadly, and has maintained economic stability and\ngrowth—driven primarily by high military expenditure, rising household\nconsumption and wages, low unemployment, and increased government spending.\nYet, inflation has remained comparatively high, with experts predicting the\nsanctions will have a long-term negative effect on the Russian economy."

    "text": "The Russian economy has been volatile over the past multiple decades. After\n1989, its institutional environment was transformed from a command economy\nbased upon socialist organizations to a capitalistic system. Its industrial\nstructure dramatically shifted away over the course of several years from\nheavy investment in manufacturing as well as in traditional Soviet agriculture\ntowards free market related developments in natural gas and oil extraction in\nadditional to businesses engaged in mining. A service economy also expanded\nduring this time. The academic analyst Richard Connolly has argued that, over\nthe last four centuries in a broad sense, there were four main characteristics\nof the Russian economy that have shaped the system and persisted despite the\npolitical upheavals. First of all the weakness of the legal system means that\nimpartial courts do not rule and contracts are problematic. Second is the\nunderdevelopment of modern economic activities, with very basic peasant\nagriculture dominant into the 1930s. Third is technological underdevelopment,\neased somewhat by borrowing from the West in the 1920s. And fourth lower\nliving standards compared to Western Europe and North America."

After the mid 18th century, the Russian economy\nstagnated and declined. In the 18th century, Russian national income per\ncapita was about 40–70% of British per capita income but higher than Poland's.\nBy 1860, Russian GDP per capita was similar to that of Japan; one-third of GDP\nper capita in the United States or the United Kingdom; and twice that of China\nor India. Russia was a late industrializer. Over the course of the late 19th\ncentury and early 20th century, Russia's railroad system expanded\nconsiderably, enabling greater industrialization.\n\nSerfdom, which held back development of the wage labor market and created a\nshortage of labor for industry, was abolished in 1861. In the aftermath, GDP\nper capita was volatile and did not substantially increase. Steady economic\ngrowth began in the 1890s, alongside a structural transformation of the\nRussian economy. By the time World War I started, more than half the Russian\neconomy was still devoted to agriculture. By the early 20th century, the\nRussian economy had fallen further behind the American and British economies.\nFrom the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the economy grew at a\nsimilar pace as the Japanese economy and faster than the Brazilian, Indian and\nChinese economies."

    "text": "Beginning in 1928, the course of the Soviet Union's economy was guided by a\nseries of five-year plans. By the 1950s, the Soviet Union had rapidly evolved\nfrom a mainly agrarian society into a major industrial power. By the 1970s the\nSoviet Union was in an Era of Stagnation. The complex demands of the modern\neconomy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central\nplanners. The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became\noverwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration\nforeclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the\nenterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers,\nand suppliers.\n\nWorkers of Moscow Likhachev Automotive Plant, 1963\n\nFrom 1975 to 1985, corruption and data manipulation became common practice\nwithin the bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas, thus\nentrenching the crisis. Starting in 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to\naddress economic problems by moving towards a market-oriented socialist\neconomy. Gorbachev's policies of Perestroika failed to rejuvenate the Soviet\neconomy; instead, a process of political and economic disintegration\nculminated in the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991."

    "text": "Russian inflation rate 1993-2022 Main Directorate of the Bank of Russia for\nthe Central Federal District GDP per capita (PPP) in Russia, 1992-2023 (in\ninternational dollars)\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia underwent a radical\ntransformation, moving from a centrally planned economy to a globally\nintegrated market economy. Corrupt and haphazard privatization processes\nturned over major state-owned firms to politically connected \"oligarchs\",\nwhich has left equity ownership highly concentrated.\n\nYeltsin's program of radical, market-oriented reform came to be known as a\n\"shock therapy\". It was based on the policies associated with the Washington\nConsensus, recommendations of the IMF and a group of top American economists,\nincluding Larry Summers who in 1994 urged for \"the three\n'-ations'—privatization, stabilization, and liberalization\" to be \"completed\nas soon as possible.\" With deep corruption afflicting the process, the result\nwas disastrous, with real GDP falling by more than 40% by 1999, hyperinflation\nwhich wiped out personal savings, crime and destitution spreading rapidly. The\njump in prices from shock therapy wiped out the modest savings accumulated by\nRussians under socialism and resulted in a regressive redistribution of wealth\nin favour of elites who owned non-monetary assets.\n\nShock therapy was accompanied by a drop in the standard of living, including\nsurging economic inequality and poverty, along with increased excess mortality\nand a decline in life expectancy. Russia suffered the largest peacetime rise\nin mortality ever experienced by an industrialized country. Likewise, the\nconsumption of meat decreased: in 1990, an average citizen of the RSFSR\nconsumed 63 kg of meat a year; by 1999, it had decreased to 45 kg.\n\nThe majority of state enterprises were privatized amid great controversy and\nsubsequently came to be owned by insiders for far less than they were worth.\nFor example, the director of a factory during the Soviet regime would often\nbecome the owner of the same enterprise. Under the government's cover,\noutrageous financial manipulations were performed that enriched a narrow group\nof individuals at key positions of business and government. Many of them\npromptly invested their newfound wealth abroad, producing an enormous capital\nflight. This rapid privatization of public assets, and the widespread\ncorruption associated with it, became widely known throughout Russia as\n\"prikhvatizatisiya,\" or \"grab-itization.\"\n\nDifficulties in collecting government revenues amid the collapsing economy and\ndependence on short-term borrowing to finance budget deficits led to the 1998\nRussian financial crisis.\n\nIn the 1990s, Russia was a major borrower from the International Monetary\nFund, with loan facilities totalling $20 billion. The IMF was criticised for\nlending so much, as Russia introduced little of the reforms promised for the\nmoney and a large part of these funds could have been \"diverted from their\nintended purpose and included in the flows of capital that left the country\nillegally\".\n\nOn 24 September 1993, at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(CIS) Council of Heads of State in Moscow, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan signed the\nTreaty on the creation of an Economic Union which reinforces by an\ninternational agreement the intention to create an economic union through the\nstep-by-step creation of a free trade area, a customs union and conditions for\nthe free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. All these countries\nhave ratified the Treaty and it entered into force on 14 January 1994.\nTurkmenistan and Georgia joined in 1994 and ratified the Treaty, but Georgia\nwithdrew in 2009.\n\nOn 15 April 1994, at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\nCouncil of Heads of State in Moscow, all 12 post-Soviet states signed the\ninternational Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area in order to\nmove towards the creation of an economic union. Article 17 also confirmed the\nintention to conclude a free trade agreement in services. Article 1 indicated\nthat this was \"the first stage of the creation of the Economic Union\", but in\n1999 the countries agreed to remove this phrase from the agreement. Russia\nconcluded bilateral free trade agreements with all CIS countries and did not\nswitch to a multilateral free trade regime in 1999. Bilateral free trade\nagreements, except for Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (all of these are\nin force as of 2024), ceased to apply only after 2012 with Russia's accession\nto the new multilateral CIS free trade area.\n\nFurther integration took place outside the legal framework of the CIS.\nPursuant to the Treaty on the creation of an Economic Union, the Agreement on\nthe Customs Union between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus\nwas signed on 6 January 1995 in Minsk. The Government of the Republic of\nBelarus and the Government of the Russian Federation, on the one side, and the\nGovernment of the Republic of Kazakhstan, on the other side, signed an\nAgreement on the Customs Union in Moscow on 20 January 1995 in order to move\ntowards the creation of an economic union as envisaged by the treaty. The\nimplementation of these agreements made it possible to launch the Customs\nUnion of the Eurasian Economic Community in 2010. According to the database of\ninternational treaties of the Eurasian Economic Union, these agreements are\nstill in force as of 2024 and apply in part not contrary to the Treaty on the\nEurasian Economic Union.\n\nInternational agreements such as the following have further deepened trade and\neconomic relations and integration with Belarus. The Community of Belarus and\nRussia was founded on 2 April 1996. The \"Treaty on the Union between Belarus\nand Russia\" was signed on 2 April 1997. And finally the Treaty on the Creation\nof a Union State of Russia and Belarus was signed on 8 December 1999."

    "text": "Price of oil in the 2000s\n\nRussia recovered quickly from the August 1998 financial crash, partly because\nof a devaluation of the ruble, which made domestic producers more competitive\nnationally and internationally.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, significant pro-growth economic reforms included a\ncomprehensive tax reform, which introduced a flat income tax of 13%; and a\nbroad effort at deregulation which benefited small and medium-sized\nenterprises.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2008, Russian economy got a major boost from rising commodity\nprices. GDP grew on average 7% per year. Disposable incomes more than doubled\nand in dollar-denominated terms increased eightfold. The volume of consumer\ncredit between 2000 and 2006 increased 45 times, fuelling a boom in private\nconsumption. The number of people living below poverty line declined from 30%\nin 2000 to 14% in 2008.\n\nRussia repaid its borrowing of $3.3 billion from the IMF three years early in\n2005.\n\nInflation remained a problem however, as the central bank aggressively\nexpanded money supply to combat appreciation of the ruble. Nevertheless, in\n2007 the World Bank declared that the Russian economy achieved \"unprecedented\nmacroeconomic stability\". Until October 2007, Russia maintained impressive\nfiscal discipline with budget surpluses every year from 2000."

    "text": "Changes in the credit rating (foreign) of Russia, Standard & Poor's\n\nRussian banks were affected by the 2008 financial crisis, though no long term\ndamage was done due to a proactive and timely response by the government and\ncentral bank. A sharp, but brief recession in Russia was followed by a strong\nrecovery beginning in late 2009.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2012, Russia's energy exports fuelled a rapid growth in\nliving standards, with real disposable income rising by 160%. In dollar-\ndenominated terms this amounted to a more than sevenfold increase in\ndisposable incomes since 2000. In the same period, unemployment and poverty\nmore than halved and Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction also rose\nsignificantly. This growth was a combined result of the 2000s commodities\nboom, high oil prices, as well as prudent economic and fiscal policies.\nHowever, these gains have been distributed unevenly, as the 110 wealthiest\nindividuals were found in a report by Credit Suisse to own 35% of all\nfinancial assets held by Russian households. Russia also has the second-\nlargest volume of illicit money outflows, having lost over $880 billion\nbetween 2002 and 2011 in this way. Since 2008 Forbes has repeatedly named\nMoscow the \"billionaire capital of the world\".\n\nIn July 2010, Russia, together with Belarus and Kazakhstan, became a founding\nmember of the Customs Union of the Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC), and\nthe EurAsEC Single Economic Space, a common market of the same countries, came\ninto force on 1 January 2012, superseding the bilateral agreements on free\ntrade. At the same time Russia's membership to the WTO was accepted in 2011.\nRussia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 22 August 2012 after 19\nyears of negotiations. On 20 September 2012, the multi-lateral Free Trade Area\nof the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS FTA) came into force for Russia\nand subsequently superseded previous bilateral agreements among 9\nparticipating post-Soviet states. In 2015, Russia became a founding member of\nthe Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which replaced EurAsEC and envisaged a\nsupranational economic union (the deepest stage of economic integration).\n\nRapid GDP and income growth continued until 2013. The most important topic of\ndiscussion in the economy for a decade was the middle-income trap. In 2013,\nthe World Bank announced that Russia had graduated to a high-income economy\nbased on the results of 2012 but in 2016 it was reclassified as an upper-\nmiddle income economy due to changes in the exchange rate of the Russian\nruble, which is a floating currency. While the UN Human Development Index,\nwhich assesses progress in the standard of living, health and education, ranks\nRussia among the 'very high human development' countries.\n\nRussian leaders repeatedly spoke of the need to diversify the economy away\nfrom its dependence on oil and gas and foster a high-technology sector. In\n2012 oil, gas and petroleum products accounted for over 70% of total exports.\nThis economic model appeared to show its limits, when after years of strong\nperformance, the Russian economy expanded by a mere 1.3% in 2013. Several\nreasons were proposed to explain the slowdown, including a prolonged recession\nin the EU, which is Russia's largest trading partner, stagnant oil prices,\nlack of spare industrial capacity and demographic problems. Political turmoil\nin neighbouring Ukraine added to the uncertainty and suppressed investment."

Russia has the world's largest reserves.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and Russia's involvement in\nthe ongoing War in Donbas, the United States, the European Union, Canada, and\nJapan imposed sanctions on Russia. This led to the decline of the Russian\nruble and sparked fears of a Russian financial crisis. Russia responded with\nsanctions against a number of countries, including a one-year period of total\nban on food imports from the European Union and the United States.\n\nAccording to the Russian economic ministry in July 2014, GDP growth in the\nfirst half of 2014 was 1%. The ministry projected growth of 0.5% for 2014. The\nRussian economy grew by a better than expected 0.6% in 2014. Russia is rated\none of the most unequal of the world's major economies.\n\nAs a result of the World Bank's designation of a high-income economy, Barack\nObama issued a proclamation 9188: \"I have determined that Russia is\nsufficiently advanced in economic development and improved in trade\ncompetitiveness that it is appropriate to terminate the designation of Russia\nas a beneficiary developing country effective October 3, 2014.\" U.S. Customs\nand Border Protection (CBP) indicated that Russia formally graduated from the\nGSP program on 4 October 2014.\n\nAs of 2015, real income was still lower for 99% of Russians than it was in\n1991.\n\nRussian bonds, Inverted yield curves to tame inflation during their wars\n(Russo-Georgian War, Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian invasion of Ukraine)\n\n20-year bond\n\n10-year bond\n\n1-year bond\n\n3-month bond\n\nThe Russian economy risked going into recession from early 2014, mainly due to\nfalling oil prices, sanctions, and the subsequent capital flight. While in\n2014 GDP growth remained positive at 0.6%, in 2015 the Russian economy shrunk\nby 3.7% and was expected to shrink further in 2016. By 2016, the Russian\neconomy rebounded with 0.3% GDP growth and officially exited recession. The\ngrowth continued in 2017, with an increase of 1.5%.\n\nIn January 2016, Bloomberg rated Russia's economy as the 12th most innovative\nin the world, up from 14th in January 2015 and 18th in January 2014. Russia\nhas the world's 15th highest patent application rate, the 8th highest\nconcentration of high-tech public companies, such as internet and aerospace\nand the third highest graduation rate of scientists and engineers.\n\nAccording to the British company BP (Statistical Yearbook 2018), proven oil\nreserves in Russia at the end of 2017 were 14.5 billion tonnes (14.3 billion\nlong tons; 16.0 billion short tons), natural gas was 35 trillion cubic metres\n(1.2 quadrillion cubic feet). Gold reserves in Russia's subsoil, according to\nthe U.S. Geological Survey, were 5,500 tonnes (5,400 long tons; 6,100 short\ntons) at the end of 2017.\n\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Natural Resources estimated the country's mineral\nreserves in physical terms. At the end of 2017, oil reserves were 9.04 billion\ntonnes (8.90 billion long tons; 9.96 billion short tons), gas reserves were\n14.47 trillion cubic metres (511 trillion cubic feet), gold reserves were\n1,407 tonnes (1,385 long tons; 1,551 short tons), and diamonds reserves were\n375 million carats (75 tonnes). Then for the first time the Ministry evaluated\nthe mineral reserves of Russia in terms of value. The value of oil reserves\namounted to 39.6 trillion rubles, the value of gas amounted to 11.3 trillion\nrubles, coking coal amounted to almost 2 trillion rubles, iron ore amounted to\n808 billion rubles, diamonds amounted to 505 billion rubles, gold amounted to\n480 billion rubles. The combined value of all mineral and energy resources\n(oil, gas, gold, copper, iron ore, thermal and lignite coal, and diamonds)\namounted to 55.24 trillion rubles (US$844 billion), or 60% of GDP for 2017.\nThe assessment occurred after the adoption of a new classification of reserves\nin Russia and the object of the methodology was only those fields for which a\nlicense was issued, so the assessment of the Ministry of Natural Resources is\nless than the total volume of explored reserves. Experts criticized such \"an\nunsuccessful attempt to estimate reserves,\" pointing out that \"one should not\ntake such an estimate seriously\" and \"the form contains an incorrect formula\nfor calculating the value\".\n\nIn the International Comparison Program 2021, the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates (CIS) region was linked through the standard global core list approach,\nunlike in ICP 2017. Based on the results, the World Bank announced that in\n2021 Russia was the 4th largest economy in the world ($5.7 trillion and 3.8\npercent of the world) and the largest economy in Europe and Central Asia when\nmeasured in PPP terms."

Sanctions, boycotts and disruption of supply chains in 2022 led\nto a drop of import from 20.7% (top-15) to 15.6% (top-5).\n\nIn 2022, heavy sanctions were enacted due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nwhich will likely result in a steep recession. Since early 2022, many official\neconomic statistics have not been published. Sanctions also included asset\nfreezes on the Russian Central Bank, which holds $630 billion in foreign-\nexchange reserves, to prevent it from offsetting the effects of sanctions.\n\nAccording to most estimates, every day of the war in Ukraine costs Russia $500\nmillion to $1 billion.\n\nOn 27 June 2022, Russia defaulted on part of its foreign currency, its first\nsuch default since 1918.\n\nIn November 2022, it was reported that Russia had officially entered a\nrecession as the Federal State Statistics Service had reported a national GDP\nloss for the second consecutive quarter.\n\nAs part of the sanctions imposed on Russia, on 2 September 2022, the finance\nministers of the G7 group agreed to cap the price of Russian oil and petroleum\nproducts, designed to allow Russia to maintain production, but limiting\nrevenue from oil sales.\n\nIn 2022, _The Economist_ calculated that Russia did graduate into the category\nof high-income economies by 2022, if counted at purchasing power parity rather\nthan the exchange rate but could fall below the threshold due to the invasion\nof Ukraine. In December 2022, a study at Bank of Russia's Research and\nForecasting Department, found that the import dependence of the Russian\neconomy is relatively low, does not exceed the median for other countries, and\nthe share of imports in most industries is lower than in other countries. The\nkey explanation for this could be the low involvement of the Russian economy\nin global value supply chains and its focus on production of raw materials.\nHowever, 60% of Russia's imports come from the countries that have announced\nsanctions against Russia.\n\nTASS reported poor results for the Russian economy the first quarter of 2023\nwith revenue of 5.7 trillion roubles – down 21% (mainly due to falling oil\nrevenue), expenditure 8.1 trillion roubles – up 34% (mainly due to increased\nmilitary costs), creating a deficit 2.4 trillion roubles – ($29.4 billion)\n\nFollowing Central Bank of Russia interventions, the exchange rate of the\nrouble against the dollar remained relatively stable in 2022, although in 2023\nit started to decrease significantly, reaching RUB 97 per USD 1 on 15 August\n2023. Both the interventions and the exchange rate decrease resulted in\nsignificant criticism of the Central Bank by Russian state propaganda. Quarter\n2 of 2023 saw a 13% fall in the value of the rouble against the dollar and a\ncurrent account surplus estimated in to be falling by 80% from the annual 2022\nsurplus of $233 billion.\n\nAfter 11 years of negotiations, on 8 June 2023, in Sochi, Armenia, Belarus,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan signed the\nCommonwealth of Independent States Agreement on Free Trade in Services,\nEstablishment, Operations and Investment to partly integrate Uzbekistan and\nTajikistan on the common standards of the WTO (General Agreement on Trade in\nServices) and the EAEU (some provisions were borrowed from EAEU law) even\nwithout their membership in the WTO (Uzbekistan) or the EAEU (Uzbekistan and\nTajikistan). The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union has preserved\ninternational agreements on trade in services in the sphere of national\ncompetence of the member states therefore, the EAEU is not a party to the\nagreement.\n\nIn August and September 2023, the Central Bank of Russia started raising the\nkey lending rate, ending up at 13% in September, while USD to RUB exchange\nrate remained at RUB 95. As of June 2023 share of Russia's exports to EU\ndropped to 1.7% while Russia's imports from EU dropped to 1.5%. In October\n2023 the \"psychological barrier\" of RUB 100 per USD 1 was crossed. In July\n2024 the Russian Central Bank raised the key interest rate to 18%.\n\nThe 2024 budget expects revenues of 35 trillion rubles ($349 billion) with\nexpenditure of 36.6 trillion, based on a Urals oil forecast of $71.30 per\nbarrel, a 90.1 rubles to USD 1 exchange rate and inflation of 4.5%. Defence\nspending will double to 10.78 trillion, 29.4% of expenditure. Russia currently\nhas a record low unemployment rate of just 3 percent, due to a demographic\ndecline, demands of the war for industrial and military manpower, and large\nscale emigration.\n\nIn January 2025, it was reported that Russia had used a two-prong strategy to\nfinance the large costs of the Russo-Ukrainian war since early 2022. In\naddition to the official Russian government defense budget —direct financial\nexpenditure for waging the war was estimated at US$250 billion through June\n2024, rising to over 20% of annual GDP—an off-budget financing mechanism was\nemployed to fund the war with over US$200 billion from preferential bank loans\nmade to defence contractors and war-related businesses, loans compelled by the\nRussian government.\n\nRussian economy had a significant expansion in 2023, because it is crowded out\nby defense spending. This became an inflationary output gap, which lead to a\nstagnation, and became a recession in 2025. Until 2026 Russian economy is\nexpected to have a stagnation, because of the shrinking of the output gap,\nwith the risk of a stagflation still remaining.\n\n* Gross domestic product (PPP) per capita in April 2022\n\n* Unemployment rate of Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union\n\n* Russian inflation rate 2012–2022"

The\ncurrency in the Russian Federation is the ruble. Monetary emission is carried\nout exclusively by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (the Bank of\nRussia). The introduction and emission of other money in the Russian\nFederation is not allowed. The protection and ensuring the stability of the\nruble is the main function of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation,\nwhich it carries out independently of other government bodies. On 1 September\n2013, the Bank of Russia also became a regulator of financial markets,\napplying the integrated model of financial sector supervision.\n\nThe Central Bank of the Russian Federation follows inflation targeting policy.\nHigher inflation than in developed countries has remained throughout the last\n25–30 post-Soviet years and the devaluation of the currency (in relation to\nforeign currencies and in relation to domestic goods) is significantly\ncompensated by higher interest rates and an increase in nominal incomes and\nassets. This situation is typical for developing markets. Typically\ndevaluations of the ruble relative to foreign currency strongly stimulate the\nexport-oriented economy of Russia."

Already under the new head of the\nCentral Bank of the Russian Federation, Elvira Nabiullina, it was planned to\ncomplete the transition to a floating exchange rate regime from 1 January\n2015. The Bank of Russia dismantled the currency corridor two months earlier -\non 10 November 2014, so as not to waste gold and foreign exchange reserves. A\n2025 study said that an important constraint on the economy was “Russia’s\ndependence on hard currencies like the dollar and the euro, with only partial\n“yuanization” of its foreign trade transactions”.\n\nRuble's Real Effective Exchange Rate remained in 2022–24 higher and stronger\nthan in 1994 and 1998 when the sharp devaluations happened relative to the\nforeign currency."

    "text": "According to a 2011 research article, the nature of the relationship between\nthe centre and the regions in Russia today corresponds to the so-called\n\"centre-periphery\" model; excessive centralisation, the absence of alternative\n(to Moscow) centres in the country's territorial structure and weak horizontal\nlinks are stable characteristics of the Russian political and economic space\nand are constantly reproduced over time.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Professor Natalia Zubarevich proposed an extension of\nthe centre-periphery model and is known as the author of the \"theory of four\nRussias\". According to Zubarevich, the different speed of social modernisation\nis more accurately explained by the centre-periphery model. The entire\npopulation of the country can be divided into three roughly equal parts -\nabout a third of citizens in each. The underdeveloped republics, where 6% of\nthe country's population lives - this \"fourth\" Russia has its own specific\nfeatures. According to the concept, \"First Russia\" is the cities with millions\nof inhabitants, i.e. the most modernised and economically developed\nterritories. \"Second Russia\" are medium-sized cities with a pronounced\nindustrial profile. \"Third Russia\" - small towns, workers' settlements, rural\nareas. Compared to \"first\" and \"second Russia\" - this is a deep periphery in\nterms of the quality of socio-economic life. The \"fourth Russia\" is made up of\nthe national republics of the Caucasus, as well as the south of Siberia (Tuva,\nthe Altai Republic). These territories also represent a periphery, but a\nspecific one: the demographic transition has not been completed here,\nurbanisation is in its infancy, and patriarchal-clan principles are still\nstrong in society.\n\nMonoprofile towns (monotowns) are the most unstable part of the \"second\nRussia\"."

    "text": "Until 2022, Russia was a key oil and gas supplier to much of Europe. Rosneft\nheadquarters on the bank of the Moskva River, Moscow\n\nThe mineral-packed Ural Mountains and the vast fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal),\nand timber reserves of Siberia and the Russian Far East make Russia rich in\nnatural resources, which dominate Russian exports. Oil and gas exports,\nspecifically, continue to be the main source of hard currency.\n\nRussia has been widely described as an energy superpower; as it has the\nworld's largest natural gas reserves, the second-largest coal reserves, the\neighth-largest oil reserves, and the largest oil shale reserves in Europe. It\nis the world's leading natural gas exporter, the second-largest natural gas\nproducer, the second-largest oil exporter and producer, and the third largest\ncoal exporter. Fossil fuels cause most of the greenhouse gas emissions by\nRussia. The country is the world's fourth-largest electricity producer, and\nthe ninth-largest renewable energy producer in 2019. Russia was also the\nworld's first country to develop civilian nuclear power, and built the world's\nfirst nuclear power plant. In 2019, It was the world's fourth-largest nuclear\nenergy producer. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian state\nnuclear conglomerate Rosatom became the dominant actor in international\nnuclear power markets, training experts, constructing nuclear power plants,\nsupplying fuel and taking care of spent fuel in around the world. Whereas oil\nand gas were subject to international sanctions after Russia's full-scale\ninvasion of Ukraine in February 2023, its nuclear industry was not targeted by\nsanctions.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the share of the oil and gas sector in GDP was around 20%,\nand in 2013 it was 20–21% of GDP. The share of oil and gas in Russia's exports\n(about 50%) and federal budget revenues (about 50%) is large, and the dynamics\nof Russia's GDP are highly dependent on oil and gas prices, but the share in\nGDP is much less than 50%. According to the first such comprehensive\nassessment published by the Russian statistics agency Rosstat in 2021, the\nmaximum total share of the oil and gas sector in Russia's GDP, including\nextraction, refining, transport, sale of oil and gas, all goods and services\nused, and all supporting activities, amounts to 16.9% in 2017, 21.1% in 2018,\n19.2% in 2019 and 15.2% in 2020. To compare the data obtained using the same\nmethodology, the source provides data for other countries. This is more than\nthe share of GDP in the United States (8%) and Canada (less 10%). This is\ncomparable to the share of GDP in Norway (14%) and Kazakhstan (13.3%). It is\nmuch lower than the share of GDP in the United Arab Emirates (30%) and Saudi\nArabia (50%). This assessment did not include, for example, the production of\nused pumps or specialized education, which should have been included,\naccording to experts. Russia consumes domestically two-thirds of its gas\nproduction and a quarter of its oil production while it sells three-quarters\nof its oil on the world market and Russia's share of the traded world oil\nmarket is 17.5% - more than Saudi Arabia's. At the same time, experts note\nthat there are formal and informal part of the rent and the total oil and gas\nrent in 2023 can be estimated at 24% of Russia's GDP. Michael Alexeyev (son of\nLyudmila Alexeyeva), a professor of economics at Indiana University, notes\nthat the oil and gas taxes reported by the government do not include corporate\ndividends and the so-called indirect or additional revenues derived from the\nexpenditure of oil and gas rents in the economy. There is also such an\nindicator as the oil rent (% of GDP), which is published by the World Bank. It\nis 9.7% for Russia, 14.8% for Kazakhstan, 6.1% for Norway, 23.7% for Saudi\nArabia, 15.7% for the United Arab Emirates, 2.8% for Canada and 0.6% for the\nUnited States.\n\n2023 saw a fall in Russia's oil and gas tax revenues of 24% to 8.8 trillion\nroubles ($99.4 billion) compared to 2022."

It has\nthe world's third-largest cultivated area, at 1,265,267 square kilometres\n(488,522 sq mi). However, due to the harshness of its environment, about 13.1%\nof its land is agricultural, and only 7.4% of its land is arable. The main\nproduct of Russian farming has always been grain, which occupies considerably\nmore than half of the cropland. Russia is the world's largest exporter of\nwheat, and is the largest producer of barley, buckwheat, oats, and rye, and\nthe second-largest producer of sunflower seed. Various analysts of climate\nchange adaptation foresee large opportunities for Russian agriculture during\nthe rest of the 21st century as arability increases in Siberia, which would\nlead to both internal and external migration to the region.\n\nMore than one-third of the sown area is devoted to fodder crops, and the\nremaining farmland is devoted to industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits.\nOwing to its large coastline along three oceans, Russia maintains one of the\nworld's largest fishing fleets, ranking sixth in the world in tonnage of fish\ncaught; capturing 4.77 million tonnes (4.69 million long tons; 5.26 million\nshort tons) of fish in 2018. It is also home to the world's finest caviar (the\nbeluga), and produces about one-third of all canned fish, and some one-fourth\nof the world's total fresh and frozen fish."
