Of that 12%, 10% was in Freetown, and the remaining 90% of the\ncountry used 2% of the nation's electricity. The majority of the population\nrelies on biomass fuels, with firewood and coal used most prevalently. The\nburning of these sources has been reported to have adverse health effects on\nwomen and children. The use of coal and firewood has also posed environmental\nconcerns as they are both in conflict with the push for more sustainable\nsources of energy. As a result, the commercialisation of firewood and coal has\nbeen a point of contention with aid donors and government agencies. There have\nbeen strong pushes for both solar and hydropower to become the dominant\nsources of energy. Sierra Leone's tropical climate, heavy annual rainfall, and\nabundance of rivers give it the potential to pursue more solar and hydropower\nalternatives.\n\nIn conjunction with the UK's Department for International Development (DFID),\nSierra Leone has set a goal to provide solar power to all its citizens by\n2025. It aims provide solar power to at least 50,000 homes in 2016, 250,000\nhomes by 2017, and 1,000,000 people by 2020. This initiative falls under the\nEnergy Africa access campaign. Before this compact agreement, Sierra Leone's\nprivate sector for solar energy was weak, as it provided energy to less than\n5% of the target population. Part of the reason for this was the import\nduties, taxes, and lack of quality control. To ensure that the Energy Africa\ngoal is met, Sierra Leone has agreed to remove its import duties and Value\nAdded Tax (VAT) on certified solar products. It is estimated that there will\nbe a 30% to 40% cost reduction on solar products with the lack of duties and\ntaxes.\n\nAs of 2012, Sierra Leone has three main hydroelectric plants: the Guma plant,\nwhich was decommissioned in 1982; the Dodo Plant, in the Eastern Province; and\nthe Bumbuna plant. There is also potential for several new hydroelectric\nplants to open on the Sewa River, Pampana River, Seli River, Moa River, and\nLittle Scarcies. The Bumbuna dam is the largest and was estimated to produce\nabout 50 megawatts of electricity. It has been projected that the Bumbuna dam\ncould reduce the amount of spending on foreign fuel and save the country at\nleast $2 million a month.",

Though rich in this\nresource, the country has historically struggled to manage its exploitation\nand export. Annual production estimates range between $70–$250 million;\nhowever, only a fraction of that passes through formal export channels (1999:\n$1.2 million; 2000: $16 million; 2001: projections $25 million). The balance\nis smuggled out and has been used to finance rebel activities in the region,\nmoney laundering, arms purchases, and financing of other illicit activities,\nleading some to characterize Sierra Leone's diamonds as a \"conflict resource.\"\n\nRecent efforts on the part of the country to improve the management of the\nexport trade have met with some success. In October 2000, a new UN-approved\nexport certification system for exporting diamonds from Sierra Leone was put\ninto place that led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the\nGovernment of Sierra Leone created a mining community development fund, which\nreturns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The\nfund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.\n\nSierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of rutile, a titanium ore\nused as paint pigment and welding rod coatings. Sierra Rutile Limited, fully\nowned by Nord Resources of the United States, began commercial mining\noperations near Bonthe in early 1979. Sierra Rutile was then the largest non-\npetroleum U.S. investment in West Africa. The export of 88,000 tons realized\n$75 million for the country in 1990.\n\nThe company and the Government of Sierra Leone concluded a new agreement on\nthe terms of the company's concession in Sierra Leone in 1990. Rutile and\nbauxite mining operations were suspended when rebels invaded the mining sites\nin 1995. Negotiations for reactivation of rutile and bauxite mining are in\nprogress. The U.S. interest in the company has been reduced to 25%.\n\nSince independence, the Government of Sierra Leone has encouraged foreign\ninvestment, although the business climate suffers from uncertainty and a\nshortage of foreign exchange because of civil conflicts. Investors are\nprotected by an agreement that allows for arbitration under the 1965 World\nBank Convention. Legislation provides for transfer of interest, dividends, and\ncapital.",
