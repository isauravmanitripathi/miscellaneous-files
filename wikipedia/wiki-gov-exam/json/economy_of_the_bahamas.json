Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in\nconstruction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP\ngrowth for many years. The slowdown in the Economy of the United States and\nthe September 11 attacks held back growth in these sectors from 2001 to 2003.\n\nFinancial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian\neconomy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when\nthe government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many\ninternational businesses have left the Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture\ntogether contribute approximately 10% of GDP and show little growth, despite\ngovernment incentives for those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short\nrun rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on\ngrowth in the United States, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In\naddition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a\n\"2nd-pillar\", e-commerce."

    "text": "The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial\nservices to generate foreign exchange earnings. The Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) of the Bahamas is approximately $5.7 billion with tourism accounting for\n50%, financial services nearly 20% and the balance spread among retail and\nwholesale trade, fishing, light manufacturing and agriculture. The European\nUnion lists the Bahamas as one of several Caribbean \"uncooperative\njurisdictions\" because it fails to meet tax fairness and transparency\nbenchmarks."

    "text": "Tourism alone provides an estimated 51% of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nand employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2016, over 3 million\ntourists visited the Bahamas, most of whom are from the United States and\nCanada.\n\nA major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is\nKerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former\nParadise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In\naddition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this\nturnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to\ncourting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the\nFar East, Europe, Latin America, and Canada. The primary purpose of the trips\nwas to restore the reputation of the Bahamas in these markets."

As of December 1998, 418 banks and trust companies\nhave been licensed in the Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International\nBusiness Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status\nas a leading financial center. The Act simplified and reduced the cost of\nincorporating offshore companies in the Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than\n100,000 IBC-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the\ngovernment also legalized the establishment of Asset Protection Trusts in the\nBahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary FATF\nBlacklist, the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the\nfinancial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and\nenforcement of \"know-your-customer\" rules. Other initiatives include the\nenactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of\nlegislation to regulate Private Trust Companies. After being later off the\nblacklist, in December 2020 Bahamas also was taken off the FATF greylist."

The Bahamas\nexports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially.\nThere is no large scale agriculture, and most agricultural products are\nconsumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in\nfoodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The\ngovernment aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate\nforeign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing\nagricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government\nofficially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts,\ndairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the\nareas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment."

    "text": "The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical\nfirm, PharmaChem Technologies (GrandBahama) Ltd. (formerly Syntex); the BORCO\noil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the\nCommonwealth Brewery in Nassau, which produces Heineken, Guinness, and Kalik\nbeers; and Bacardi Corp., which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the\nU.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in\nGreat Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and\nmining of aragonite—a type of limestone with several industrial uses—from the\nsea floor at Ocean Cay. Other smaller but more nimble players in the banking\nindustry include Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) Ltd. (FBB) and Royal Fidelity\nMerchant Bank & Trust Limited (RFMBT). FBB offers a wide range of innovative\nbanking products including loan products with built-in savings plans. RFMBT is\nthe only merchant bank in the Bahamas and is a joint venture with Royal Bank\nof Canada. It provides investment products and services and attracts the\nmajority of the corporate business deals in the Bahamas, most recently acting\nas financial advisor and placement agent for the largest initial public\noffering (IPO) ever in the Bahamas with the IPO of Commonwealth Brewery, a\nHeineken subsidiary.\n\nThe Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, the\nBahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage\nforeign industrial investment. The Hong Kong-based firm, Hutchison Whampoa,\nhas opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved\nlegislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions\nthrough 2054."
