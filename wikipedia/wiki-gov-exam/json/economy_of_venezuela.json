    "text": "| This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( April 2023)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy of Venezuela** is based primarily on petroleum, as the country\nholds the largest crude oil supply in the world. Venezuela was historically\namong the wealthiest economies in South America, particularly from the 1950s\nto 1980s. During the 21st century, under the leadership of socialist populist\nHugo Chávez and his successor Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan economy has\ncollapsed, prompting millions of citizens to flee Venezuela. GDP has fallen by\n80 percent in less than a decade. The economy is characterized by corruption,\nfood shortages, unemployment, mismanagement of the oil sector, and since 2014,\nhyperinflation. As of 2024, inflation has stabilized at 59.61%.\n\nVenezuela is the 25th largest producer of oil in the world and the 8th largest\nmember of OPEC. Venezuela also manufactures and exports heavy industry\nproducts such as steel, aluminum, and cement. Other notable manufacturing\nincludes electronics and automobiles as well as beverages and foodstuffs.\nAgriculture in Venezuela accounts for approximately 4.7% of GDP, 7.3% of the\nlabor force and at least one-fourth of Venezuela's land area. Venezuela\nexports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, pork and beef. Venezuela has\nan estimated US$14.3 trillion worth of natural resources and is not self-\nsufficient in most areas of agriculture. Exports accounted for 16.7% of GDP\nand petroleum products accounted for about 95% of those exports.\n\nSince the 1920s, Venezuela has been a rentier state, offering oil as its main\nexport. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the Venezuelan economy experienced\na steady growth that attracted many immigrants, with the nation enjoying the\nhighest standard of living in Latin America. The situation reversed when oil\nprices collapsed during the 1980s. Hugo Chavez became president in 1999 and\nimplemented a form of socialism (the Bolivarian Revolution) that resulted in\nthe collapse or nationalization of many Venezuelan businesses, and purged the\nstate-run PDVSA oil company, replacing thousands of workers with political\nsupporters with no technical expertise. The Chavez administration also imposed\nstringent currency controls in 2003 in an attempt to prevent capital flight.\nThese actions resulted in a decline in oil production and exports and a series\nof stern currency devaluations.\n\nPrice controls and expropriation of numerous farmlands and various industries\nare government policies along with a near-total freeze on any access to\nforeign currency at reasonable \"official\" exchange rates. These have resulted\nin severe shortages in Venezuela and steep price rises of all common goods,\nincluding food, water, household products, spare parts, tools and medical\nsupplies; forcing many manufacturers to either cut production or close down,\nwith many ultimately abandoning the country as has been the case with several\ntechnological firms and most automobile makers.\n\nVenezuela's economy has been in a state of total economic collapse since 2013.\nIn 2015, Venezuela had over 100% inflation—the highest in the world and the\nhighest in the country's history at that time. According to independent\nsources, the rate increased to 80,000% at the end of 2018 with Venezuela\nspiraling into hyperinflation while the poverty rate was nearly 90 percent of\nthe population. On 14 November 2017, credit rating agencies declared that\nVenezuela was in default with its debt payments, with Standard & Poor's\ncategorizing Venezuela as being in \"selective default\".\n\nThe United States has been Venezuela's most important trading partner despite\nthe strained relations between the two countries. American exports to\nVenezuela have included machinery, agricultural products, medical instruments\nand cars. Venezuela is one of the top four suppliers of foreign oil to the\nUnited States. About 500 American companies are represented in Venezuela.\nAccording to the Central Bank of Venezuela, between 1998 and 2008 the\ngovernment received around US$325 billion through oil production and exports\nin general.[17] According to the International Energy Agency (as of August\n2015), the production of 2.4 million barrels per day supplied 500,000 barrels\nto the United States.[18] A report published by Transparencia Venezuela in\n2022 estimated that illegal activities in the country made up around 21% of\nits GDP."

    "text": "> Almost 82% of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty,\n> unable to buy even basic foodstuffs.\n>\n> – A UN special reporter said in February 2024 after visiting the country.\n\nVenezuela was “once among South America's wealthiest countries” before the\neconomic meltdown under Maduro regime.\n\n“The formerly rich petro-state has seen GDP fall by 80% in less than a decade,\ndriving some seven million of its citizens to flee. Most Venezuelans live on\njust a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in\ntotal disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel” as of 2024,\naccording to VOA (report from AFP).\n\nA report published by Transparencia Venezuela in 2022 estimated that illegal\nactivities in the country made up around 21% of its GDP. According to the\nreport, drug, oil and gold trafficking, as well as illegal activities in ports\nand customs had generated over 9.4 billion dollars for organized crime\nprotected by corrupt officials. In 2021, gold extraction generated around 2.3\nbillion dollars, of which the State received only 25%.\n\nBy 2023, the economic situation of Venezuela improved, with the economy\ngrowing by 15% and extreme poverty rates decreasing, thanks to a liberalized\neconomy and more access to the United States dollar. However, inequality is\nhigh, with wealthy Venezuelans making more than 70 times the poorest ones. In\n2024 inflation cooled to 1.7% monthly after injection of Chevron dollars—the\nlowest in a decade."

    "text": "After oil was discovered in Venezuela in 1922 during the Maracaibo strike,\nVenezuela's dictator Juan Vicente Gómez allowed American oil companies to\nwrite Venezuela's petroleum law. In 1943, Standard Oil of New Jersey accepted\na new agreement in Venezuela based on the 50–50 principle, described as \"a\nlandmark event\". Even more favorable terms were negotiated in 1945, after a\ncoup brought to power a left-leaning government that included Juan Pablo Pérez\nAlfonso.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1980s, the Venezuelan economy, which was buoyed by\nhigh oil prices, was one of the strongest and most prosperous in South\nAmerica. The continuous growth during that period attracted many immigrants.\n\nIn 1958, a new government, again including Pérez Alfonso, devised a plan for\nan international oil cartel, that would become OPEC.\n\nDuring Pérez Jiménez' dictatorship from 1952 to 1958, Venezuela enjoyed\nremarkably high GDP growth, so that in the late 1950s Venezuela's real GDP per\ncapita almost reached that of Ireland or West Germany. Albeit, West Germany\nwas still recovering from WW2 destruction of German infrastructure. In 1950,\nVenezuela was the world's 4th wealthiest nation per capita. However, Rómulo\nBetancourt, president from 1959 to 1964, inherited from 1958 to 1959 onward an\nenormous internal and external debt caused by rampant public spending. He\nmanaged to balance Venezuela's public budget and initiate an agrarian reform."

    "text": "Buoyed by a strong oil sector in the 1960s and 1970s, Venezuela's governments\nwere able to maintain social harmony by spending fairly large amounts on\npublic programs including health care, education, transport and food\nsubsidies. Literacy and welfare programs benefited tremendously from these\nconditions. The first tenure of Carlos Andrés Pérez from 1974 to 1979\nbenefited from the 1970s energy crisis, tripling the amount of public spending\nand nationalizing the oil industry, establishing PDVSA. He also increased\ngovernment debt significantly, nationalized the iron industry, created new\nstate-owned companies, nationalized the central bank and replaced its board\nwith cabinet members, eliminating the bank's independence as a result. His\ngovernment was also allowed to establish the first minimum wage and salary\nincreases with an enabling act approved by the National Congress. Pérez was\naccused of excessive and disorderly public spending. Venezuela's external debt\ngrew from $2 billion in 1972 to $33 billion by 1982.\n\nVenezuela's economic situation was reversed when oil prices collapsed during\nthe 1980s. Luis Herrera Campins was elected just as the oil prices collapsed,\nwith the economy experiencing turmoil throughout his tenure. The economy\ncontracted and inflation levels (consumer price inflation) rose, remaining\nbetween 6 and 12% from 1982 to 1986. Policies implemented by Herrera to reduce\ninflation and reverse increased government spending were not effective,\nresulting with the election of Jaime Lusinchi in the 1983 Venezuelan general\nelection. The Lusinchi administration continued strict foreign exchange\ncontrols and excessive spending while oil prices continued to decrease.\nLusinchi focused the nation's funds on paying foreign debtors, sending $15\nbillion out to international lenders from 1985 to 1988 to tend the remaining\n$32 billion of debt. By the end of his presidency, the public began to suffer\nfrom inflated prices and shortages of basic goods.\n\nPeople looting stores during the Caracazo in 1989\n\nCarlos Andrés Pérez based his campaign for the 1988 Venezuelan general\nelection in his legacy of abundance during his first presidential period and\ninitially rejected liberalization policies. Venezuela's international reserves\nwere only US$300 million at the time of Pérez' election into the presidency;\nPérez decided to respond to the debt, public spending, economic restrictions\nand rentier state by liberalizing the economy. He announced a technocratic\ncabinet and a group of economic policies to fix macroeconomic imbalances known\nas _El Gran Viraje [es]_ (English: The Great Turn), called by detractors as\n_El Paquetazo Económico_ (English: The Economic Package). Among the policies\nthere was the reduction of fuel subsidies and the increase of public\ntransportation fares by thirty percent (VEB 16 Venezuelan bolívares, or\nUS$0.4). The increase was supposed to be implemented on 1 March 1989, but bus\ndrivers decided to apply the price rise on 27 February, a day before payday in\nVenezuela. In response, protests and rioting began on the morning of 27\nFebruary 1989 in Guarenas, a town near Caracas; a lack of timely intervention\nby authorities, as the Caracas Metropolitan Police [es] was on a labor strike,\nled to the protests and rioting quickly spreading to the capital and other\ntowns across the country.\n\nCANTV's old logo, state telecommunications company privatized in 1991.\n\nBy late 1991, as part of the economic reforms, Carlos Andrés Pérez'\nadministration had sold three banks, a shipyard, two sugar mills, an airline,\na telephone company and a cell phone band, receiving a total of US$2,287\nmillion. The most remarkable auction was CANTV's, a telecommunications\ncompany, which was sold at the price of US$1,885 million to the consortium\ncomposed of American AT&T International, General Telephone Electronic and the\nVenezuelan Electricidad de Caracas and Banco Mercantil. The privatization\nended Venezuela's monopoly over telecommunications and surpassed even the most\noptimistic predictions, with over US$1,000 million above the base price and\nUS$500 million more than the bid offered by the competition group. By the end\nof the year, inflation had dropped from 84% in 1989 to 31%, Venezuela's\ninternational reserves were now worth US$14,000 million and there was an\neconomic growth of 9% (called as an \"Asian growth\"), the largest in Latin\nAmerica at the time. While foreign debtors were repaid and the economy grew,\nby 1992, the majority of economic benefits were experienced by the upper class\nwhile middle to lower classes faced increased poverty and high unemployment\nrates between ten and forty percent.[_verification needed_][_verification\nneeded_][_verification needed_]\n\nOverreliance on oil exports and a fractured political system without parties\nagreeing on policies caused many of the problems. By the mid-1990s, Venezuela\nunder President Rafael Caldera saw annual inflation rates of 50–60% from 1993\nto 1997, with the country suffering a banking crisis. In 1998, the economic\ncrisis had grown even worse. Per capita GDP was at the same level as 1963\n(after adjusting 1963 dollar to 1998 value), down a third from its 1978 peak;\nand the purchasing power of the average salary was a third of its 1978 level."

    "text": "Hugo Chávez was elected President in December 1998 and took office in February\n1999. From 1999 to the end of 2012, when Hugo Chavez health decayed preventing\nhim from fulfilling any presidential duties, the GDP grew from 97.52 billion\ndollars to 372.59 billion dollars. In the same period, inflation remained\nstable around 20% year.\n\nFrom 1999 In 2000, oil prices soared, offering Chávez funds not seen since\nVenezuela's economic collapse in the 1980s. Chávez implemented economic\npolicies that leaned toward social democracy, utilizing oil revenues to fund\nsocial programs. These policies increased Venezuela's economic reliance on\nhigh oil prices.\n\nDuring the first four years of Chávez's presidency, the economy initially grew\nbetween 1999 and 2001 but contracted from 2001 to 2003, returning to GDP\nlevels similar to those of 1997. The early decline was influenced by low oil\nprices and later exacerbated by the events surrounding the 2002 coup attempt\nand the 2002–2003 general strike. Additional contributing factors included\ncapital flight and reduced foreign investment. GDP decreased from 50.0\ntrillion bolívares in 1998 to 42.4 trillion bolívares in 2003 (measured in\nconstant 1998 bolívares).\n\nThe hardest-hit sectors in the worst recession years (2002–2003) were\nconstruction (−55.9%), petroleum (−26.5%), commerce (−23.6%) and manufacturing\n(−22.5%). The drop in the petroleum sector was caused by adherence to the OPEC\nquota established in 2002 and the virtual cessation of exports during the\nPdVSA-led general strike of 2002–2003. The non-petroleum sector of the economy\ncontracted by 6.5% in 2002. The bolívar, which had been suffering from serious\ninflation and devaluation relative to international standards since the late\n1980s, stabilized around 20% inflation.\n\nDuring Chávez's presidency, inflation was significantly reduced and maintained\nat an average of around 20%, marking a substantial improvement compared to the\nlate 1980s and the turbulent 1990s, when inflation reached its highest point\nat 100% in 1996. The inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index,\nstood at 35.8% in 1998, dropped to a low of 12.5% in 2001, and rose to 31.1%\nin 2003. In response to pressures on the bolívar, declining international\nreserves, and the economic impact of the oil industry work stoppage, the\nMinistry of Finance and the central bank suspended foreign exchange trading on\nJanuary 23, 2003. Shortly afterward, the government established CADIVI, a\ncurrency control board, on February 6, 2003. CADIVI regulated foreign exchange\nprocedures and set the exchange rate at 1,596 bolívares per US dollar for\npurchases and 1,600 bolívares per US dollar for sales.\n\nThe housing market in Venezuela shrunk significantly with developers avoiding\nVenezuela due to the massive number of companies who have had their property\nexpropriated by the government. According to The Heritage Foundation and _The\nWall Street Journal_ , Venezuela had the weakest property rights in the world,\nscoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100, with expropriation without compensation\nbeing common. The housing shortage in Venezuela was significant enough that,\nin 2007, a group of squatters occupied the Centro Financiero Confinanzas, an\nunfinished economic complex originally intended to represent the country's\neconomic growth.\n\nThe Venezuelan economy contracted by 5.8% in the first quarter of 2010\ncompared to the same period in 2009 and recorded the highest inflation rate in\nLatin America at 30.5%. President Chávez expressed optimism about Venezuela's\nrecovery, although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that\nVenezuela would be the only country in the region to remain in recession that\nyear. The IMF described Venezuela's economic recovery as \"delayed and weak\"\ncompared to other countries in the region.\n\nNevertheless, the Venezuelan economy resumed a growth trend in subsequent\nyears, continuing until 2012. The economic downturn began during Nicolás\nMaduro's leadership, as Chávez’s health declined and he became increasingly\nunable to govern effectively."

    "text": "Shortages in Venezuela leave store shelves empty\n\nAccording to the misery index in 2013, Venezuela ranked as the top spot\nglobally with the highest misery index score. The International Finance\nCorporation ranked Venezuela one of the lowest countries for doing business\nwith, ranking it 180 of 185 countries for its _Doing Business 2013_ report\nwith protecting investors and taxes being its worst rankings. In early 2013,\nthe bolívar fuerte was devalued due to growing shortages in Venezuela. The\nshortages included necessities such as toilet paper, milk and flour. Shortages\nalso affected healthcare in Venezuela, with the University of Caracas Medical\nHospital ceasing to perform surgeries due to the lack of supplies in 2014. The\nBolivarian government's policies also made it difficult to import drugs and\nother medical supplies. Due to such complications, many Venezuelans died\navoidable deaths with medical professionals having to use limited resources\nusing methods that were replaced decades ago.\n\nAn opposition protester during the 2014 Venezuelan protests holding a sign\nsaying: \"I protest for the scarcity. Where can we get these?\"\n\nIn 2014, Venezuela entered an economic recession having its GDP growth decline\nto −3.0%. Venezuela was placed at the top of the misery index for the second\nyear in a row. _The Economist_ said Venezuela was \"probably the world's worst-\nmanaged economy\". Citibank believed that \"the economy has little prospect of\nimprovement\" and that the state of the Venezuelan economy was a \"disaster\".\nThe _Doing Business 2014_ report by the International Finance Corporation and\nthe World Bank ranked Venezuela one score lower than the previous year, then\n181 out of 185. The Heritage Foundation ranked Venezuela 175th out of 178\ncountries in economic freedom for 2014, classifying it as a \"repressed\"\neconomy according to the principles the foundation advocates. According to\n_Foreign Policy_ , Venezuela was ranked last in the world on its Base Yield\nIndex due to low returns that investors receive when investing in Venezuela.\nIn a 2014 report titled _Scariest Places on the Business Frontiers_ by Zurich\nFinancial Services and reported by _Bloomberg_ , Venezuela was ranked as the\nriskiest emerging market in the world. Many companies such as Toyota, Ford\nMotor Co., General Motors Company, Air Canada, Air Europa, American Airlines,\nCopa Airlines, TAME, TAP Airlines and United Airlines slowed or stopped\noperation due to the lack of hard currency in the country, with Venezuela\nowing such foreign companies billions of dollars. Venezuela also dismantled\nCADIVI, a government body in charge of currency exchange. CADIVI was known for\nholding money from the private sector and was suspected to be corrupt.\n\nVenezuelans eating from garbage in late 2015\n\nVenezuela again topped the misery index according to the World Bank in 2015.\nThe IMF predicted in October 2015 an inflation rate of 159% for the year\n2015—the highest rate in Venezuelan history and the highest rate in the\nworld—and that the economy would contract by 10%. According to leaked\ndocuments from the Central Bank of Venezuela, the country ended 2015 with an\ninflation rate of 270% and a shortage rate of goods over 70%.\n\nPresident Nicolás Maduro reorganized his economic cabinet in 2016 with the\ngroup mainly consisting of leftist Venezuelan academics. According to Bank of\nAmerica's investment division Merrill Lynch, Maduro's new cabinet was expected\nto tighten currency and price controls in the country. Alejandro Werner, the\nhead of IMF's Latin American Department, stated that 2015 figures released by\nthe Central Bank of Venezuela were not accurate and that Venezuela's inflation\nfor 2015 was 275%. Other forecast inflation figures by IMF and Bank of America\nwere 720% and 1,000% in 2016, Analysts believed that the Venezuelan government\nhas been manipulating economic statistics, especially since they did not\nreport adequate data since late 2014. According to economist Steve Hanke of\nJohns Hopkins University, the Central Bank of Venezuela delayed the release of\nstatistics and lied about figures much like the Soviet Union did, with Hanke\nsaying that a lie coefficient had to be used to observe Venezuela's economic\ndata.\n\nBy 2016, media outlets said that Venezuela was suffering an economic collapse\nwith the IMF saying that it expected it to reach a 500% inflation rate and 10%\ncontraction in the GDP. In December 2016, monthly inflation exceeded 50\npercent for the 30th consecutive day, meaning the Venezuelan economy was\nofficially experiencing hyperinflation, making it the 57th country to be added\nto the Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table.\n\nOn 25 August 2017, it was reported that new United States sanctions against\nVenezuela did not ban trading of the country's existing non-government bonds,\nwith the sanctions instead including restrictions intended to block the\ngovernment's ability to fund itself.\n\nOn 26 January 2018, the government ended the protected, subsidized fixed\nexchange rate mechanism that was highly overvalued as a result of rampant\ninflation. The National Assembly (led by the opposition) said inflation in\n2017 was over 4,000%, a level other independent economists also agreed with.\nIn February, the government launched an oil-backed cryptocurrency called the\npetro.\n\nBloomberg's Cafe Con Leche Index calculated the price increase for a cup of\ncoffee to have increased by 718% in the 12 weeks before 18 January 2018, an\nannualized inflation rate of 448,000%. The finance commission of the National\nAssembly noted in July 2018 that prices were doubling every 28 days with an\nannualized inflation rate of 25,000%.\n\nThe country was heading for a selective default in 2017. In early 2018, the\ncountry was in default, meaning it could not pay its lenders.\n\nOn 24 August 2017 President Trump imposed sanctions on the state debt of\nVenezuela which ban to make transactions with state debt of Venezuela\nincluding the participation in debt restructuring. On 13 November 2017 the\ntechnical default period ended and Venezuela did not pay coupons on its dollar\neurobonds. This caused a cross default on other dollar bonds. On 30 November\nISDA committee consisting of 15 biggest banks admitted default on state debt\nobligations what in its turn entailed payments on CDS. According to Cbonds,\nnowadays there are 20 international Venezuelan bonds which are recognized in\ndefault. The overall amount of defaulted obligations is equal to 36 billion\ndollars."

The country is a major producer of petroleum\nproducts, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. The\nInternational Energy Agency shows how Venezuela's oil production has fallen in\nthe last years, producing only 2,300,000 barrels (370,000 m3) daily, down from\n3.5 million in 1998. However, the oil incomes will double its value in local\ncurrency with the recent currency devaluation. Venezuela has large energy\nsubsidies. In 2015, the cost of petrol was just US$0.06 per gallon, costing\n23% of government revenues. In February 2016, the government finally decided\nto raise the price, but only to 6 bolívar (about 60¢ at the official rate of\nexchange) per litre for premium and just 1 bolívar (10¢) for lower-grade\npetrol.\n\nA range of other natural resources, including iron ore, coal, bauxite, gold,\nnickel and diamonds, are in various stages of development and production. In\nApril 2000, Venezuela's president decreed a new mining law and regulations\nwere adopted to encourage greater private sector participation in mineral\nextraction.

In the production of gold, until 2009 the country produced an annual\naverage between 11 and 12 tons per year. After that, due to the political and\neconomic problems, mining activity plummeted: in 2017 the country only\nextracted 0.48 ton.\n\nVenezuela mostly utilizes hydropower resources to supply power to the nation's\nindustries, accounting for 57% of total consumption at the end of 2016.\nHowever, persistent drought has severely reduced energy production from\nhydropower resources. The national electricity law is designed to provide a\nlegal framework and to encourage competition and new investment in the\nsector.[_citation needed_] After a two-year delay, the government is\nproceeding with plans to privatize the various state-owned electricity systems\nunder a different scheme than previously envisioned.[_citation needed_]"

Venezuela\nexports rice, corn, fish, tropical fruit, coffee, beef and pork. The country\nis not self-sufficient in most areas of agriculture. Venezuela imports about\ntwo-thirds of its food needs. In 2002, American firms exported $347 million\nworth of agricultural products, including wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal,\ncotton, animal fats, vegetable oils and other items to make Venezuela one of\nthe top two American markets in South America.

During times of high oil revenues\ndomestic agriculture was neglected in favor of imported products, but when oil\nrevenues fell and the currency experienced hyperinflation, the cost of\nacquiring those imported goods became prohibitive for most Venezuelans.\n\nVenezuela produced in 2019:\n\n* 4.3 million tons of sugarcane;\n* 1.9 million tons of maize;\n* 1.4 million tons of banana;\n* 760 thousand tons of rice;\n* 485 thousand tons of pineapple;\n* 477 thousand tons of potato;\n* 435 thousand tons of palm oil;\n* 421 thousand tons of cassava;\n* 382 thousand tons of orange;\n* 225 thousand tons of watermelon;\n* 199 thousand tons of papaya;\n* 194 thousand tons of melon;\n* 182 thousand tons of tomatoes;\n* 155 thousand tons of tangerine;\n* 153 thousand tons of coconut;\n* 135 thousand tons of avocado;\n* 102 thousand tons of mango (including mangosteen and guava);\n* 56 thousand tons of coffee;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products. Due to\ninternal economic and political problems, sugar cane production dropped from\n7.3 million tons in 2012 to 3.6 million in 2016. Corn production dropped from\n2.3 million tons in 2014 to 1.2 million in 2017. Rice fell from 1.15 million\ntons in 2014 to 498 thousand tons in 2016."

You can help by adding to it. _( September\n2010)_\n---|---\n\nUnder Chávez, Venezuela has also instituted worker-run \"co-management\"\ninitiatives in which workers' councils play a key role in the management of a\nplant or factory. In experimental co-managed enterprises, such as the state-\nowned Alcasa factory, workers develop budgets and elect both managers and\ndepartmental delegates who work together with company executives on technical\nissues related to production.\n\nIn November 2010, workers spent a week protesting outside factories in Valera\nand Valencia following the expropriation of the American bottle-maker Owens-\nIllinois.\n\nLabor disputes have continued to increase since the financial crisis in 2008.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, Venezuela is ranked as 134th of the 148\ncountries for economic competitiveness. Many in the private sector attribute\nthese findings to the inflexible labor market.\n\nIn recent years, a barrage of pro-worker decrees have been passed. The most\nsignificant could be the 2012 labor laws known as the LOTTT. These laws\nincluded the virtual ban on dismissal, shorter work week, improved holidays\nand enhanced maternity benefits. The LOTTT offers job security to most workers\nafter the first month. Employers have reported an absenteeism rate of up to\n40% which they blame on the leniency of these labor laws. As expected,\nemployers have been less willing to recruit.\n\nOn 17 November 2014, President Maduro issued a decree to increase the minimum\nsalary for all workers by 15%. The decree became effective on 1 December 2014.\nAs part of the May Day celebrations in honor of workers' day, President Maduro\nannounced on 28 April 2015 that the minimum wage would increase 30%; 20% in\nMay and 10% in July, with the newly announced minimum wage for Venezuelans\nbeing only about $30 per month at the widely used black market rate.\n\nIn September 2017, the National Union of Workers (UNETE) announced that\nVenezuela had lost 3,345,000 jobs since the election of President Maduro. By\nDecember 2017, the number of lost jobs increased by 400,000 to over 3,850,000\nlost jobs since the start of Maduro's tenure."

The network is being built in cooperation with China\nRailways, which is also cooperating with Venezuela to create factories for\ntracks, railway cars and eventually locomotives.

On the black market, the bolívar fell 28% in 2007 to\nBs. 4,750 per US$ and declined to around VEF 5.5 (Bs 5500) per US$ in early\n2009.\n\nThe economy recovered and grew by 16.8% in 2004. This growth occurred across a\nwide range of sectors—the oil industry directly provides only a small\npercentage of employment in the country. International reserves grew to US$27\nbillion. Polling firm Datanalysis noted that real income in the poorest\nsectors of society grew by 33% in 2004.[_citation needed_]\n\nOn 7 March 2007, the government announced that the Venezuelan bolívar would be\nredenominated at a ratio of 1 to 1,000 at the beginning of 2008 and renamed\nthe _bolívar fuerte_ (\"strong bolivar\") to ease accounting and transactions.\nThis was carried out on 1 January 2008, at which time the exchange rate was\n2.15 _bolívar fuerte_ per US$. The ISO 4217 code for the _bolívar fuerte_ is\nVEF.\n\nGovernment spending as a percentage of GDP in Venezuela in 2007 was 30%,\nsmaller than other mixed economies such as France (49%) and Sweden (52%).\nAccording to official sources from the United Nations, the percentage of\npeople below the national poverty line has decreased during the presidency of\nHugo Chávez, from 48.1% in 2002 to 28% in 2008.\n\nWith the 2007 rise in oil prices and rising government expenditures,\nVenezuela's economy grew by 9% in 2007. Oil prices fell starting in July 2008,\nresulting in a major loss of income. Hit by a global recession, the economy\ncontracted by 2% in the second quarter of 2009, contracting a further 4.5% in\nthe third quarter of 2009. Chavez's response has been that these standards\nmis-state economic fact and that the economy should be measured by socialistic\nstandards. On 17 November, the Central Bank reported that private sector\nactivity declined by 4.5% and that inflation was averaging 26.7%. Compounding\nsuch problems is a drought which the government says was caused by El Niño,\nresulting in rationing of water and electricity and a short supply of food.\n\nThe year 2010 saw Venezuela still in recession as GDP has fallen by 5.8% in\nthe first quarter of 2010. The Central Bank of Venezuela has stated that the\nrecession is due largely \"to restricted access to foreign currency for\nimports, lower internal demand and electricity rationing\". The oil sector's\nperformance was also particularly troubling, with oil GDP shrinking by 5%.\nMore importantly, the Central Bank hints at the root cause of the oil\ncontraction, saying that \"the bank said it was due to falls in production,\n\"operative problems\", maintenance stoppages and the channeling of diesel to\nrun thermal generators during a power crisis\". While the public sector of the\neconomy has fallen 2.8%, the private sector has dropped off 6%.\n\nThe year 2013 proved to be difficult for Venezuela as shortages of necessities\nand extreme inflation attacked the nation's economy. Items became so scarce\nthat nearly one quarter of items were not in stock. The bolívar was devalued\nto 6.3 per US$ in early 2013 taking one third of its value away. However,\ninflation still continued to rise drastically in the country to the point\nPresident Maduro forced stores to sell their items just days before elections.\nMaduro said that the stores were charging unreasonable prices even though the\nowners were only charging so much due to the actual devaluation of the\nbolívar.\n\nIn 2014 The Central Bank of Venezuela stopped releasing statistics for the\nfirst time in its history as a way to possibly manipulate the image of the\neconomy. Venezuela has also dismantled CADIVI, a government body in charge of\ncurrency exchange.\n\nIn May 2019, the Central Bank of Venezuela released economic data for the\nfirst time since 2015. According to this release, the inflation of Venezuela\nwas 274% in 2016, 863% in 2017 and 130,060% in 2018. The new reports imply a\ncontraction of more than half of the economy in five years, according to the\n_Financial Times_ \"one of the biggest contractions in Latin American history\".\nAccording two undisclosed sources from _Reuters,_ the release of this numbers\nwas due to pressure from China, a Maduro ally. One of this sources claims that\nthe disclosure of economic numbers may bring Venezuela into compliance with\nthe IMF, making it harder to support Juan Guaidó during the presidential\ncrisis. At the time, the IMF was not able to support the validity of the data\nas they had not been able to contact the authorities.\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2023.

    "text": "According to DolarToday.com, the value of one US dollar in Venezuelan\nbolívares fuertes on the black market through time: blue and red vertical\nlines represent every time the currency has lost 90% of its value, which has\nhappened seven times since 2012, meaning that the currency is worth (as of\nmid-February 2019) 30,000,000 times less than in August 2012, since it has\nlost more than 99.99999% of its value Inflation represented by the time it\nwould take for money to lose 90% of its value (301-day rolling average,\ninverted logarithmic scale)\n\nThe parallel exchange rate is what Venezuelans believe the Venezuelan currency\nis worth compared to the US$. In the first few years of Chávez's office, his\nnewly created social programs required large payments in order to make the\ndesired changes. On 5 February 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency\ncontrol board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation\nwas to control capital flight by placing limits on individuals and only\noffering them so much of a foreign currency. This limit to foreign currency\nled to a creation of a currency black market economy since Venezuelan\nmerchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign\ncurrencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the\nBolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the\ngovernment held the majority of the more reliable currencies.\n\nAs of January 2018, the strongest official exchange rate was 1 US$ to 10 VEF\nwhile the free market exchange rate was over 200,000 VEF to 1 US$. Since\nmerchants can only receive so much necessary foreign currency from the\ngovernment, they must resort to the black market which in turn raises the\nmerchant's prices on consumers. The high rates in the black market make it\ndifficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods since the government\noften forces these businesses to make price cuts. This leads to businesses\nselling their goods and making a low profit, such as Venezuelan McDonald's\nfranchises offering a Big Mac meal for only $1. Since businesses make low\nprofits, this leads to shortages since they are unable to import the goods\nthat Venezuela is reliant on. Venezuela's largest food producing company,\nEmpresas Polar, has stated that they may need to suspend some production for\nnearly the entire year of 2014 since they owe foreign suppliers $463 million.\nThe last report of shortages in Venezuela showed that 22.4% of necessary goods\nare not in stock. This was the last report by the government since the central\nbank no longer posts the scarcity index. This has led to speculation that the\ngovernment is hiding its inability to control the economy which may create\ndoubt about future economic data released."

    "text": "Like most Latin American countries, Venezuela has an unequal distribution of\nwealth. Although distribution improved when the surplus of rural labor started\nto diminish and the educational system improved in the middle of the 20th\ncentury, equality is far from coinciding with western standards. The rich tend\nto be very rich and the poor very poor. In 1970, the poorest fifth of the\npopulation had 3% of national income while the wealthiest fifth had 54%. For\ncomparison, the United Kingdom 1973 figures were 6.3% and 38.8% and the United\nStates in 1972, 4.5% and 42.8%. Inequality declined during the early 2000s as\nthe government spent heavily on social programs to improve the well-being of\nthe poor. The economic crisis since 2013 has greatly increased inequality\nsince the heavily subsidized services that the poor rely on, such as public\nhospitals and food distribution, have experienced severe shortages of\nessential imported goods. Hyperinflation has destroyed the value of savings,\nplunging many formerly stable, middle-class Venezuelans into extreme poverty.\nConversely, the very wealthy are more likely to have access to overseas\nfinancial services allowing them to store their wealth in stable foreign\ncurrencies and escape the catastrophic collapse of the Venezuelan currency.\n\nThe more recent income distribution data available is for distribution per\ncapita, not per household. The two are not strictly comparable because poor\nhouseholds tend to have more members than rich households, thus the per\nhousehold data tends to show less inequality than the per capita data. The\ntable below shows the available per capita data for recent years from the\nWorld Bank.\n\nPersonal income distribution  Year  | Share of personal income (%) received by:  | GINI index\n---|---|---\nPoorest fifth  | 2nd fifth  | 3rd fifth  | 4th fifth  | Wealthiest fifth  | Wealthiest 10%\n1987  | 4.7  | 9.2  | 14.0  | 21.5  | 50.6  | 34.2  | ~43.42\n1995  | 4.3  | 8.8  | 13.8  | 21.3  | 51.8  | 35.6  | 46.8\n1996  | 3.7  | 8.4  | 13.6  | 21.2  | 53.1  | 37.0  | 48.8\n2000  | 4.7  | 9.4  | 14.5  | 22.1  | 45.4  | 29.9  | 42.0\n2004  | 3.5  | —  | 12.9  | —  | 54.8  | —  | 45.59\n2007  | 5.1  | —  | 14.2  | —  | 47.7  | —  | 42.37\n2010  | 5.7  | —  | 14.9  | —  | 44.8  | —  | 38.98\n2011  | 5.7  | —  | 15.9  | —  | 44.8  | —  | 39.02\n2013  | —  | —  | —  | —  | —  | —  | 44.8\n2015  | —  | —  | —  | —  | —  | —  | 46.9\nNote that personal (per capita) income distribution, given in this table, is\nnot exactly comparable with household income distribution, given in the\nprevious table, because poor households tend to have more members.\n\nSources\n\n1987 data: 1991 _World Development Report_ , Table 30, pp. 262–63.\n1995 data: 1998 _World Development Report_ , Table 2.8, p. 70.\n1996 data: 2000/2001 _World Development Report_ , Table 5, pp. 282–83.\n2000 data: 2006 _World Development Indicators_ , Table 2.8.\nAll of the above publications are by the World Bank.\n\n2004 data: _Instituto Nacional de Estadística_ , p. 8\n2007 data: _Instituto Nacional de Estadística_ , p. 8\n2010 data: _Instituto Nacional de Estadística_ , p. 8\n2011 data: _Instituto Nacional de Estadística_ , p. 8\n2013 data: _United Nations Development Programme_\n2015 data: _United Nations Development Programme_\n\nPoverty in Venezuela increased during the 1980s and early 1990s, but it\ndecreased greatly in the mid to late 1990s. The decreasing trend continued\nthrough the Chávez presidency, with the exception of the troubled years 2002\nand 2003. Under the Bolivarian government, poverty decreased initially when\nVenezuela acquired oil funds, though poverty began to increase to its highest\nlevel in decades in the 2010s. Throughout its modern history, inequality and\npoverty rates have wildly fluctuated from year to year, owing to the\ngovernment's dependence on unreliable oil revenues which send the economy into\nalternating periods of rapid growth and catastrophic recession. The poverty\nrate decreased from 55% to 27% in the 5-year period between 2003 and 2008,\nonly to then skyrocket to over 80% in the 5 years between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe table below shows the percentage of people and the percentage of\nhouseholds whose income is below a poverty line which is equal to the price of\na market basket of necessities such as food.\n\nPercentage of people and households with income below national poverty line  Year  | 1989  | 1997  | 1998  | 1999  | 2000  | 2001  | 2002  | 2003  | 2004  | 2005  | 2006  | 2007  | 2008  | 2009  | 2010  | 2011  | 2012  | 2013  | 2014  | 2015  | 2016  | 2017\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nHouseholds  | –  | 48.1  | 43.9  | 42.0  | 40.4  | 39.0  | 48.6  | 55.1  | 47.0  | 37.9  | 30.6  | 28.5  | 27.5  | 26.7  | 26.9  | 26.5  | 21.1  | 27.3  | 48.4  | 73.0  | 81.8  | 87.0\nPeople  | 31.3  | 54.5  | 50.4  | 48.7  | 46.3  | 45.4  | 55.4  | 62.1  | 53.9  | 43.7  | 36.3  | 33.7  | 32.6  | 31.8  | 32.5  | 31.6  | 25.4  | 32.1  | –  | –  | –  | –\n\nSources\n\n\nWorld Bank, 1997 _World Development Indicators_ , p. 52;\nVenezuela, Instituto Nacional de Estadística, _Pobreza por línea de ingreso, 1er semestre 1997 – 2do semestre 2013_ Archived 27 July 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

    "text": "In the early 2000s, when oil prices soared and offered Chávez funds not seen\nsince the beginning of Venezuela's economic collapse in the 1980s, Chávez's\ngovernment became \"semi-authoritarian and hyper-populist\" and consolidated its\npower over the economy in order to gain control of large amounts of resources.\nDomestically, Chávez used such oil funds for populist policies, creating the\nBolivarian missions, aimed at providing public services to improve economic,\ncultural and social conditions. Despite warnings near the beginning of\nChávez's tenure in the early 2000s, Chávez's government continuously overspent\nin social spending and did not save enough money for any future economic\nturmoil, which Venezuela faced shortly before and after his death. On the year\nof Chávez's death, Venezuela was still categorized as having high human\ndevelopment on its Human Development Index in 2013 according to the United\nNations Development Programme, although human development began to decline in\nVenezuela within a year, with the country dropping 10 ranks by 2014."

    "text": "Extreme poverty and lack of food and medicines has pushed more than three\nmillion Venezuelans to leave the country in recent years. Andres Bello\nCatholic University conducted a study of poverty that found the poorest 20% of\nVenezuelans had 1.4% of the nation's wealth, down from 3.4% in 2014, while the\nrichest 10% had 61% of the nation's wealth, up from 30%.\n\nAccording to government figures released in April 2017, 1,446 children under\nthe age of 1 died in 2016, representing a 30 percent increase in one year. As\nof August 2017, 31 million people suffered from severe food shortages. The\nENCOVI universities survey found that 73% of Venezuelans said they had lost 9\nkg (20 lb) of body weight in 2016 and 64% had lost 11 kg (24 lb) in 2017.\n\nWhen the country's economy collapsed in 2014, hunger and malnutrition became a\nsevere problem. In 2015, close to 45% of Venezuelans said they were unable to\nafford food at times. In 2018, this figure rose to 79%, one of the highest\nrates in the world.\n\nAlthough poverty initially declined under Chávez, Venezuela's poverty rate\nincreased to 28% by 2013, with extreme poverty rates increasing 4.4% to 10%\naccording to the Venezuelan government's INE. Estimates of poverty by the\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)\nand Luis Pedro España, a sociologist at the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello,\nshowed an increase of poverty in Venezuela. ECLAC showed a 2013 poverty rate\nof 32% while Pedro España calculated a 2015 rate of 48%. The Venezuelan\ngovernment estimated that 33% were in poverty in the first half of 2015 and\nthen stopped producing statistics. According to Venezuelan NGO PROVEA, by the\nend of 2015 there would be the same number of Venezuelans living in poverty as\nthere was in 2000, reversing the advancements against poverty by Chávez. The\nENCOVI annual survey by three universities estimated poverty at 48% in 2014,\n82% in 2016 and 87% in 2017.\n\nIn relation to hunger, under-nutrition, undernourishment and the percentage of\nchildren under the age of five who are moderately or severely underweight\ndecreased earlier in Chávez's tenure. However, shortages in Venezuela as a\nresult of price control policies and heavy import dependence left the majority\nof Venezuelans without adequate products after his death."

The primary completion rate for both sexes\nreached 95.1% in 2009 as compared to 80.8% in 1991. The literacy rates of 15-\nto 24-year-olds in 2007, for men and women, were 98% and 98.8%, respectively.\nAmong the first migrants the left Venezuela during the Bolivarian Revolution,\na large percentage of the millions of Venezuelans who left the country were\nhighly educated, resulting in a brain drain in the country.\n\nIn 2008, Francisco Rodríguez of Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Daniel\nOrtega of IESA stated that there was \"little evidence\" of \"statistically\ndistinguishable effect on Venezuelan illiteracy\" during the Chávez\nadministration. The Venezuelan government claimed that it had taught 1.5\nmillion Venezuelans to read, but the study found that \"only 1.1m were\nilliterate to begin with\" and that the illiteracy reduction of less than\n100,000 can be attributed to adults that were elderly and died."

    "text": "Healthcare spending by percentage of Venezuela's GDP\nSource: World Bank\n\nFollowing the Bolivarian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolivarian\ngovernment, initial healthcare practices were promising with the installation\nof a free healthcare system parallel to the existing national public health\nsystem, with the assistance received from Cuban medical professionals\nproviding aid. The Bolivarian government's failure to concentrate on\nhealthcare for Venezuelans, the reduction of healthcare spending and\ngovernment corruption eventually affected medical practices in Venezuela,\ncausing avoidable deaths along with an emigration of medical professionals to\nother countries.\n\nVenezuela's reliance on imported goods and its complicated exchange rates\ninitiated under Chávez led to increasing shortages during the late-2000s and\ninto the 2010s that affected the availability of medicines and medical\nequipment in the country. The United Nations reported an increase in the\nmaternal mortality ratio, which increased from 93 per 100,000 in 1990 to 110\nper 100,000 in 2013. Following shortages of many medical and common goods in\n2014, Venezuelan women have had difficulties accessing contraceptives and were\nforced to change prescriptions or search several stores and the Internet for\ntheir medications. Shortage of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS\naffected about 50,000 Venezuelans in 2014 as well, potentially causing\nthousands of Venezuelans with HIV to develop AIDS.\n\nVenezuela is also the only country in Latin America where the incidence of\nmalaria is increasing, allegedly due to illegal mining. In 2013, Venezuela\nregistered the highest number of cases of malaria in the past 50 years, with\n300 of 100,000 Venezuelans being infected with the disease."

In fact, the number of Internet\nsubscribers has increased sixfold. Programs such as the National Technological\nLiteracy Plan, which provides free software and computers to schools, have\nassisted Venezuela in meeting this goal. However, several experts state that\nthe poor infrastructure in Venezuela had created a poor quality of Internet in\nVenezuela, which has one of the slowest Internet speeds in the world. The lack\nof US$ due to the Venezuelan governments currency controls has also damaged\nInternet services because technological equipment must be imported into\nVenezuela.\n\nThe number of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants was 7.56 in 1990. The\nnumber increased to 24.44 in 2010. In 2000, 2,535,966 Venezuelans had landline\ntelephones. By 2009, this had increased to 6,866,626.\n\nThe Bolivarian government has also launched an aerospace program in\ncooperation with the People's Republic of China who built and launched two\nsatellites that are currently in orbit—a communications satellite called Simón\nBolívar and a remote sensing satellite called Miranda. In July 2014, President\nMaduro announced that a third satellite would be built by Chinese–Venezuelan\nbilateral cooperation."
