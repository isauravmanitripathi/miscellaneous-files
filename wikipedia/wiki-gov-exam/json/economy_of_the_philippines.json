    "text": "The **economy of the Philippines** is an emerging market, and considered as a\nnewly industrialized country in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2025, the\nPhilippine economy is estimated to be at ₱28.50 trillion ($497.5 billion),\nmaking it the world's 32nd largest by nominal GDP and 9th largest in Asia\naccording to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Philippine economy is a service-oriented economy, with relatively more\nmodest contributions from the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. It has\nexperienced significant economic growth and transformation in the past,\nposting one of the highest GDP growth rates in Asia. With an average annual\ngrowth rate of around 6 percent since 2010, the country has emerged as one of\nthe fastest-growing economies in the world. The Philippines is a founding\nmember of the United Nations, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation, East Asia Summit and the World Trade\nOrganization. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is headquartered in the Ortigas\nCenter located in the city of Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.\n\nThe country's primary exports include semiconductors and electronic products,\ntransport equipment, garments, chemical products, copper, nickel, abaca,\ncoconut oil, and fruits. Its major trading partners include Japan, China, the\nUnited States, Singapore, South Korea, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany,\nTaiwan, and Thailand.\n\nIn 2017, the Philippine economy was projected to become the 9th largest in\nAsia and 19th largest in the world by 2050. By 2035, the Filipino economy is\npredicted to be the 22nd largest in the world.\n\nThe Philippines has been named as one of the Tiger Cub Economies, alongside\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. However, major problems remain,\nmainly related to alleviating the wide income and growth disparities between\nthe country's different regions and socioeconomic classes, reducing\ncorruption, and investing in the infrastructure necessary to ensure future\ngrowth.\n\nIn 2024, the World Economic Forum chief Børge Brende said that “there is a\nreal opportunity for this country to become a $2-trillion economy.”"
