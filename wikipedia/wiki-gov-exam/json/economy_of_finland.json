    "text": "| This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( September 2022)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **economy ofFinland** is a highly industrialised, mixed economy with a per\ncapita output similar to that of western European economies such as France,\nGermany, and the United Kingdom. The largest sector of Finland's economy is\nits service sector, which contributes 72.7% to the country's gross domestic\nproduct (GDP); followed by manufacturing and refining at 31.4%; and the\nprimary sector at 2.9%. Among OECD nations, Finland has a highly efficient and\nstrong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 29% of GDP.\n\nFinland's key economic sector is manufacturing. The largest industries are\nelectronics (21.6% - very old data), machinery, vehicles and other engineered\nmetal products (21.1%), forest industry (13.1%), and chemicals (10.9%).\nFinland has timber and several mineral and freshwater resources. Forestry,\npaper factories, and the agricultural sector (on which taxpayers spend around\n2 billion euro annually) are politically sensitive to rural residents. The\nHelsinki metropolitan area generates around a third of GDP.\n\nIn a 2004 OECD comparison, high-technology manufacturing in Finland ranked\nsecond largest in the world, after Ireland. Investment was below the expected\nlevels. The overall short-term outlook was good and GDP growth has been above\nmany of its peers in the European Union. Finland has the 4th largest knowledge\neconomy in Europe, behind Sweden, Denmark and the UK. The economy of Finland\ntops the ranking of the Global Information Technology 2014 report by the World\nEconomic Forum for concerted output between the business sector, the scholarly\nproduction and the governmental assistance on information and communications\ntechnology.\n\nAviapolis, Vantaa is one of the most significant growing economic areas in\nFinland.\n\nFinland is highly integrated in the global economy, and international trade\nrepresents a third of the GDP. Trade with the European Union represents 60% of\nthe country's total trade. The largest trade flows are with Germany, Russia,\nSweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands and China. The\ntrade policy is managed by the European Union, where Finland has traditionally\nbeen among the free trade supporters, except for agriculture. Finland is the\nonly Nordic country to have joined the Eurozone; Denmark and Sweden have\nretained their traditional currencies, whereas Iceland and Norway are not\nmembers of the EU at all. Finland has been ranked seventh in the Global\nInnovation Index of 2023, making it the seventh most innovative country down\nfrom 2nd in 2018."

But\nas a relatively poor country, it was vulnerable to shocks to the economy such\nas the great famine of 1867–1868, which killed around 15% of the country's\npopulation. Until the 1930s, the Finnish economy was predominantly agrarian\nand, as late as the 1950s, more than half the population and 40% of output\nwere still in the primary sector.[_citation needed_]"

    "text": "While nationalization committees were set up in France and the United Kingdom,\nFinland avoided nationalizations. Finnish industry recovered quickly after the\nSecond World War. By the end of 1946, industrial output had surpassed pre-war\nnumbers. In the immediate post-war period of 1946 to 1951, Finnish industry\ncontinued to grow rapidly. Many factors contributed to the rapid industrial\ngrowth. War reparations were largely paid in manufactured products. The\ndevaluation of currency in 1945 and 1949, which made the US dollar rise by 70%\nagainst the Finnish markka, and thus boosted exports to the West. This helped\nwith rebuilding the country and increased demand for Finnish industrial\nproducts. In 1951, the Korean War boosted Finnish exports. Finland practiced\nan active exchange rate policy. Devaluation was used several times to raise\nthe competitiveness of the Finnish exporting industries.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1975, Finland's industry was at the mercy of international\neconomic trends. The fast industrial growth in 1953-1955 was followed by a\nperiod of more moderate growth, starting in 1956. The causes for the\ndeceleration of growth were the general strike of 1956, as well as weakened\nexport trends and easing of the strict regulation of Finland's foreign trade\nin 1957. These events compelled Finnish industry to compete against ever\ntoughening international challengers. An economic recession brought industrial\noutput down by 3.4% in 1958. Industry, however, recovered quickly during the\ninternational economic boom that followed the recession. One reason for this\nwas the devaluation of the Finnish markka, which increased the value of the US\ndollar by 39% against the Finnish markka.\n\nThe international economy was stable in the 1960s. This trend can be seen in\nFinland as well, where steady growth of industrial output could be seen\nthroughout the decade.\n\nAfter failed experiments with protectionism,[_citation needed_] Finland eased\nsome restrictions and signed a free trade agreement with the European\nCommunity in 1973. This made Finnish markets more competitive.\n\nFinland's industrial output declined in 1975. The decline was caused by the\nfree trade agreement that was made between Finland and the European Community\nin 1973. The agreement subjected Finnish industry to ever toughening\ninternational competition. Finnish exports to the west decreased. In 1976 and\n1977, the growth in industrial output was almost zero. In 1978, it swung back\ntowards a strong growth. In 1978 and 1979, Finnish industrial output grew at\nan above average rate. The stimuli for this were three devaluations of Finnish\nmarkka, which lowered value of the markka by a total of 19%. Impacts from the\nglobal 1979 oil crisis on Finnish industry were alleviated by Finland's\nbilateral trade with the Soviet Union.\n\nLocal education markets expanded. An increasing number of Finns went to study\nabroad in the United States and in Western Europe. These students later\nreturned to Finland, bringing back useful and advanced professional skills.\n[_citation needed_] There was quite a common pragmatic credit and investment\ncooperation between the state and Finnish corporations. It raised suspicion in\nthe populace, due to support for capitalism and free trade from the populace.\nHowever, the Finnish communist party (Finnish People's Democratic League)\nreceived 23.2% of the votes in the 1958 parliamentary elections. Savings rates\nin Finland hovered among the world's highest, at around 8%, all the way to the\n1980s. In the beginning of the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita reached the\nlevel of Japan and the UK. Finland's economic development was similar to some\nexport-led Asian countries. The official policy of neutrality enabled Finland\nto trade both with Western and Comecon markets. Significant bilateral trade\nwas conducted with the Soviet Union, but this was not allowed to grow into a\ndependence."

    "text": "Like other Nordic countries, Finland has liberalized its system of economic\nregulation since late 1980s. The financial and product market regulations were\nmodified. Some state enterprises were privatized and some tax rates were\naltered. In 1991, the Finnish economy fell into a severe recession. This was\ncaused by a combination of economic overheating (largely due to a change in\nthe banking laws in 1986 which made credit much more accessible), depressed\nmarkets with key trading partners (particularly the Swedish and Soviet\nmarkets), as well as in the local markets. Slow growth with other trading\npartners, and the disappearance of the Soviet bilateral trade had its effects.\nThe stock market and the Finnish housing market decreased by 50% in value. The\ngrowth in the 1980s was based on debt, and when the defaults began rolling in,\nGDP declined by 13%. Unemployment increased from almost full employment to one\nfifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by the trade unions' initial\nopposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to cut spending and the\npublic debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Much of the economic growth in the\n1980s was based on debt financing. Debt defaults led to a savings and loan\ncrisis. Over 10 billion euros were used to bail out failing banks, which led\nto a banking sector consolidation. After devaluations, the depression bottomed\nout in 1993."

    "text": "An oxeye daisy and a cow in Kyyjärvi, Central Finland.\n\nFinland's climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge. The\ncountry lies between 60° and 70° north latitude - as far north as Alaska - and\nhas severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes\ninterrupted by frosts. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic\nDrift Current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low\nelevation of the land area, Finland contains half of the world's arable land\nnorth of 60° north latitude. In response to the climate, farmers have relied\non quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops. Most farmland had\noriginally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required\ntreatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to\ndevelop fertility. Irrigation was generally not necessary, but drainage\nsystems were often needed to remove excess water.\n\nUntil the late nineteenth century, Finland's isolation required that most\nfarmers concentrate on producing grains to meet the country's basic food\nneeds. In the fall, farmers planted rye; in the spring, southern and central\nfarmers started oats, while northern farmers seeded barley. Farms also grew\nsmall quantities of potatoes, other root crops, and legumes. Nevertheless, the\ntotal area under cultivation was still small. Cattle grazed in the summer and\nconsumed hay in the winter. Essentially self-sufficient, Finland engaged in\nvery limited agricultural trade.\n\nThis traditional, almost autarkic, production pattern shifted sharply during\nthe late nineteenth century, when inexpensive imported grain from Russia and\nthe United States competed effectively with local grain. At the same time,\nrising domestic and foreign demand for dairy products and the availability of\nlow-cost imported cattle feed made dairy and meat production much more\nprofitable. These changes in market conditions induced Finland's farmers to\nswitch from growing staple grains to producing meat and dairy products,\nsetting a pattern that persisted into the late 1980s.\n\nIn response to the agricultural depression of the 1930s, the government\nencouraged domestic production by imposing tariffs on agricultural imports.\nThis policy enjoyed some success: the total area under cultivation increased,\nand farm incomes fell less sharply in Finland than in most other countries.\nBarriers to grain imports stimulated a return to mixed farming, and by 1938\nFinland's farmers were able to meet roughly 90% of the domestic demand for\ngrain.\n\nThe disruptions caused by the Winter War and the Continuation War caused\nfurther food shortages, especially when Finland ceded territory, including\nabout one-tenth of its farmland, to the Soviet Union. The experiences of the\ndepression and the war years persuaded the Finns to secure independent food\nsupplies to prevent shortages in future conflicts.\n\nAfter the war, the first challenge was to resettle displaced farmers. Most\nrefugee farmers were given farms that included some buildings and land that\nhad already been in production, but some had to make do with \"cold farms,\"\nthat is, land not in production that usually had to be cleared or drained\nbefore crops could be sown. The government sponsored large-scale clearing and\ndraining operations that expanded the area suitable for farming. As a result\nof the resettlement and land-clearing programs, the area under cultivation\nexpanded by about 450,000 hectares, reaching about 2.4 million hectares by the\nearly 1960s. Finland thus came to farm more land than ever before, an unusual\ndevelopment in a country that was simultaneously experiencing rapid industrial\ngrowth.\n\nGDP growth of Finland\n\nDuring this period of expansion, farmers introduced modern production\npractices. The widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and\ninsecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply\nimproved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made farm production\ndependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and\nfertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20% of farm\nneeds, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70% of them. In the\naftermath of the oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to\nreturn to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms\nthat were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited\nmechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with open\ndrainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts\nestimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works. At that\ntime, about 1 million hectares had underground drainage, and agricultural\nauthorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares.\nDespite these shortcomings, Finland's agriculture was efficient and\nproductive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries."

    "text": "Forests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's\nleading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for\nthe crucial wood processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has\nlong played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring\ntechnical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the\ncountry's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries.\n\nFinland's wet climate and rocky soils are ideal for forests. Tree stands do\nwell throughout the country, except in some areas north of the Arctic Circle.\nIn 1980 the forested area totaled about 19.8 million hectares, providing 4\nhectares of forest per capita—far above the European average of about 0.5\nhectares. The proportion of forest land varied considerably from region to\nregion. In the central lake plateau and in the eastern and northern provinces,\nforests covered up to 80% of the land area, but in areas with better\nconditions for agriculture, especially in the southwest, forests accounted for\nonly 50 to 60% of the territory. The main commercial tree species—pine,\nspruce, and birch—supplied raw material to the sawmill, pulp, and paper\nindustries. The forests also produced sizable aspen and elder crops.\n\nThe heavy winter snows and the network of waterways were used to move logs to\nthe mills. Loggers were able to drag cut trees over the winter snow to the\nroads or water bodies. In the southwest, the sledding season lasted about 100\ndays per year; the season was even longer to the north and the east. The\ncountry's network of lakes and rivers facilitated log floating, a cheap and\nrapid means of transport. Each spring, crews floated the logs downstream to\ncollection points; tugs towed log bundles down rivers and across lakes to\nprocessing centers. The waterway system covered much of the country, and by\nthe 1980s Finland had extended roadways and railroads to areas not served by\nwaterways, effectively opening up all of the country's forest reserves to\ncommercial use.\n\nForestry and farming were closely linked. During the twentieth century,\ngovernment land redistribution programmes had made forest ownership\nwidespread, allotting forestland to most farms. In the 1980s, private farmers\ncontrolled 35% of the country's forests; other persons held 27%; the\ngovernment, 24%; private corporations, 9%; and municipalities and other public\nbodies, 5%. The forestlands owned by farmers and by other people—some 350,000\nplots—were the best, producing 75 to 80% of the wood consumed by industry; the\nstate owned much of the poorer land, especially that in the north.\n\nThe ties between forestry and farming were mutually beneficial. Farmers\nsupplemented their incomes with earnings from selling their wood, caring for\nforests, or logging; forestry made many otherwise marginal farms viable. At\nthe same time, farming communities maintained roads and other infrastructure\nin rural areas, and they provided workers for forest operations. Indeed,\nwithout the farming communities in sparsely populated areas, it would have\nbeen much more difficult to continue intensive logging operations and\nreforestation in many prime forest areas.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has carried out forest inventories\nand drawn up silvicultural plans. According to surveys, between 1945 and the\nlate 1970s foresters had cut trees faster than the forests could regenerate\nthem. Nevertheless, between the early 1950s and 1981, Finland was able to\nboost the total area of its forests by some 2.7 million hectares and to\nincrease forest stands under 40 years of age by some 3.2 million hectares.\nBeginning in 1965, the country instituted plans that called for expanding\nforest cultivation, draining peatland and waterlogged areas, and replacing\nslow-growing trees with faster-growing varieties. By the mid-1980s, the Finns\nhad drained 5.5 million hectares, fertilized 2.8 million hectares, and\ncultivated 3.6 million hectares. Thinning increased the share of trees that\nwould produce suitable lumber, while improved tree varieties increased\nproductivity by as much as 30%.\n\nComprehensive silvicultural programmes had made it possible for the Finns\nsimultaneously to increase forest output and to add to the amount and value of\nthe growing stock. By the mid-1980s, Finland's forests produced nearly 70\nmillion cubic meters of new wood each year, considerably more than was being\ncut. During the postwar period, the annual cut increased by about 120% to\nabout 50 million cubic meters. Wood burning fell to one-fifth the level of the\nimmediate postwar years, freeing up wood supplies for the wood-processing\nindustries, which consumed between 40 million and 45 million cubic meters per\nyear. Indeed, industry demand was so great that Finland needed to import 5\nmillion to 6 million cubic meters of wood each year.\n\nTo maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish\nauthorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological\nlimits. In 1984 the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the\nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest\nharvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and\nother uses. It also called for enlarging the average size of private forest\nholdings, increasing the area used for forests, and extending forest\ncultivation and thinning. If successful, the plan would make it possible to\nraise wood deliveries by roughly one-third by the end of the twentieth\ncentury. Finnish officials believed that such growth was necessary if Finland\nwas to maintain its share in world markets for wood and paper products."

Krugman notes that Sweden, which has yet to join the single currency,\nhad similar rates of growth compared to Finland for the period since the\nintroduction of the euro.\n\nMembership of the euro protects Finland from currency fluctuations, which is\nparticularly important for small member states of the European Union like\nFinland that are highly integrated into the larger European economy. If\nFinland had retained its own currency, unpredictable exchange rates would\nprevent the country from selling its products at competitive prices on the\nEuropean market. In fact, business leaders in Sweden, which is obliged to join\nthe euro when its economy has converged with the eurozone, are almost\nuniversal in their support for joining the euro. Although Sweden's currency is\nnot officially pegged to the euro like Denmark's currency the Swedish\ngovernment maintains an unofficial peg. This exchange rate policy has in the\nshort term benefited the Swedish economy in two ways; (1) much of Sweden's\nEuropean trade is already denominated in euros and therefore bypasses any\ncurrency fluctuation and exchange rate losses, (2) it allows Sweden's non-\neuro-area exports to remain competitive by dampening any pressure from the\nfinancial markets to increase the value of the currency.\n\nMaintaining this balance has allowed the Swedish government to borrow on the\ninternational financial markets at record low interest rates and allowed the\nSwedish central bank to quantitatively ease into a fundamentally sound\neconomy. This has led Sweden's economy to prosper at the expense of less sound\neconomies who have been impacted by the 2008 financial crisis. Sweden's\neconomic performance has therefore been slightly better than Finland's since\nthe 2008 financial crisis. Much of this disparity has, however, been due to\nthe economic dominance of Nokia, Finland's largest company and Finland's only\nmajor multinational. Nokia supported and greatly benefited from the euro and\nthe European single market, particularly from a common European digital mobile\nphone standard (GSM), but it failed to adapt when the market shifted to mobile\ncomputing.\n\nOne reason for the popularity of the euro in Finland is the memory of a 'great\ndepression' which began in 1990, with Finland not regaining it competitiveness\nuntil approximately a decade later when Finland joined the single currency.\nSome American economists like Paul Krugman claim not to understand the\nbenefits of a single currency and allege that poor economic performance is the\nresult of membership of the single currency. These economists do not, however,\nadvocate separate currencies for the states of the United States, many of\nwhich have quite disparate economies.\n\n| This graph was using the legacy Graph extension, which is no longer\nsupported.

There are\nalso property taxes, but municipal income tax pays most of municipal expenses.\nTaxation is conducted by a state agency, Verohallitus, which collects income\ntaxes from each paycheck, and then pays the difference between tax liability\nand taxes paid as tax rebate or collects as tax arrears afterward. Municipal\nincome tax is a flat tax of nominally 15-20%, with deductions applied, and\ndirectly funds the municipality (a city or rural locality). The state income\ntax is a progressive tax; low-income individuals do not necessarily pay any.\nThe state transfers some of its income as state support to municipalities,\nparticularly the poorer ones. Additionally, the state churches - Finnish\nEvangelical Lutheran Church and Finnish Orthodox Church \\- are integrated to\nthe taxation system in order to tax their members.\n\nThe middle income worker's tax wedge is 46% and effective marginal tax rates\nare very high. Value-added tax is 24% for most items. Capital gains tax is\n30-34% and corporate tax is 20%, about the EU median. Property taxes are low,\nbut there is a transfer tax (1.6% for apartments or 4% for individual houses)\nfor home buyers. There are high excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco,\nautomobiles and motorcycles, motor fuels, lotteries, sweets and insurances.\nFor instance, McKinsey estimates that a worker has to pay around 1600 euro for\nanother's 400 euro service - restricting service supply and demand - though\nsome taxation is avoided in the black market and self-service culture. Another\nstudy by Karlson, Johansson & Johnsson estimates that the fraction of the\nbuyer's income entering the service vendor's wallet (inverted tax wedge) is\nslightly over 15%, compared to 10% in Belgium, 25% in France, 40% in\nSwitzerland and 50% in the United States.[_needs update_] Tax cuts have been\nin every post-depression government's agenda and the overall tax burden is now\naround 43% of GDP compared to 51.1% in Sweden, 34.7% in Germany, 33.5% in\nCanada, and 30.5% in Ireland.\n\nHigh income workers, for instance someone making €10000/month gross, living in\nthe city of Vantaa and using €3000/year on commuting to work, pay 33% income\ntax plus 7.94% social security payments (this varies mildly depending on the\nage of the worker, but for someone born in 1975, it is currently in the year\n2024, 7.94%). This means that 40,94% of the gross income goes to taxes and tax\nlike payments.\n\nState and municipal politicians have struggled to cut their consumption, which\nis very high at 51.7% of GDP compared to 56.6% in Sweden, 46.9% in Germany,\n39.3% in Canada, and 33.5% in Ireland. Much of the taxes are spent on public\nsector employees, which amount to 124,000 state employees and 430,000\nmunicipal employees. That is 113 per 1000 residents (over a quarter of\nworkforce) compared to 74 in the US, 70 in Germany, and 42 in Japan (8% of\nworkforce). The Economist Intelligence Unit's ranking for Finland's\ne-readiness is high at 13th, compared to 1st for United States, 3rd for\nSweden, 5th for Denmark, and 14th for Germany. Also, early and generous\nretirement schemes have contributed to high pension costs. Social spending\nsuch as health or education is around OECD median. Social transfers are also\naround OECD median. In 2001 Finland's outsourced proportion of spending was\nbelow Sweden's and above most other Western European countries. Finland's\nhealth care is more bureaucrat-managed than in most Western European\ncountries, though many use private insurance or cash to enjoy private clinics.\nSome reforms toward more equal marketplace have been made in 2007–2008. In\neducation, child nurseries, and elderly nurseries private competition is\nbottom-ranking compared to Sweden and most other Western countries. Some\npublic monopolies such Alko remain, and are sometimes challenged by the\nEuropean Union.

    "text": "Finland's export-dependent economy continuously adapted to the world market;\nin doing so, it changed Finnish society as well. The prolonged worldwide boom,\nbeginning in the late 1940s and lasting until the first oil crisis in 1973,\nwas a challenge that Finland met and from which it emerged with a highly\nsophisticated and diversified economy, including a new occupational structure.\nSome sectors kept a fairly constant share of the work force. Transportation\nand construction, for example, each accounted for between 7 and 8% in both\n1950 and 1985, and manufacturing's share rose only from 22 to 24%. However,\nboth the commercial and the service sectors more than doubled their share of\nthe work force, accounting, respectively, for 21 and 28% in 1985. The greatest\nchange was the decline of the economically active population employed in\nagriculture and forestry, from approximately 50% in 1950 to 10% in 1985. The\nexodus from farms and forests provided the labour power needed for the growth\nof other sectors.\n\nStudies of Finnish mobility patterns since World War II have confirmed the\nsignificance of this exodus. Sociologists have found that people with a\nfarming background were present in other occupations to a considerably greater\nextent in Finland than in other West European countries. Finnish data for the\nearly 1980s showed that 30 to 40% of those in occupations not requiring much\neducation were the children of farmers, as were about 25% in upper-level\noccupations, a rate two to three times that of France and noticeably higher\nthan that even of neighboring Sweden. Finland also differed from the other\nNordic countries in that the generational transition from the rural\noccupations to white-collar positions was more likely to be direct, bypassing\nmanual occupations.\n\nThe most important factor determining social mobility in Finland was\neducation. Children who attained a higher level of education than their\nparents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. In the\nHelsinki Metropolitan Area, those who are more educated, in the long-run, will\nmove to newer centrally located buildings. A tripling or quadrupling in any\none generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum\nreflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining\nadvanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however,\nand the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become\nwhite-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-\ncollar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more\nlikely than not to remain in that class.\n\nThe economic transformation also altered income structure. A noticeable shift\nwas the reduction in wage differentials. The increased wealth produced by an\nadvanced economy was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad\nincome agreements that evolved in the postwar era. Organized sectors of the\neconomy received wage hikes even greater than the economy's growth rate. As a\nresult, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the\npay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle\nclass declined in relation to that of other groups.\n\nThe long trend of growth in living standards paired with diminishing\ndifferences between social classes was dramatically reversed during the 1990s.\nFor the first time in the history of Finland income differences have sharply\ngrown. This change has been mostly driven by the growth of income from capital\nto the wealthiest segment of the population."
