    "text": "The **economy of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo** declined drastically in\nthe years leading up to and during the First and Second Congo Wars, despite\nbeing home to vast potential in natural resources and mineral wealth; its\ngross domestic product is $69.474 billion as of 2023. During the last five\nreported years, the exports of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have\nchanged by $15.2B from $13.3B in 2017 to $28.5B in 2022. Since 2003, the DRC's\neconomy has gradually grown, but it remains one of the poorest countries in\nthe world.\n\nAt the time of its independence in 1960, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nwas the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa. It\nhad a thriving mining sector, and its agriculture sector was relatively\nproductive. Since then, decades of corruption, war, and political instability\nhave been a severe detriment to further growth, today leaving DRC with a GDP\nper capita and a HDI rating that rank among the world's lowest and make the\nDRC one of the most fragile and, according to the United Nations, least\ndeveloped countries in the world.\n\nDespite this, the DRC is quickly modernizing; it tied with Malaysia for the\nlargest positive change in HDI development in 2016. Government projects\ninclude strengthening the health system for maternal and child health,\nexpansion of electricity access, water supply reconstructions, and urban and\nsocial rehabilitation programs."

    "text": "The two recent conflicts (the First and Second Congo Wars), which began in\n1996, have dramatically reduced national output and government revenue, have\nincreased external debt, and have resulted in the deaths of more than five\nmillion people from war and associated famine and disease. Malnutrition\naffects approximately two-thirds of the country's population.\n\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 57.9% of GDP in\n1997. In 1996, agriculture employed 66% of the workforce.\n\nRich in minerals, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has a difficult history\nof predatory mineral extraction, which has been at the heart of many struggles\nwithin the country for many decades, but particularly in the 1990s. The\neconomy of the second largest country in Africa relies heavily on mining.\nHowever, much economic activity occurs in the informal sector and is not\nreflected in GDP data.\n\nIn 2006, Transparency International ranked the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo 156 out of 163 countries in the Corruption Perception Index, tying\nBangladesh, Chad, and Sudan with a 2.0 rating. President Joseph Kabila\nestablished the Commission of Repression of Economic Crimes upon his ascension\nto power in 2001.\n\nThe conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo were over water, minerals,\nand other resources. Political agendas have worsened the economy, as in times\nof crisis, the elite benefit while the general populace suffers. This is\nworsened as a result of corrupt national and international corporations. The\ncorporations instigate and allow the fighting for resources because they\nbenefit from it. A large proportion of fatalities in the country are\nattributed to a lack of basic services, recognized as \"communicable, maternal,\nperinatal, and nutritional conditions,\" which account for 56% of deaths by\nbroad cause. The influx of refugees since the war in 1998 only serves to\nworsen the issue of poverty. Money of the taxpayers in the DRC is often\nmisappropriated by the corrupt leaders of the country, who use the money to\nbenefit themselves instead of the citizens of the DRC. The DRC is consistently\nranked among the lowest countries on the UN Human Development Index."

    "text": "Forced labor (slavery) was important for the rural sector. The corporations\nthat dominated the economy were mostly owned by Belgium, but British capital\nalso played an important role. The 1950s were a period of rising income and\nexpectations. Congo was said to have the best public health system in Africa,\nbut there was also a huge wealth disparity. Belgian companies favored workers\nin certain areas more and exported them to work in different areas,\nrestricting opportunities for others. Favored groups also received better\neducation and were able to secure jobs for people in the same ethnic group,\nwhich increased tensions. In 1960 there were only 16 university graduates out\nof a population of 20 million. Belgium still had economic power, and\nindependence gave little opportunity for improvement. Common refrains included\n\"no elite, no trouble\" and \"before independence = after independence.\" When\nthe Belgians left, most of the government officials and educated residents\nleft with them. Before independence, there were just 3 out of 5000 government\njobs held by Congolese people. The resulting loss of institutional knowledge\nand human capital crippled the government.\n\nCongolese exports in 2006."

    "text": "After the Congo Crisis, Mobutu arose as the country's sole ruler and\nstabilized the country politically. Economically, however, the situation\ncontinued to decline, and by 1979, the purchasing power was only 4% of that\nfrom 1960. Starting in 1976, the IMF provided stabilizing loans to the\ndictatorship. Much of the money was embezzled by Mobutu and his circle. This\nwas not a secret, as the 1982 report by IMF's envoy, Erwin Blumenthal,\ndocumented. He stated, \"It is alarmingly clear that the corruptive system in\nZaire, with all its wicked and ugly manifestations, its mismanagement and\nfraud, will destroy all endeavors of international institutions, of friendly\ngovernments, and of the commercial banks towards recovery and rehabilitation\nof Zaire’s economy\". Blumenthal indicated that there was \"no chance\" that\ncreditors would ever recover their loans. Yet the IMF and the World Bank\ncontinued to lend money that was either embezzled, stolen, or \"wasted on\n_white elephant_ projects\". \"Structural adjustment programmes\" implemented as\na condition of IMF loans cut support for health care, education, and\ninfrastructure."

The government has been unable to provide foreign exchange for\neconomic transactions, while it has resorted to printing money to finance its\nexpenditure.

The first SEZ was planned to come into being in 2012\nin N'Sele, a commune of Kinshasa, and will focus on agro-industries. The\nCongolese authorities also planned to open another zone dedicated to mining\n(Katanga) and a third dedicated to cement (in the Bas-Congo). There are three\nphases to the program that each have their own objectives. Phase I was the\nprecursor to the actual investment in the Special Economic Zone, where\npolicymakers agreed to the framework, the framework was studied for its\nestablishment, and to predict the potential market demand for the land. Stage\none of Phase II involved submitting laws for the Special Economic Zone,\nfinding good sites for businesses, and currently there is an effort to help\nthe government attract foreign investment. Stage two of Phase II hasn't been\nstarted yet, and it involves assisting the government in creating a framework\nfor the country, creating an overall plan for the site, figuring out what the\nenvironmental impact of the project will be, and guessing how much it will\ncost and what the return can be made on the investment. Phase III involves the\nWorld Bank creating a transaction phase that will keep everything competitive.\nThe program is looking for options to hand over the program to the World Bank,\nwhich could be very beneficial for the western part of the country."

    "text": "Ongoing conflicts dramatically reduced government revenue and increased\nexternal debt. As Reyntjens wrote, \"Entrepreneurs of insecurity are engaged in\nextractive activities that would be impossible in a stable state environment.\nThe criminalization context in which these activities occur offers avenues for\nconsiderable factional and personal enrichment through the trafficking of\narms, illegal drugs, toxic products, mineral resources and dirty\nmoney.\"[_citation needed_] Ethnic rivalries were made worse because of\neconomic interests and looting and coltan smuggling took place. Illegal\nmonopolies formed in the country where they used forced labor for children to\nmine or work as soldiers. National parks were overrun with people looking to\nexploit minerals and resources. Increased poverty and hunger from the war\nincreased the hunting of rare wildlife. Education was denied when the country\nwas under foreign control, and very few people made money off the minerals in\nthe country. The national resources are not the root cause of the continued\nfighting in the region; however, the competition has become an incentive to\nkeep fighting.[1] The DRC's level of economic freedom is one of the lowest in\nthe world, putting it in the repressed category. The armed militias fight with\nthe government in the eastern section of the country over the mining sector or\nthe corruption of the government, and weak policies lead to the instability of\nthe economy. Human rights abuses also ruin economic activity; the DRC has a 7%\nunemployment rate but still has one of the lowest GDPs per capita in the\nworld. A major problem for people trying to start their own companies is that\nthe minimum amount of capital needed to launch the company is five times the\naverage annual income, and prices are regulated by the government, which\nalmost forces people to have to work for the larger, more corrupt businesses;\notherwise, they won't have work. It is hard for the DRC to encourage foreign\ntrade because of the regulatory barriers."
