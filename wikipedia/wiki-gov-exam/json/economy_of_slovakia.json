    "text": "Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has\nundergone a transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market\neconomy, a process which some observers were to believe was slowed in the\n1994–98 period due to the crony capitalism and other fiscal policies of Prime\nMinister Vladimír Mečiar's government. While economic growth and other\nfundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt\nand trade deficits also rose, and privatization was uneven. Real annual GDP\ngrowth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999.\n\nTwo governments of the \"liberal-conservative\" Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda\n(1998–2006) pursued policies of macroeconomic stabilization and market-\noriented structural reforms. Nearly the entire economy has now been\nprivatized, and foreign investment has picked up. Economic growth exceeded\nexpectations in the early 2000s, despite recession in key export markets. In\n2001 policies of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform led to\nspiraling unemployment. Unemployment peaked at 19.2% (Eurostat regional\nindicators) in 2001. Solid domestic demand boosted economic growth to 4.1% in\n2002. Strong export growth, in turn, pushed economic growth to a still-strong\n4.2% in 2003 and 5.4% in 2004, despite a downturn in household consumption.\nMultiple reasons entailed a GDP growth of 6% in 2005. Headline consumer price\ninflation dropped from 26% in 1993 to an average rate of 7.5% in 2004, though\nthis was boosted by hikes in subsidized utilities prices ahead of Slovakia's\naccession to the European Union. In July 2005, the inflation rate dropped to\n2.0% and is projected at less than 3% in 2005 and 2.5% in 2006. In 2006,\nSlovakia reached the highest economic growth (8.9%) among the members of OECD\nand the third highest in the EU (just behind Estonia and Latvia). The country\nhas had difficulties addressing regional imbalances in wealth and employment.\nGDP per capita ranges from 188% of EU average in Bratislava to only 54% in\nEastern Slovakia.\n\nAbout 10% of the Slovak labour force is expatriate in 2014. The country has\none of the highest levels of long-term unemployment in Europe, with 7.1% of\nthe labour force unemployed for more than a year in 2017.\n\n99.9% of Slovak firms are small and medium-sized enterprises and they account\nfor 73.3% of all jobs in the country.",
