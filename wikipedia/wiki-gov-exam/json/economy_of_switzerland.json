Before that time, the\ncity-cantons of Zürich, Geneva, and Basel in particular began to develop\neconomically based on industry and trade, while the rural regions of\nSwitzerland remained poor and underdeveloped. While a workshop system had been\nin existence throughout the early modern period, the production of machines\nbegan in 1801 in St. Gallen, with the third generation of machines imported\nfrom Great Britain. But in Switzerland, hydraulic power was often used instead\nof steam engines because of the country's mountainous topography and lack of\nsignificant deposits of coal. By 1814, hand weaving had been mostly replaced\nby the power loom. Both tourism and banking began to develop as economic\nfactors at about the same time. While Switzerland was primarily rural, the\ncities experienced an industrial revolution in the late 19th century, focused\nespecially on textiles. In Basel, for example, textiles, including silk, were\nthe leading industry. In 1888, women made up 44% of wage earners. Nearly half\nthe women worked in the textile mills, with household servants the second\nlargest job category. The proportion of women in the workforce was higher\nbetween 1890 and 1910 than it was in the late 1960s and 1970s.\n\nRailways played a major part in industrialization; the first railway opened in\n1847, between Zürich and Baden.

    "text": "The industrial sector began to grow in the 19th century with a laissez-faire\nindustrial/trade policy, Switzerland's emergence as one of the most prosperous\nnations in Europe, sometimes termed the \"Swiss miracle\", was a development of\nthe mid 19th to early 20th centuries, among other things tied to the role of\nSwitzerland during the World Wars.\n\nSwitzerland's total energy consumption, which was dropping from the mid 1910s\nto the early 1920s, started to increase again in the early 1920s. It stagnated\nduring the 1930s before falling again during the early 1940s; but rapid growth\nstarted once again in the mid 1940s.\n\nIn the 1940s, particularly during World War II, the economy profited from the\nincreased export and delivery of weapons to Germany, France, the United\nKingdom, and other European countries. However, Switzerland's energy\nconsumption decreased rapidly. The co-operation of the banks with the Nazis\n(although they also co-operated extensively with the British and French) and\ntheir commercial relations with the Axis powers during the war were later\nsharply criticised, resulting in a short period of international isolation of\nSwitzerland. Switzerland's production facilities were largely undamaged by the\nwar, and afterwards both imports and exports grew rapidly.\n\nIn the 1950s, annual GDP growth averaged 5% and Switzerland's energy\nconsumption nearly doubled. Coal lost its rank as Switzerland's primary energy\nsource, as other imported fossil fuels, such as crude and refined oil and\nnatural and refined gas, increased.\n\nIn the 1960s, annual GDP growth averaged 4% and Switzerland's total energy\nconsumption nearly doubled again. By the end of the decade oil provided over\nthree-quarters of Switzerland's energy.\n\nIn the 1970s the GDP growth rate gradually declined from a peak of 6.5% in\n1970; GDP then contracted by 7.5% in 1975 and 1976. Switzerland became\nincreasingly dependent on oil imported from its main suppliers, the OPEC\ncartel. The 1973 international oil crisis caused Switzerland's energy\nconsumption to decrease in the years from 1973 to 1978. In 1974 there were\nthree nationwide car-free Sundays when private transport was prohibited as a\nresult of the oil supply shock. From 1977 onwards GDP grew again, although\nSwitzerland was also affected by the 1979 energy crisis which resulted in a\nshort-term decrease in Switzerland's energy consumption. In 1970 industry\nstill employed about 46% of the labor force, but during the economic recession\nof the 1970s the services sector grew to dominate the national economy. By\n1970 17.2% of the population and about one quarter of the work force were\nforeign nationals, though job losses during the economic recession decreased\nthis number.\n\nIn the 1980s, Switzerland's economy contracted by 1.3% in 1982 but grew\nsubstantially for the rest of the decade, with annual GDP growth between about\n3% and 4%, apart from 1986 and 1987 when growth decreased to 1.9% and 1.6%\nrespectively.\n\nSwitzerland's economy was marred by slow growth in the 1990s, having the\nweakest economic growth in Western Europe. The economy was affected by a\nthree-year recession from 1991 to 1993, when the economy contracted by 2%. The\ncontraction also became apparent in Switzerland's energy consumption and\nexport growth rates. Switzerland's economy averaged no appreciable increase\n(only 0.6% annually) in GDP.\n\nAfter enjoying unemployment rates lower than 1% before 1990, the three-year\nrecession also caused the unemployment rate to rise to its all-time peak of\n5.3% in 1997. In 2008, Switzerland was in second place among European\ncountries with populations above one million in terms of nominal and\npurchasing power parity GDP per capita, behind Norway (see list). Several\ntimes in the 1990s, real wages decreased since nominal wages could not keep up\nwith inflation. However, beginning in 1997, a global resurgence in currency\nmovement provided the necessary stimulus to the Swiss economy. It slowly\ngained momentum, and peaked in the year 2000 with 3.7% growth in real terms.",

After the worldwide stock market crashes in the\nwake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there were more announcements of false\nenterprise statistics[_clarification needed_] and exaggerated managers' wages.\nThe rate of GDP growth dropped to 1.2% in 2001; 0.4% in 2002; and minus 0.2%\nin 2003. This economic slowdown had a noticeable impact on the labour market.\n\nMany companies announced mass dismissals and thus the unemployment rate rose\nfrom its low of 1.6% in September 2000 to a peak of 4.3% in January 2004,\nalthough well below the European Union (EU) rate of 9.2% at the end of 2004.\n\nOn 10 November 2002 the economics magazine _Cash_ suggested five measures for\npolitical and economic institutions to implement to revive the Swiss economy:\n\n1\\. Private consumption should be promoted with decent wage increases. In\naddition to that, families with children should get discounts on their health\ninsurance.\n\n2\\. Switzerland's national bank should revive investments by lowering interest\nrates. Besides that, monetary institutions should increasingly credit\nconsumers[_clarification needed_] and offer cheaper land to be built on.\n\nEuro to Swiss Franc exchange rate. In 2022, the Swiss National Bank reported a\nrecord loss of CHF 132 billion ($142 billion), mostly on its holdings of the\nEuro currency.\n\n3\\. Switzerland's national bank was asked to devalue the Swiss Franc,\nespecially compared to the Euro.\n\n4\\. The government should implement the anti-cyclical measure of increasing\nbudget deficits. Government spending should increase in the infrastructure and\neducation sectors. Lowering taxes would make sense in order to promote private\nhousehold consumption.\n\n5\\. Flexible work schedules should be instituted, thus avoiding low demand\ndismissals.\n\nThese measures were applied with successful results while the government\nstrove for the _Magical Hexagon_ of full employment, social equality, economic\ngrowth, environmental quality, positive trade balance and price stability. The\nrebound which started in mid-2003 saw growth rate growth rate averaging 3%\n(2004 and 2005 saw a GDP growth of 2.5% and 2.6% respectively; for 2006 and\n2007, the rate was 3.6%).

Growth for 2010 was 2.6%\n\nThe stock market collapse of 2007-2009 deeply affected investment income\nearned abroad. This translated to a substantial fall in the surplus of the\ncurrent account balance. In 2006, Switzerland recorded a 15.1% per GDP\nsurplus. It went down to 9.1% in 2007 and further dropped to 1.8% in 2008. It\nrecovered in 2009 and 2010 with a surplus of 11.9% and 14.6% respectively.\nUnemployment peaked in December 2009 at 4.4%.

While some Swiss types are AOP\nrestricted, generic Emmentaler is produced around the world.\n\nSwitzerland is highly protective of its agricultural industry. High tariffs\nand extensive domestic subsidisations encourage domestic production, which\ncurrently produces about 60% of the food consumed in the country. Cheeses and\ndairy are emblematic products of Swiss agriculture. Wine is another.\n\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD), Switzerland is subsidising more than 70% of its agriculture compared\nto 35% in the EU. The _2007 Agricultural Program_ increased subsidies by CHF\n63 million to CHF 14.092 billion.\n\nProtectionism acts to promote domestic production, but not to reduce prices or\nthe cost of production, and there is no guarantee the increased domestic\nproduction is actually consumed internally; it may simply be exported, to the\nprofit of the producers. 90 to 100% of potatoes, vegetables, pork, veal,\ncattle and most milk products are produced in the country. Beyond that, Swiss\nagriculture meets 65% of the domestic food demand. In 2016 the Swiss\ngovernment spent about 5.5% of its total budget (over CHF 3.5 billion) on\nsupporting food production.\n\nThe first reform in agricultural policies was in 1993. Among other changes,\nsince 1998 Switzerland has linked the attribution of farm subsidies with the\nstrict observance of good environmental practice. Before farmers can apply for\nsubsidies, they must obtain certificates of environmental management systems\n(EMS) proving that they: \"make a balanced use of fertilizers; use at least 7%\nof their farmland as ecological compensation areas; regularly rotate crops;\nadopt appropriate measures to protect animals and soil; make limited and\ntargeted use of pesticides.\" 1,500 farms are driven out of business each year.\nBut the number of organic farms increased by 3.3 percent between 2003 and\n2004, and organic sales increased by 7 percent to $979 million. Moreover,\nSwiss consumers consider less important the drawback of higher prices for\norganic food compared to conventional locally produced food.",

      "• Switzerland is highly protective of its agricultural industry, employing high tariffs and extensive domestic subsidizations to encourage domestic production, which currently accounts for about 60% of the food consumed within the country.",
      "• Cheeses and dairy products are emblematic of Swiss agriculture, with Emmentaler cheese being a notable example; while some Swiss types of Emmentaler are AOP (Appellation d'Origine Protégée) restricted, generic Emmentaler cheese is produced globally.",
      "• Wine is another significant agricultural product in Switzerland, alongside dairy and cheese.",
      "• According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Switzerland subsidizes more than 70% of its agricultural sector, a figure that is notably higher than the 35% subsidy level found in the European Union.",
      "• The 2007 Agricultural Program increased agricultural subsidies by CHF 63 million, bringing the total subsidies to CHF 14.092 billion.",
      "• Swiss agricultural protectionism promotes domestic production but does not aim to reduce prices or production costs; increased domestic production is not necessarily consumed internally and may be exported, benefiting producers financially.",
      "• Between 90% and 100% of potatoes, vegetables, pork, veal, cattle, and most milk products consumed in Switzerland are produced domestically.",
      "• Overall, Swiss agriculture meets approximately 65% of the domestic food demand.",
      "• In 2016, the Swiss government allocated about 5.5% of its total budget, amounting to over CHF 3.5 billion, to support food production.",
      "• The first major reform in Swiss agricultural policies occurred in 1993, with significant changes implemented by 1998 linking farm subsidy eligibility to strict adherence to good environmental practices.",
      "• Farmers must obtain certificates of environmental management systems (EMS) before applying for subsidies, demonstrating compliance with criteria including balanced fertilizer use, dedicating at least 7% of farmland as ecological compensation areas, regular crop rotation, appropriate animal and soil protection measures, and limited, targeted pesticide use.",
      "• Approximately 1,500 farms exit the Swiss agricultural sector each year.",
      "• Between 2003 and 2004, the number of organic farms in Switzerland increased by 3.3%, while organic food sales rose by 7%, reaching $979 million.",
      "• Swiss consumers tend to place less importance on the higher prices of organic food compared to conventional locally produced food, indicating a preference or willingness to pay for organic products despite cost differences."
