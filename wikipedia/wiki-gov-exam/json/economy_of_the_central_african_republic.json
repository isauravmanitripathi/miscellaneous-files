The importance of foodcrops over\nexported cash crops is illustrated by the fact that the total production of\ncassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between c. 200,000\nand 300,000 tons a year, while the production of cotton, the principal\nexported cash crop, ranges from c. 25,000 to 45,000 tons a year.\n\nFoodcrops are not exported in large quantities but they still constitute the\nprincipal cash crops of the country because Central Africans derive far more\nincome from the periodic sale of surplus foodcrops than from exported cash\ncrops such as cotton or coffee. Many rural and urban women also transform some\nfoodcrops into alcoholic drinks such as sorghum beer or hard liquor and derive\nconsiderable income from the sale of these drinks. Much of the income derived\nfrom the sale of foods and alcohol is not \"on the books\" and thus is not\nconsidered in calculating per capita income, which is one reason why official\nfigures for per capita income are not accurate in the case of the CAR.\n\nThe per capita income of the CAR is often listed as being around $400 a year,\nsaid to be one of the lowest in the world, but this figure is based mostly on\nreported sales of exports and largely ignores the more important but\nunregistered sale of foods, locally produced alcohol, diamonds, ivory,\nbushmeat, and traditional medicines, for example. The informal economy of the\nCAR is more important than the formal economy for most Central Africans.\n\nCentral African Republic produced in 2019:\n\n* 730 thousand tons of cassava;\n* 511 thousand tons of yam (7th largest producer in the world);\n* 143 thousand tons of peanut;\n* 140 thousand tons of taro;\n* 138 thousand tons of banana;\n* 120 thousand tons of sugar cane;\n* 90 thousand tons of maize;\n* 87 thousand tons of plantain;\n* 75 thousand tons of vegetable;\n* 36 thousand tons of orange;\n* 30 thousand tons of sorghum;\n* 21 thousand tons of cotton;\n* 19 thousand tons of pumpkin;\n* 17 thousand tons of pineapple;\n* 12 thousand tons of mango;\n* 10 thousand tons of millet;\n* 10 thousand tons of coffee;\n* 8.5 thousand tons of avocado;\n* 6.7 thousand tons of sesame seed;\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.",

Economic mismanagement, poor infrastructure, a limited\ntax base, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions have led\nto deficits in both its budget and external trade. Its debt burden is\nconsiderable, and the country has seen a decline in per capita gross national\nproduct over the last 40 years.\n\nImportant constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked\nposition, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a\nlegacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies. The 50% devaluation of the\ncurrencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed\neffects on the CAR's economy. Diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports\nincreased, leading an estimated rise of GDP of 7% in 1994 and nearly 5% in\n1995.\n\nMilitary rebellions and social unrest in 1996 were accompanied by widespread\ndestruction of property and a drop in GDP of 2%. Ongoing violence between the\ngovernment and rebel military groups over pay issues, living conditions, and\npolitical representation has destroyed many businesses in the capital and\nreduced tax revenues for the government.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an Extended Structure\nAdjustment Facility in 1998.
