Nevertheless, the country's gross\ndomestic product (GDP) in 1986 was approximately US$3.4 billion, or roughly\nUS$1,000 per capita, ranking Paraguay only ahead of Bolivia among countries of\nSouth America. Paraguay was the most agricultural economy of South America,\nand that sector influenced the performance of virtually every other sector of\nthe economy. The over dependence on agricultural economy and low tax\ncollections deteriorated the already wide gap wealth distribution. The extreme\npoverty increased from 16% to 20% during 2001 to 2012, even as the economy\ngrew. By 2013, it has a human development index of 0.669 which is even lower\nthan Bolivia.\n\nThe Paraguayan economic miracle of the 1970s came to a halt in 1982 because of\nthe completion of construction at Itaipú, lower commodity prices for cotton\nand soybeans, and a global recession. The economy recovered in 1984 and 1985,\nstagnated in 1986, and continued to expand in 1987 and 1988. Despite its rapid\ngrowth, the Paraguayan economy became increasingly dependent on soybeans and\ncotton for exports and overall economic dynamism. These two crops, however,\nremained subject to external price fluctuations and local weather conditions,\nboth of which varied considerably.\n\nEconomic growth in the post-World War II period occurred in the context of\npolitical stability characterized by authoritarian rule and patronage\npolitics. Government economic policies deviated little from 1954 to the late\n1980s, consistently favoring a strong private-enterprise economy with a large\nrole for foreign investment. Unlike most other Latin American economies, in\nParaguay import tariffs were generally low, fiscal deficits manageable, and\nexchange rates not overvalued. These trends faltered in the 1980s as the\ngovernment took a more active part in industry, deficits rose, and the\nnational currency was generally overvalued and devalued numerous times.\nThroughout the post-World War II era, Paraguay had no personal income tax, and\ngovernment revenues as a percentage of GDP were among the lowest in the world.\n\nDespite the sustained economic growth that marked the postwar period, the\ndistribution of economic benefits was highly inequitable. Although GDP\nexpanded rapidly in the 1970s, most economists estimated that income\ndistribution worsened during the decade. Government spending on social\nservices was particularly lacking. Paraguay's poverty was mostly a rural\nphenomenon, which increasingly involved competition for land in the eastern\nregion near the Brazilian border, especially in the departments\n(administrative divisions) of Alto Paraná, Canendiyú, and Caaguazú.\nNonetheless, land tenure was not generally the acute social problem it was in\nmany developing countries.\n\nAlthough Paraguay faced significant obstacles to future economic development,\nit displayed extraordinary potential. Paraguay contained little oil and no\nprecious metals or sea coasts, but the country was self-sufficient in many\nareas and was endowed with fertile land, dense forests, and swift rivers. The\nprocess of opening up the eastern border region to economic activity and\ncontinued agricultural expansion was expected to effect rapid changes in once-\nisolated Paraguay. Likewise, the development of a series of hydroelectric\nplants along the Río Paraná linked Paraguay to its neighbors and provided it\naccess to cherished energy resources and badly needed export revenues.\nFinally, road construction united different departments of Paraguay and\nprovided the country its first access to the Atlantic Ocean via Brazil. These\nprocesses of infrastructure development, hydroelectric expansion, agricultural\ncolonization, and a cash crop explosion allowed Paraguay by the late 1980s to\nbegin to tap its potential",

The\nSpanish, however, found little of economic interest in their colony, which had\nno precious metals and no sea coasts. The typical feudal Spanish economic\nsystem did not dominate colonial Paraguay, although the encomienda system was\nestablished. Economic relations were distinguished by the reducciones\n(reductions or townships) that were established by Jesuit missionaries from\nthe early seventeenth century until the 1760s. The incorporation of Indians\ninto these Jesuit agricultural communes laid the foundation for an\nagriculture-based economy that survived in the late twentieth century.\n\nThree years after Paraguay overthrew Spanish authority and gained its\nindependence, the country's economy was controlled by the autarkic policies of\nJosé Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia (1814–40), who closed the young nation's\nborders to virtually all international trade. Landlocked, isolated, and\nunderpopulated, Paraguay structured its economy around a centrally\nadministered agricultural sector, extensive cattle grazing, and inefficient\nshipbuilding and textile industries. After the demise of de Francia,\ngovernment policies focused on expanding international trade and stimulating\neconomic development. The government built several roads and authorized\nBritish construction of a railroad.\n\nThe War of the Triple Alliance (1865–70) fundamentally changed the Paraguayan\neconomy. Economic resources were employed in and destroyed by the war effort.\nParaguay was occupied by its enemies in 1870; the countryside was in virtual\nruin, the labor force was decimated, peasants were pushed into the environs of\nAsunción from the east and south, and the modernization of the preceding three\ndecades was undone. Sleepy, self-sufficient Paraguay, whose advances in\nagriculture and quality of life had been the envy of many in the Southern\nCone, became the most backward nation in that subregion.\n\nTo pay its substantial war debt, Paraguay sold large tracts of land to\nforeigners, mostly Argentines. These large land sales established the base of\nthe present-day land tenure system, which is characterized by a skewed\ndistribution of land. Unlike most of its neighbors, however, Paraguay's\neconomy was controlled not by a traditional, landed elite, but by foreign\ncompanies. Many Paraguayans grew crops and worked as wage laborers on\nlatifundios (large landholdings) typically owned by foreigners.\n\nThe late 1800s and the early 1900s saw a slow rebuilding of ports, roads, the\nrailroad, farms, cattle stock, and the labor force. The country was slowly\nbeing repopulated by former Brazilian soldiers who had fought in the War of\nthe Triple Alliance, and Paraguay's government encouraged European\nimmigration. Although few in number, British, German, Italian, and Spanish\ninvestors and farmers helped modernize the country. Argentine, Brazilian, and\nBritish companies in the late 1800s purchased some of Paraguay's best land and\nstarted the first large-scale production of agricultural goods for export. One\nArgentine company, whose owner had purchased 15 percent of the immense Chaco\nregion, processed massive quantities of tannin, which were extracted from the\nbark of the Chaco's ubiquitous quebracho (break-axe) hardwood. Large\nquantities of the extract were used by the region's thriving hide industry.\nAnother focus of large-scale agro-processing was the yerba maté bush, whose\nleaves produced the potent tea that is the national beverage. Tobacco farming\nalso flourished. Beginning in 1904, foreign investment increased as a\nsuccession of Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) administrations in Paraguay\nmaintained a staunch laissez-faire policy.\n\nThe period of steady economic recovery came to an abrupt halt in 1932 as the\ncountry entered another devastating war. This time Paraguay fought Bolivia\nover possession of the Chaco and rumors of oil deposits. The war ended in 1935\nafter extensive human losses on both sides, and war veterans led the push for\ngeneral social reform. During the 1930s and 1940s, the state passed labor\nlaws, implemented agrarian reform, and assumed a role in modernization,\ninfluenced in part by the leadership of Juan Perón in Argentina and Getúlio\nVargas in Brazil. The 1940 constitution, for example, rejected the laissez-\nfaire approach of previous Liberal governments. Reformist policies, however,\ndid not enjoy a consensus, and by 1947 the country had entered into a civil\nwar, which in turn initiated a period of economic chaos that lasted until the\nmid-1950s. During this period, Paraguay experienced the worst inflation in all\nof Latin America, averaging over 100 percent annually in the 1950s.\n\nAfter centuries of isolation, two devastating regional wars, and a civil war,\nin 1954 Paraguay entered a period of prolonged political and economic\nstability under the authoritarian rule of Alfredo Stroessner. Stroessner's\neconomic policies took a middle course between social reform, desarrollismo,\nand laissez-faire, all in the context of patronage politics. Relative to\nprevious governments, Stroessner took a fairly active role in the economy but\nreserved productive activities for the local and foreign private sectors. The\nnew government's primary economic task was to arrest the country's rampant and\nspiraling price instability. In 1955 Stroessner fired the country's finance\nminister, who was unwilling to implement reforms, and in 1956 accepted an\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilization plan that abolished export\nduties, lowered import tariffs, restricted credit, devalued the currency, and\nimplemented strict austerity measures. Although the sacrifice was high, the\nplan helped bring economic stability to Paraguay. Labor unions retaliated with\na major strike in 1958, but the new government, now firmly established,\nquelled the uprising and forced many labor leaders into exile; most of them\nremained there in the late 1980s.\n\nBy the 1960s, the economy was on a path of modest but steady economic growth.\nReal GDP growth during the 1960s averaged 4.2 percent a year, under the Latin\nAmerican average of 5.7 percent but well ahead of the chaotic economy of the\ntwo previous decades. As part of the United States-sponsored Alliance for\nProgress, the government was encouraged to expand its planning apparatus for\neconomic development. With assistance from the Organization of American States\n(OAS), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United Nations\nEconomic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), in 1962 Paraguay established the\nTechnical Planning Secretariat (Secretaría Técnica de Planificación—STP), the\nmajor economic planning arm of the government. By 1965 the country had its\nfirst National Economic Plan, a two-year plan for 1965–66. This was followed\nby another two-year plan (1967–68) and then a series of five-year plans. Five-\nyear plans—only general policy statements—were not typically adhered to or\nachieved and played a minimal role in Paraguay's economic growth and\ndevelopment. Compared with most Latin American countries, Paraguay had a small\npublic sector. Free enterprise dominated the economy, export promotion was\nfavored over import substitution, agriculture continued to dominate industry,\nand the economy remained generally open to international trade and market\nmechanisms.\n\nIn an economic sense, the 1970s constituted Paraguay's miracle decade. Real\nGDP grew at over 8 percent a year and exceeded 10 percent from 1976 to 1981—a\nfaster growth rate than in any other economy in Latin America. Four coinciding\ndevelopments accounted for Paraguay's rapid growth in the 1970s. The first was\nthe completion of the road from Asunción to Puerto Presidente Stroessner and\nto Brazilian seaports on the Atlantic, ending traditional dependence on access\nthrough Argentina and opening the east to many for the first time. The second\nwas the signing of the Treaty of Itaipú with Brazil in 1973. Beyond the\nobvious economic benefits of such a massive project, Itaipú helped to create a\nnew mood of optimism in Paraguay about what a small, isolated country could\nattain. The third event was land colonization, which resulted from the\navailability of land, the existence of economic opportunity, the increased\nprice of crops, and the newly gained accessibility of the eastern border\nregion. Finally, the skyrocketing price of soybeans and cotton led farmers to\nquadruple the number of hectares planted with these two crops. As the 1970s\nprogressed, soybeans and cotton came to dominate the country's employment,\nproduction, and exports.\n\nThese developments shared responsibility for establishing thriving economic\nrelations between Paraguay and the world's sixth largest economy, Brazil.\nContraband trade became the dominant economic force on the border between the\ntwo countries, with Puerto Presidente Stroessner serving as the hub of such\nsmuggling activities. Observers contended that contraband was accepted by many\nParaguayan government officials, some of whom were reputed to have benefited\nhandsomely. Many urban dwellers' shelves were stocked with contraband luxury\nitems.\n\nThe Paraguayan government's emphasis on industrial activity increased\nnoticeably in the 1970s. One of the most important components of the new\nindustrial push was Law 550, also referred to as Law 550/75 or the Investment\nPromotion Law for Social and Economic Development. Law 550 opened Paraguay's\ndoors even further to foreign investors by providing income-tax breaks, duty-\nfree capital imports, and additional incentives for companies that invested in\npriority areas, especially the Chaco. Law 550 was successful. Investments by\ncompanies in the United States, Europe, and Japan comprised, according to some\nestimates, roughly a quarter of new investment. Industrial policies also\nencouraged the planning of more state-owned enterprises, including ones\ninvolved in producing ethanol, cement, and steel.\n\nMuch of Paraguay's rural population, however, missed out on the economic\ndevelopment. Back roads remained inadequate, preventing peasants from bringing\nproduce to markets. Social services, such as schools and clinics, were\nseverely lacking. Few people in the countryside had access to potable water,\nelectricity, bank credit, or public transportation. As in other economies that\nunderwent rapid growth, income distribution was believed to have worsened in\nParaguay during the 1970s in both relative and absolute terms. By far the\ngreatest problem that the rural population faced, however, was competition for\nland. Multinational agribusinesses, Brazilian settlers, and waves of\nParaguayan colonists rapidly increased the competition for land in the eastern\nborder region. Those peasants who lacked proper titles to the lands they\noccupied were pushed to more marginal areas; as a result, an increasing number\nof rural clashes occurred, including some with the government.",

Manufactured exports, by most definitions, accounted\nfor less than 5 percent of total exports; when semiprocessed agricultural\nproducts were included, however, that figure reached 77 percent. The growth of\nthe country's manufacturing industries was hampered by numerous structural\nobstacles. These included a small internal market, limited physical\ninfrastructure, costly access to seaports, a historical lack of energy\nproduction, and the openness of Paraguay's economy to the more industrialized\neconomies of Brazil and Argentina. Another significant factor was the ubiquity\nand profitability of smuggling operations, which encouraged importing and\nreexporting rather than production.\n\nParaguay's earliest manufacturing industries processed hides and leather from\nits abundant cattle and tannin from quebracho trees. Small-scale\nmanufacturing, especially textiles, flourished under the Francia dictatorship,\nwhen the nation's borders were closed. The War of the Triple Alliance,\nhowever, devastated what little industry and infrastructure the country had,\ncausing Paraguay to enter the twentieth century as an almost completely\nagricultural society. Land sales to foreigners stimulated increased\nagricultural processing in the early twentieth century, including meat packing\nand the processing of flour, oilseeds, sugar, beer, and pectin extract. After\nthe early 1900s, small-scale manufacturing in all subsectors grew at a slow,\nbut steady pace, with some of the fastest growth occurring because of the\nshortages during World War II.\n\nThe government's role in promoting industry increased in the postwar era, and\nin 1955 the Stroessner government undertook the country's first industrial\ncensus. Over the next twenty years, the government enacted a number of\nindustrial incentive measures, the most important of which was Law 550. Law\n550 promoted exportoriented industries or those that would save foreign\nexchange. It also provided liberal fiscal incentives for companies to develop\nspecific areas of the country, especially the departments of Alto Paraguay,\nNueva Asunción, Chaco, and Boquerón. Incentives for business were related\nmostly to import-duty exemptions, but they included a variety of tax breaks\nand placed no restrictions on foreign ownership. Approximately one-fourth of\nall new manufacturing investment from 1975 to 1985 was registered under Law\n550. Most foreign investments originated from Brazil, West Germany, the United\nStates, Portugal, and Argentina in that order of importance. The dynamic\nprocesses of agricultural colonization and hydroelectric development, combined\nwith such attractive industrial incentives, caused manufacturing to grow at an\nunprecedented rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nUnlike many other Latin American governments, which followed an import-\nsubstitution industrial policy, the Paraguayan government had played a\nminimalist role in the economy through most of the postwar era, curtailing\nimport tariffs and maintaining a realistic exchange rate. In the 1980s,\nhowever, Paraguay's exchange rate became overvalued and several state-owned\nheavy industry plants became operational.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the major subsectors of manufacturing were food, beverages,\nand tobacco; textiles, clothing, leather, and shoes; wood and related\nproducts; and chemicals, petroleum, and plastics. Despite some increases in\nheavy industry in the economy during the 1970s and 1980s, Paraguayan industry\nwas generally small-scale. Manufacturing production remained focused on\nconsumer goods, and capital goods comprised under 5 percent of industrial\noutput. In fact, in the 1980s Paraguay did not contain even one of Latin\nAmerica's 1,000 largest companies, at least some of which were found in most\nother countries in the region. Virtually every subsector of Paraguay's\nmanufacturing was characterized by numerous small- to medium-sized firms and a\nfew large firms, which often were foreign owned. Most companies operated well\nbelow their capacity.\n\nThe food, beverages, and tobacco subsector has been the core manufacturing\nactivity throughout Paraguay's history. In the late 1980s, this subsector\ncontinued to dominate, accounting for about 45 percent of industrial activity,\ndepending on agricultural output in a given year. Agro-processing involved a\nlarge number of small, inefficient, and often family-run firms as well as a\nsmall number of large, efficient, and usually foreign-owned firms. The larger\nfirms produced only the most lucrative items, such as oilseeds, meats, and\nvarious beverages, often for export. Some of the most common small-scale\nproducers manufactured milled items, baked goods, sugar and molasses, dairy\nproducts, candy, manioc flour, vinegar, coffee, and tobacco. Along with raw\nagricultural produce, processed and semiprocessed food generated nearly all of\nthe country's exports in the late 1980s. But, as with other manufacturing\nsubsectors, the profitability of the food subsector often was impaired by\ncontraband items from Brazil and Argentina, such as flour, meat, or dairy\nproducts. Paraguayan goods crossed borders unofficially, as well, thus\nlowering official exports.\n\nThe second most important manufacturing activity also relied on agricultural\ninputs for its base. Utilizing Paraguay's rich endowment of hardwood trees,\nthe wood subsector represented about 15 percent of all industrial activity and\ncontributed over 8 percent of exports in the 1980s. The most voluminous wood\nexport was lumber, which was produced by hundreds of small sawmills throughout\nthe central and eastern border regions. In addition to saw wood, mills also\nproduced a variety of milled wood, plywood, chipboard, and parquet flooring.\nAlthough the country cut and processed only a fraction of its hundreds of\nspecies, Paraguayan wood was known for its quality. The country also contained\nseveral small paper companies and one large paper and cardboard factory\nlocated at Villeta.\n\nTextiles, clothing, leather, and shoes comprised the third largest\nmanufacturing subsector. These industries were traditional, grounded in the\nnation's abundance of inputs like cotton fibers, cattle hides, and tannin\nextract. The subsector accounted for about 10 percent of all manufacturing.\nThe textile industry performed spinning, weaving, and dyeing operations and\nproduced finished fabrics that amounted to over 100 million tons in 1986. Most\nfabrics were derived from cotton fibers, but a growing number of synthetic and\nwool fibers also were produced. Textile production provided inputs to\napproximately sixty clothing firms that operated under capacity and were\ngenerally inefficient. As with so many other manufacturers, clothing companies\nmet stiff competition from widespread unregistered imports, which often\noriginated in Asia and typically entered across the Brazilian border. The\nleather industry was characterized by 200 or so small tanneries dotting the\nParaguayan countryside. In addition, many medium and two large tanneries\nfashioned leather goods. The leather industry operated at only about 40\npercent of capacity, however. The shoe industry comprised a few hundred small\nworkshops and a dozen or so mediumsized firms, which produced some 5 million\npairs of leather and synthetic shoes a year.\n\nThe processing of petroleum, chemicals, and plastics repeated an increasing\nactivity. In the late 1980s, this subsector represented less than 5 percent of\nindustrial activity, but its share of manufacturing output was expanding\nbecause of the growth of heavy industry in Paraguay, especially industry\nrelated to the energy sector. The country also produced fertilizers,\nindustrial gases, tanning chemicals, varnishes, and detergents. In 1987 a\ngroup of Japanese investors was considering the construction of a new\nfertilizer plant with a 70,000-ton capacity per year. Since the early 1980s,\nethanol was being produced in large quantities, and the government was\nconsidering producing methanol. Also processed were paints, soaps, candles,\nperfumes, and pharmaceuticals. One of Paraguay's fastest growing industries\nwas the new, relatively modern plastics subsector, which supplied a wide\nvariety of goods to the local market.",

    "text": "Soybeans and silos on a farm in rural Paraguay\n\nThe most important component of the Paraguayan economy is the farming sector,\nwhich contributed 27% to GDP in 2006. The participation of commerce was 20.2%,\nand that of other services, including government, 38.4%. Industry's part\n(including mining and construction) was about 20%.\n\nAfter years of economic crisis, between 1999 and 2002, the Paraguayan economy\ngrew at between 2.9 and 4.1% per year from 2003 to 2006. For 2007, the\nestimated growth is about 6.4%. Inflation in 2007 reached 6.0%.\n\nMost enterprises are small, micro and individual ones, including subsistence\njobs like street vendors. Only 4% of the Paraguayan labor force works in\ncompanies with more than 50 employees.\n\nIn June 2007 external foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$2153 million,\nand the foreign official debt US$2154 million, close to parity. The fiscal\nsurplus is provisionally reported as 0.5% of GDP in 2006 and 2007. Paraguay's\neconomy (GDP) grew 5.8% in 2008, fastest growing sector being agriculture with\n10.5% growth.\n\nCattle on cleared land in the Chaco Commerce in Ciudad del Este, on the border\nwith Brazil\n\nAgriculture accounts for about 20 percent of Paraguay's annual gross domestic\nproduct (25 percent in 2004) and virtually all of the country's export\nearnings. It is Paraguay's largest and most consistent source of employment,\nemploying about 45 percent of the working population. In addition to those\nengaged in the formal agricultural sector, thousands of Paraguayan families\nsurvive through subsistence farming.\n\nParaguay produces enough basic food to be largely self-sufficient. Corn,\ncassava, and wheat are the main food crops for local consumption. The global\nsurge in grain prices 2007/2008 was a major impulse for the agricultural\nsector. Wheat cultivation expanded, so did rice. Most significant was the\nincrease of soy production. In 2004 Paraguay had about 1.6 million hectares\ndedicated to genetically modified (GM) crops. Export value of soy and its\nderivates increased from US$1,25 billion in 2007 to US$2,54billion in 2008\n\nParaguay's eastern plains as well as the Chaco support the country's dairy and\nranching industry. Behind soybeans, beef exports make up a significant part of\nParaguay's agriculture sector. Additionally, Paraguay produces an adequate\nsupply of beef, pork, and dairy products to meet domestic needs. The discovery\nof cases of foot-and-mouth disease in 2002 and 2003 led to a ban on Paraguayan\nbeef in many countries. However, in 2004 Paraguay's meat production and\nexports rebounded. As a result of rising international prices and the recovery\nof important markets like Chile or Russia, Paraguay's meat exports rose to\nUS$143 million in 2004. They reached US$353 million in 2007 and US$597 million\nin 2008. Presently, Paraguay has a national herd numbering between 9 and 10\nmillion head of cattle.\n\nParaguay's forests adequately meet domestic needs for lumber and fuelwood.\nHowever, logging for export, both legally and illegally, has thinned\nParaguay's once abundant forests, resulting in a ban on the export of logs\nsince the 1970s. More than 90% of the native rainforest of Paraguay's eastern\nhalf have been lost between 1975 and 2008. In the western half, the Chaco,\nvirgin forest is lost to cattle ranching at an annual rate of more than\n200.000 hectare (2008). Sustainable wood cultivation is now on the increase.\n\nThe fishing industry in Paraguay exists almost solely to meet domestic demand.",

The dam is located on the Paraguay River,\nand Paraguay and Brazil evenly share the ownership, operation, and electricity\ngenerated.

In 2007 electricity production rose\nto 70 TWh, and exports reached 64 TWh which put Paraguay in second place\nworldwide as an exporter of electrical power (And in the first place as a net\nexporter since France, the Number one exporter in the World with 67 TWh, also\nimports 10 TWh, while Paraguay does not import any).\n\nParaguay has no oil reserves; it relies on imported oil to meet its limited\nneed for oil-produced energy.

Brazil was the leading source of imports to Paraguay (24.3\npercent), followed by the United States (22.3 percent), Argentina (16.2\npercent), China (9.9 percent), and Hong Kong (5 percent). Experts note that\nimport statistics are difficult to confirm for Paraguay because as much as\nhalf of all imports are illegally re-exported to Argentina or Brazil. Imports\nfrom Mercosur countries continue to rise, up to 57 percent in 2003.\n\nParaguay's export revenues totaled about US$2.9 billion in 2004.
