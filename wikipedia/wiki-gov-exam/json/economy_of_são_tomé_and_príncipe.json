    "text": "Geologists estimate that the Gulf of Guinea zone (Niger Delta province) holds\nmore than 10 billion barrels (1.6 km3) of oil, although no reserves have yet\nbeen proven. A joint oil project with Nigeria in 2005 is likely to\ncontribute[_when?_] $50 million of revenues to the government from the\nexploration licence signing fees. This represents four times government\nrevenues in 2004. São Tomé is optimistic that significant petroleum\ndiscoveries under the exploration licence are forthcoming, though no crude oil\nnor natural gas has been found as of 2021."

At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned\nplantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control\nof these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises.\nThe dominant crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of exports.\nOther export crops include copra, palm kernels, and coffee.\n\n*   *   *   *"
