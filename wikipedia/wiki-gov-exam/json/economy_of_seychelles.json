Oil-prone source rocks containing Type II kerogen in coaly deltaic shales of the Middle Jurassic and in marine shales of the Upper Jurassic;\n2. Mixed source rocks bearing Type II/III kerogen in deltaic marine shales of the Lower Cretaceous that are II correlative of oil-generating shales in Somalia;\n3. Gas-prone sources containing Type I kerogen in Upper Triassic fluvial shales and Paleocene marine shales, the latter being correlative of oil and gas generating source rocks of the Deep Continental Shelf trend of the Bombay High Oil Province offshore west India;\n4. Evidence of hydrocarbon generation and migration with well shows, such as 0.7 ml benzene in DST-1 of Reith Bank-1, 10,010 ppm of 99.8% n-C4 headspace gas coincident with as small fault in the same well and 20% petrol vapours at an immature level of volcanics in Owen Bank A-1;\n5. Clastic reservoirs with measured porosities up to 22% in the Early-Middle Jurassic;\n6. Sealing lithologies occur both locally in syn-rift, and regionally in post-rift sequences;\n7. An extensive seismic dataset, plus a variety of remote sensing data have been collected which bolster the well data by confirming the presence of:\n8. A variety of trapping styles, dominated by tilted fault blocks, stratigraphic pinchouts and reefs;\n9. Multiple heating events, with the principal event post-dating trap formation; and\n10. Hydrocarbon generation and migration with the presence of: a) numerous DHIs on seismic, including gas chimneys, flat spots, bright spots, phase changes and chemosynthetic reefs; b) gas sniffer anomalies, involving ethane/iso-butane in the southeast and propane/normal butane/total hydrocarbon in the north and northeast; c) UV fluorescence anomalies, especially over the wells and in the southeast; and d) 4 types of beach-stranded tar that correlate to the local source rock stratigraphy.\n\nHowever, to date all exploratory and stratigraphic test wells (a total of 9\nsince the 1970s) in the Seychelles have failed to find commercial\nhydrocarbons. The most recent wildcat by Enterprise Oil in 1995 detected gas\nbut failed to find hydrocarbons.\n\nSeveral oil and gas exploration companies are active in the Seychelles\noffshore. These include East African Exploration (EAX) (a subsidiary of\nAfren), Avana Petroleum (a subsidiary of Vanoil Energy) and WHL Energy.\n\nBeginning at the turn of the millennium the Seychelles Petroleum Company\n(SEPEC) started to develop the first fleet of modern petroleum double-hull\ntankers, with five vessels, which was completed by late 2007/early 2008 with\nthe possibility to build more in the near future. The Seychelles President\nclaims that this has opened the door to a new industry for his country and\nencouraged economic growth by further removing over-reliance on traditional\ntrades like fisheries and tourism, which is now falling rapidly as the\ncountry's main income but nevertheless, has experienced significant growth in\nrecent years.\n\nThe country has also increased its capacity for wind power, with windfarms on\nRomainville Island.",
