    "text": "The **economy of South Africa** is the largest economy in Africa. It is a\nmixed economy, emerging market, and upper-middle-income economy, and one of\nonly eight such countries in Africa. The economy is the most industrialised,\ntechnologically advanced, and diversified in Africa.\n\nFollowing 1996, at the end of over twelve years of international sanctions,\nSouth Africa's nominal gross domestic product (GDP) almost tripled to a peak\nof US$416 billion in 2011. In the same period, foreign exchange reserves\nincreased from US$3 billion to nearly US$50 billion, creating a diversified\neconomy with a growing and sizable middle class, within three decades of\nending apartheid.\n\nAlthough the natural resource extraction industry remains one of the largest\nin the country with an annual contribution to the GDP of US$13.5 billion, the\neconomy of South Africa has diversified since the end of apartheid,\nparticularly towards services. In 2019, the financial industry contributed\nUS$41.4 billion to South Africa's GDP.\n\nIn 2021, South Africa-based financial institutions managed more than US$1.41\ntrillion in assets. The total market capitalization of the Johannesburg Stock\nExchange is US$1.28 trillion as of October 2021.\n\nThe state-owned enterprises of South Africa play a significant role in the\ncountry's economy, with the government owning a share in around 700 SOEs\ninvolved in a wide array of important industries. In 2016 according to\nbusiness executives, the top five challenges to doing business in the country\nwere inefficient government bureaucracy, restrictive labour regulations, a\nshortage of skilled workers for some high-tech industries, political\ninstability, and corruption.\n\nOn the other hand, the country's banking sector was rated as a strongly\npositive feature of the economy. The nation is among the G20, and is the only\nAfrican country that is a permanent member of the group.\n\nSouth Africa is a popular location for offshoring, with many international\ncompanies relocating operations or services to the country. In 2025, Robert\nWalters plc found that 60% of business leaders ranked South Africa as the most\nattractive country for offshoring, surpassing other popular regions by a large\nmargin. Among the top reasons for offshoring in South Africa were access to\nskilled talent, retained earnings, strong English proficiency, time zone\nalignment with major markets, and a growing reputation for business and tech\nservices.\n\nThe main industry that has shown considerable growth in offshoring activities\nto South Africa is \"Tech and IT\", which accounts for 53% of new roles. This is\nfollowed by categories \"customer service and support\", \"finance and\naccounting\", and \"human resources and recruitment\". South Africa's combination\nof skilled talent, strong infrastructure, and alignment with international\nbusiness practices, makes it a strategic location for building global business\ncapabilities."

    "text": "The formal economy of South Africa has its beginnings in the arrival of Dutch\nsettlers in 1652, originally sent by the Dutch East India Company to establish\na provisioning station for passing ships. As the colony increased in size,\nwith the arrival of Huguenots and German colonists, some of the colonists were\nset free to pursue commercial farming, leading to the dominance of agriculture\nin the economy.[_citation needed_]\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the British annexed the colony. This led to\nthe Great Trek, spreading farming deeper into the mainland, as well as the\nestablishment of the independent Afrikaner Republics of the Transvaal and the\nOrange Free State.\n\nIn 1870 diamonds were discovered in Kimberley, while in 1886 some of the\nworld's largest gold deposits were discovered in the Witwatersrand region of\nTransvaal, quickly transforming the economy into a resource-dominated one. The\nBritish annexed the area as a result of the Second Boer War which saw the\ndeployment of scorched earth tactics against Boer non-combatants. South Africa\nalso entered a period of industrialization during this time, including the\norganization of the first South African trade unions.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe country soon started putting laws distinguishing between different races\nin place. In 1948 the National Party won the national elections, and\nimmediately started implementing an even stricter race-based policy named\nApartheid, in an attempt to shelter the original white society from a never-\nending increase in the black population. The policy was widely criticised and\nled to crippling sanctions being placed against the country in the 1980s.\n\nSouth Africa held its first non-racial elections in 1994, leaving the newly\nall-African elected African National Congress (ANC) government the daunting\ntask of trying to restore order to an economy harmed by sanctions, while also\nintegrating the previously disadvantaged segment of the population into it.\n\nThe government refrained from resorting to economic populism. Inflation was\nbrought down, public finances were stabilised, and some foreign capital was\nattracted. However, growth was still subpar. At the start of 2000, then\nPresident Thabo Mbeki vowed to promote economic growth and foreign investment\nby relaxing restrictive labour laws, stepping up the pace of privatisation,\nraising governmental spending and cutting interest rates sharply from 1998\nlevels. His policies faced strong opposition from organised labour. From 2004\nonward economic growth picked up significantly; both employment and capital\nformation increased.\n\nIn April 2009, amid fears that South Africa would soon join much of the rest\nof the world in the late-2000s recession, Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni\nand Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel differed on the matter: whereas Manuel\nforesaw a quarter of economic growth, Mboweni predicted further decline:\n\"technically,\" he said, \"that's a recession.\" In 2009 the Nobel-Prize-winning\neconomist Joseph Stiglitz warned South Africa that inflation targeting should\nbe a secondary concern amid the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSouth Africa, unlike other emerging markets, has struggled through the late\n2000s recession, and the recovery has been largely led by private and public\nconsumption growth, while export volumes and private investment have yet to\nfully recover. The long-term potential growth rate of South Africa under the\ncurrent policy environment has been estimated at 3.5%. Per capita GDP growth\nhas proved mediocre, though improving, growing by 1.6% a year from 1994 to\n2009, and by 2.2% over the 2000–09 decade, compared to world growth of 3.1%\nover the same period.\n\nThe high levels of unemployment, at over 25%, and inequality are considered by\nthe government and most South Africans to be the most salient economic\nproblems facing the country. These issues, and others linked to them such as\ncrime, have in turn hurt investment and growth, consequently having a negative\nfeedback effect on employment. Crime is considered a major or very severe\nconstraint on investment by 30% of enterprises in South Africa, putting crime\namong the four most frequently mentioned constraints.\n\nIn April 2017, political tensions in the country arose over the sacking of\nnine cabinet members including Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan by the\npresident Jacob Zuma. The finance minister was seen as central to efforts to\nrestore confidence in South Africa. As a result of the tensions, S&P Global\ncut South Africa's credit rating to junk status on Monday 3 April 2017. Fitch\nRatings followed suit on Friday 7 April 2017 and cut the country's credit\nstatus to the sub-investment grade of BBB−. The South African rand lost more\nthan 11% in the week following the cabinet reshuffling."

It was the world's 12th largest producer of\nuranium in 2018.\n\nMining has been the main driving force behind the history and development of\nAfrica's most advanced economy. Large-scale and profitable mining started with\nthe discovery of a diamond on the banks of the Orange River in 1867 by Erasmus\nJacobs and the subsequent discovery and exploitation of the Kimberley pipes a\nfew years later. Gold rushes to Pilgrim's Rest and Barberton were precursors\nto the biggest discovery of all, the Main Reef/Main Reef Leader on Gerhardus\nOosthuizen's farm Langlaagte, Portion C, in 1886, the Witwatersrand Gold Rush\nand the subsequent rapid development of the goldfield there, the biggest of\nthem all.\n\nSouth Africa is one of the world's leading mining and mineral-processing\ncountries. Though mining's contribution to the national GDP has fallen from\n21% in 1970 to 6% in 2011, it still represents almost 60% of exports. The\nmining sector accounts for up to 9% of value added.\n\nIn 2008, South Africa's estimated share of world platinum production amounted\nto 77%; kyanite and other materials, 55%; chromium, 45%; palladium, 39%;\nvermiculite, 39%; vanadium, 38%; zirconium, 30%; manganese, 21%; rutile, 20%;\nilmenite, 19%; gold, 11%; fluorspar, 6%; aluminium, 2%; antimony, 2%; iron\nore, 2%; nickel, 2%; and phosphate rock, 1%.

The government has\nbeen accused of either putting in too much effort, or not enough effort, to\ntackle the problem of farm attacks as opposed to other forms of violent crime.\n\nMaize production, which contributes to a 36% majority of the gross value of\nSouth Africa's field crops, has also experienced negative effects due to\nclimate change. The estimated value of loss, which takes into consideration\nscenarios with and without the carbon dioxide fertilization effect, ranges\nbetween tens and hundreds of millions of Rands.\n\nAccording to FAOSTAT, South Africa is one of world's largest producers of:\nchicory roots (4th); grapefruit (4th); cereals (5th); green maize and maize\n(7th); castor oil seed (9th); pears (9th); sisal (10th); fibre crops (10th).\nIn the first quarter of 2010, the agricultural sector earned export revenues\nfor R10.1 billion and used R8.4 billion to pay for imported agricultural\nproducts, therefore earning a positive trade balance of R1.7 billion.\n\nThe most important agricultural exports of South Africa include: edible fruit\nand nuts, beverages, preserved food, tobacco, cereals, wool not carded or\ncombed, miscellaneous food, sugar, meat, milling products, malt and starch.\nThese products accounted for over 80% of agricultural export revenue in the\nfirst quarter of 2010. The most important agricultural imports, which\naccounted for over 60% of agricultural import value during the same period,\ninclude: cereals, meat, soya-bean oil cake, beverages, soya-bean oil and its\nfractions, tobacco, palm oil and its fractions, miscellaneous food, spices,\ncoffee, tea, and preserved food.\n\nThe dairy industry consists of around 4,300 milk producers providing\nemployment for 60,000 farm workers and contributing to the livelihoods of\naround 40,000 others.\n\nThe food sub-sector is the largest employer within the agro-processing sector\n– contributing 1.4% to total employment, and 11.5% within the manufacturing\nsector. In 2006, the agro-processing sector represented 24.7% of the total\nmanufacturing output. Although the economy as a whole gained 975,941 jobs\nbetween 1995 and 2006, the agro-processing sector lost 45,977 jobs. The\ncompetitive pressures from abroad, particularly from China and India, played a\nrole in the decline of exports for the food, textiles and paper sub-sectors,\nas firms in these sectors increasingly compete with lower cost producers.\nIncreased exports from the beverages, tobacco, wood and leather sub-sectors\nover the period are probably due to the presence of large dominant firms\nwithin these sectors in South Africa, that have managed to remain competitive."

Vehicle exports were\nin the region of 170,000 units in 2007, exported mainly to Japan (about 29% of\nthe value of total exports), Australia (20%), the UK (12%) and the US (11%).\nSouth Africa also exported ZAR 30.3 billion worth of auto components in 2006.\n\nBMW, Ford, Volkswagen, Daimler-Chrysler, General Motors, Nissan and Toyota all\nhave production plants in South Africa. Large component manufacturers with\nbases in the country are Arvin Exhaust, Bloxwitch, Corning and Senior\nFlexonics. There are also about 200 automotive component manufacturers in\nSouth Africa, and more than 150 others that supply the industry on a non-\nexclusive basis. The industry is concentrated in two provinces, the Eastern\nCape and Gauteng. Companies producing in South Africa can take advantage of\nthe low production costs and the access to new markets as a result of trade\nagreements with the European Union and the Southern African Development\nCommunity.\n\nAfter a steep decline of 10.4% in 2009, the manufacturing sector performed\nwell in 2010, growing by 5%, though this rebound was primarily limited to the\nautomotive, basic chemicals, iron and steel and food and beverages industries.\nThe performance of this sector remains curtailed by the low demand in South\nAfrica's main export markets in the developed world. There is growth in some\nareas, such as the Space industry in South Africa, which is expected to see an\nincrease in Space industry jobs, and jobs in supporting technology and\nmanufacturing sectors."

    "text": "South Africa has an extreme and persistent high unemployment rate of over 30%,\nwhich interacts with other socioeconomic problems such as: inadequate\neducation, poor health and high levels of crime. The poorest have limited\naccess to economic opportunities and basic services. According to a 2013\nGoldman Sachs report, that number increases to 35% when including people who\nhave given up looking for work. A quarter of South Africans live on less than\nUS$1.25 a day.\n\nSouth Africa's mass unemployment dates back to the 1970s, and continued to\nrise throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Unemployment has increased substantially\nsince the African National Congress came to power in 1994, increasing from\n15.6% in 1995 to 30.3% in 2001. In the second quarter of 2010, the jobless\nrate increased to 25.3%, and the number of people with work fell by 61,000 to\n12,700,000. The biggest decline in employment was recorded in the\nmanufacturing industry, which lost 53,000 jobs. Agriculture lost 32,000 jobs,\nemployment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. In the third quarter\nof 2010, 29.80% of blacks were recorded as unemployed, compared with 22.30% of\nColoureds, 8.60% of Asians and 5.10% of Whites.\n\nThe official unemployment rate, though very high by international standards,\nunderstates its magnitude because it includes only adults who are actively\nlooking for work. Therefore, excluding those who have given up looking for\nemployment. Only 41% of the population of working age have any kind of job\n(formal or informal). This rate is 30% points lower than that of China, and\nabout 25% lower than that of Brazil or Indonesia. The relatively generous\nsocial grants reduces the political cost of unemployment. There is some\nevidence that households view paid employment and social grants as substitutes\nat the margin: households that lose a pension-eligible member subsequently\nreport increased labour force participation.\n\nThe unemployment problem is characterised by its lengthy duration. In the\nmid-1990s, nearly two-thirds of unemployed people had never worked for a\nsalary. The 2005 Labour Force Survey found that 40% of unemployed individuals\nhave been unemployed for more than three years, while 59% had never had a job\nat all. The unemployment rate has fuelled crime, inequality and social unrest.\nThe global economic downturn made the problem worse, wiping out more than one\nmillion jobs. In September 2010, over one-third of South Africa's workforce\nwere out of work, and so were more than half of blacks aged 15–34, three times\nthe level than Whites.\n\nSome experts contend that higher wages negotiated by politically powerful\ntrade unions have suppressed job growth. According to a study by Dani Rodrik,\nthe shrinkage of the non-mineral tradable sector since the early-1990s and the\nweakness of the export-oriented manufacturing were more to blame for the low\nlevel of employment."

South Africa's Bureau of Statistics estimates that between 1\nmillion and 1.6 million people in skilled, professional, and managerial\noccupations have emigrated overseas between 1994 and 2004 and that, for every\nemigrant, 10 unskilled people lose their jobs. There are a range of causes\ncited for the migration of skilled South Africans.\n\nIn mid-1998, the Southern African Migration Project (SAMP) undertook a study\nto examine and assess the range of factors that contribute to skilled South\nAfricans' desire to leave the country: over two-thirds of the sample said that\nthey had given the idea of emigration some thought while 38% said they had\ngiven it a \"great deal of thought\".\n\nAmong the reasons cited for wishing to leave the country was the declining\nquality of life and high levels of crime. Furthermore, the government's\naffirmative action policy was identified as another factor influencing the\nemigration of skilled White South Africans. The results of the survey indicate\nthat skilled Whites are strongly opposed to this policy and the arguments\nadvanced in support of it, due to the negative impact it has had on South\nAfrica.\n\nHowever, flight of human capital in South Africa should not be attributed\nsolely to regional factors. For example, the demand for skilled labourers in\nthe UK, US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia has led to active recruitment\nprograms by those countries in South Africa. These countries accounted for 75%\n(by volume) of recent skilled emigration with the UK receiving approximately\nhalf of annual skilled South African emigration from 1990 to 1996. It has been\nsuggested that the role of domestic socio-political variables may be\nnegligible. The health sector has been hit particularly hard.\n\nA widespread skills drain in South Africa and in the developing world in\ngeneral is generally considered to be a cause for concern.\n\nFor the medical sector, the loss of returns from investment for all doctors\nemigrating is $1.41bn for South Africa. The benefit to destination countries\nis huge: $2.7bn for the United Kingdom alone.\n\nIn a case of reverse brain drain a net 359,000 high-skilled South Africans\nhave returned to South Africa from foreign work assignments over a five-year\nperiod from 2008 to 2013. This was catalysed by the 2008 financial crisis and\nperceptions of higher quality of life in South Africa relative to the\ncountries from which they first emigrated to. It is estimated that around 37%\nof those returning are professionals such as lawyers, doctors, engineers and\naccountants."

Since then, the African National\nCongress government created the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy,\ndesigned to increase the participation of blacks, Coloreds, and Indians in the\neconomy.\n\nHowever, BEE has faced criticism for not doing enough to accomplish this goal\nand only benefiting a small number of people to a great extent. This was\nacknowledged in 2010 by Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, at the first\nmeeting of the BEE Advisory Council, when he said, \"The story of black\neconomic empowerment in the last 15 years has been a story dominated by a few\nindividuals benefiting a lot.\" A 2010 report from the OECD concluded that the\n\"relative improvement in poverty levels,\" since the end of apartheid, has\nactually been driven by social assistance grants and not the labour market.\n\nAs of 2014, roughly ten percent of the Top 100 companies on the Johannesburg\nStock Exchange were directly held by black investors through Black Economic\nEmpowerment schemes. Black Economic Empowerment policies have been credited\nwith creating a class of Black South Africans with a level of wealth on the\nsame order of magnitude as very rich White South Africans.\n\nBlack Economic Empowerment—its purpose the \"economic empowerment of all black\npeople, including women, workers, youth, people with disabilities and people\nliving in rural areas\"—requires the Minister of Trade and Industry to develop\nand publish Codes of Good Practice, aimed at setting guidelines for the\nprocess of BEE in the whole economy. A scorecard is used by the department to\nmeasure compliance with the BEE requirements, and is used for public\nprocurement, public-private partnerships, sale of state-owned enterprises,\nwhen licenses are applied for, and for any other relevant economic activity.\n\nThe government's Black Economic Empowerment policies have drawn criticism from\nthe Development Bank of Southern Africa for focusing \"almost exclusively on\npromoting individual ownership by black people (which) does little to address\nbroader economic disparities, though the rich may become more diverse.\" The\nSystem has also been criticised for placing lesser educated people in more\nimportant positions in the workplace and their failure to perform to the\nstandards required has had an immense impact on the economy.\n\nAnother criticism also includes that the system goes against the\nconstitution's preaching of equality by having preference over people, not on\nmerit, but for their skin colour and is considered the opposite of what many\npeople fought for during the Apartheid era. Official affirmative action\npolicies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black\nmiddle class.\n\nAn increasing number of black candidates who are supposed to be beneficiaries\nof affirmative action are dissociating themselves from it, largely because of\nthe perception that the appointments are not based on merit. The policy has\nalso been criticised for having a negative impact on employment levels as it\nis viewed as being more of an additional burden for employees than as a\ntransformative agent for the unemployed. Particularity in an economy where a\nmajor cause of inequality has been a growing disparity of income within the\nmajority black population divided along lines of employment."

However, more women are becoming part of the\nagricultural workforce (55%) as of 2012, marking a move towards modernisation\nfor women's participation in the economy.\n\nSouth African legislation is strongly geared to promoting gender equality in\nthe workplace. This is characterised by several comprehensive government\nprograms and organisations that provide resources and services to females,\nboth adult and adolescent. Such initiatives include the Employment Equity Act,\nNo. 55 of 1988 (aimed at promoting women's participation in mainly private\nsector jobs). UNFPA South Africa is one such promoter of these policies and\nprograms. Internally, the South African government has founded the Commission\nfor Gender Equality. The commissions main focus is on securing adequate\neducation and job training for women who are disenfranchised or otherwise at a\ndisadvantage when attempting to enter the workforce.\n\nNot uncommon in Africa, gender equality seems to be a very cogent problem in\nthe South African workforce. According to Bain & Company, around 31% of\ncompanies have no form of female leadership, either in management or executive\npositions. 22% of board directors are women, however, only 7% were designated\nas \"executives\", lower than the global average of 12%.

The good level of\neconomic growth in the post-apartheid period has led to a measurable decline\nin income poverty, but inequality has increased.\n\nThe high level of overall income inequality has further accentuated: the\ncountry's Gini coefficient increased by four percentage points, from 0.66 to\n0.70, between 1993 and 2008, and income has become increasingly concentrated\nin the top decile. Inequality between urban and rural areas is changing: while\nrural poverty rates remain substantially higher than those in urban areas,\nurban poverty rates are rising and rural rates seem to be falling.\n\nWhile between-race inequality is slowly falling, an increase in intra-race\ninequality is preventing the aggregate measures from declining. Despite that,\nbetween-race inequality remains a central issue: real incomes have been rising\nfor all groups, but many blacks in the country still live in poverty. At any\npoverty line, blacks are very much poorer than coloureds, who are very much\npoorer than Indians, who are poorer than whites. In 2002, according to one\nestimate, 62% of Black Africans, 29% of Coloureds, 11% of Asians, and 4% of\nWhites lived in poverty.\n\nThe mean per-capita income has risen from R10,741 in 1993 to R24,409 in 2008,\nbut these figures hide large differences in household welfare, both within and\nacross population groups: the average Black income increased from R6,018 in\n1993 to R9,718 in 2008; for Coloured households, the increase was from R7,498\nto R25,269; for Whites, the increase was from R29,372 to R110,195.\n\nWhile mean income rose about 130% from 1993 to 2008, the median income rose\njust 15% over the same period, from R4,444 to R5,096, indicating that the\nincreases are being driven by a small number of very large incomes, especially\nfor Whites.\n\nIn 2000 the average white household was earning six times more than the\naverage black household. In 2004, 29.8% of all households had an income (at\nconstant 2001 prices) of less than R9,600 per annum, while 10.3% of all\nhouseholds enjoyed an annual income (at constant 2001 prices) of more than\nR153,601 per annum.\n\nOne study using calculations based on National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS)\ndata suggests that 47% of South Africans live below the poverty line: 56% of\nblacks live in poverty compared to 2% of whites, using an arbitrary income\npoverty line of R502 per capita. Although, it should also be noted that black\nSouth Africans make up the majority of the population at 79.2% while white\nSouth Africans make up only 8.9% of the population according to the Statistics\nSouth Africa census released in 2011.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index (HDI) ranked\nSouth Africa 110 out of 169 countries in 2010. The report notes, however, that\nthe region's assessment has improved slowly since 1980. The HDI includes a\nHuman Poverty Index (HPI-1), which ranked South Africa 85 out of 135\ncountries.\n\nThe number of South Africans living below the poverty line, identified\naccording to Apartheid-era social categories, was calculated in one study as\n56% \"black\", 27% \"coloured\", 9% \"Indian\", and 2% \"white\". In the past\ninequality in South Africa was largely defined along race lines, but it has\nbecome increasingly defined by inequality within population groups as the gap\nbetween rich and poor within each group has increased substantially.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposals for\naddressing income inequality included: encouraging more saving and investment;\na liberalisation of product-market regulation; easier access to credit for\nsmall businesses; greater co-ordination in wage bargaining; and measures to\ntackle the high level of youth unemployment. Some proposals have included wage\nsubsidies for people being trained, a minimum wage differentiated by age, and\nextended periods of probation for young workers. In post-Apartheid South\nAfrica, only Asians have made significant strides in closing the income gap\nwith Whites; while Coloured and Black South Africans have had much more muted\nprogress.\n\nA 2011 study published by the University of Cape Town about the richest 10%\nfound that nearly 40% are black, where this group had once been almost\nexclusively white. While only 29% of the absolute wealthiest[_vague_] South\nAfricans are black, this jumps to 50% among the \"entry-level\" rich (defined as\nearning more than $4,000 per month). Factors that were found to be common\namong those in the entry-level rich group include being young, entrepreneurial\nand having some post-secondary education.\n\nAccording to one estimate, 10.4% of South Africans belonged to the \"higher\nmiddle class\" in 2004, defined as having a per capita income of over R40,000\n(in 2000 Rand)."

At present,\nblacks contribute some 50% of total government transfers, while receiving\nroughly 80%.\n\nThe Unemployment Insurance Fund is financed out of premiums, contributions and\nbenefits depend on earnings, and focuses on insuring workers against the risk\nof income loss."

They are provided in the form\nof: grants for older persons; disability grants; war veterans grants; care\ndependency grants; foster child grants; child support grants; grant-in-aid;\nsocial relief of distress.\n\nThe state old age pension, received by over 80% of the elderly, is a non-\ncontributory pension and pays more than twice median per capita Black income,\nthus representing an important source of income for a third of all Black\nhouseholds in the country. It pays a maximum of R1,780 (as of July 2019) to\npeople who reach pension age without access to private pensions.\n\nThe child support grant provides R420 per month, per child (as of July 2019)\nfor every child in the household younger than 18, and benefited 9.1 million\nchildren by April 2009.\n\nThe war veterans grant is provided to former soldiers who fought in the Second\nWorld War or the Korean War, and pays a maximum amount of R1,800 per month (as\nof July 2019)."

    "text": "According to a December 2010 article by the South African Government\nCommunication and Information System's now-defunct BuaNews news service, South\nAfrica was said to compare well to other emerging markets on affordability and\navailability of capital, financial market sophistication, business tax rates\nand infrastructure, but to fare poorly on the cost and availability of labour,\neducation, and the use of technology and innovation. South Africa does have\nexpertise in the Space industry, and students learning more through the South\nAfrican SEDS. With the correct government support, South Africa can increase\nthe jobs in the manufacturing, testing, and analysis sectors of the growing\nSpace industry.\n\nReleased in early December 2010 and no longer available online, the survey by\nBrazil's National Confederation of Industry, \"Competitividade Brasil 2010:\nComparaçao com Paises Selecionados\", (Competition Brazil: A comparison with\nselected countries), found South Africa to have the second most sophisticated\nfinancial market and the second-lowest effective business tax rate (business\ntaxes as a percentage of company profits), out of 14 surveyed countries.\n\nThe country was also ranked fourth for ease of accessing capital, fourth for\ncost of capital, sixth for its transport infrastructure (at the time\nconsidered better than that of China, India, Mexico, Brazil and Poland, but\nbehind that of Korea and Chile), and seventh for foreign direct investment as\na percentage of GDP: in 2008 it was over 3% of the GDP.\n\nNevertheless, South Africa is falling behind other emerging markets, such as\nIndia and China, owing to several factors: the country is relatively small,\nwithout the advantage of a huge domestic customer base; it has had for decades\nan unusually low rate of saving and investment, partly because of low\ndisposable income; an inadequate education system results in an acute shortage\nof skilled manpower; a strong and volatile currency deters investors and makes\nits exports less competitive; the infrastructure, though far better than in\nthe rest of Africa, suffers from severe bottlenecks, including scheduled power\nshortages, and urgently needs upgrading.\n\nIn 2011, after a year of observer status, South Africa officially joined the\nBRICS group of now-five emerging-market nations at the summit held in Sanya,\nHainan, China."
