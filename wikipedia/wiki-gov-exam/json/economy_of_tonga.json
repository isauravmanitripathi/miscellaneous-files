Much of the\nmonetary sector of the economy is dominated, if not owned, by the royal family\nand nobles. This is particularly true of the telecommunications and satellite\nservices. Much of small business, particularly retailing on Tongatapu, is now\ndominated by recent Chinese immigrants who arrived under a cash-for-passports\nscheme that ended in 1998.\n\nThe manufacturing sector consists of handicrafts and a few other very\nsmallscale industries, all of which contribute only about 3% of GDP.\nCommercial business activities also are inconspicuous and, to a large extent,\nare dominated by the same large trading companies found throughout the South\nPacific. In September 1974, the country's first commercial trading bank, the\nBank of Tonga, opened.\n\nRural Tongans rely on plantation and subsistence agriculture. Coconuts,\nvanilla beans, and bananas are the major cash crops. The processing of\ncoconuts into copra and desiccated coconut is the only significant industry.\nPigs and poultry are the major types of livestock. Horses are kept for draft\npurposes, primarily by farmers working their api. More cattle are being\nraised, and beef imports are declining.\n\nTonga's development plans emphasize a growing private sector, upgrading\nagricultural productivity, revitalizing the squash and vanilla bean\nindustries, developing tourism, and improving the island's communications and\ntransportation systems. A small but growing construction sector is developing\nin response to the inflow of aid monies and remittances from Tongans abroad.\nThe copra industry is plagued by world prices that have been depressed for\nyears.\n\nEfforts are being made to discover ways to diversify. One hope is seen in\nfisheries; tests have shown that sufficient skipjack tuna pass through Tongan\nwaters to support a fishing industry. Another potential development activity\nis exploitation of forests, which cover 35% of the kingdom's land area but are\ndecreasing as land is cleared. Coconut trees past their prime bearing years\nalso provide a potential source of lumber.\n\nThe tourist industry is relatively undeveloped; however, the government\nrecognizes that tourism can play a major role in economic development, and\nefforts are being made to increase this source of revenue. Cruise ships often\nstop in Nukuʻalofa and Vava'u.\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook,\n\n> The Tongan economy's base is agriculture, which contributes 30% to GDP.\n> Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are the main crops, and\n> agricultural exports make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must\n> import a high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The\n> industrial sector accounts for only 10% of GDP. Tourism is the primary\n> source of hard currency earnings.
