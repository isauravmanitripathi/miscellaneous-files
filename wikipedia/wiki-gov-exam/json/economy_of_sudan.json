    "text": "Current GDP per capita of Sudan grew 46% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth\nof 170% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently\nscaled back to 34% in the 1980s. Finally, it shrank by 26% in the 1990s.\n\nUntil the early 1970s Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to\ninternal consumption. In 1972 the Sudanese government became more pro-Western,\nand made plans to export food and cash crops. However, commodity prices\ndeclined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same\ntime, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture,\nrose. In 1978 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) negotiated a Structural\nAdjustment Program with the government. This further promoted the mechanized\nexport agriculture sector. This caused great economic problems for the\npastoralists of Sudan.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and to 1980s, the IMF, World Bank, and key donors worked\nclosely to promote reforms to counter the effect of inefficient economic\npolicies and practices. By 1984, a combination of factors, including drought,\ninflation, and confused application of Islamic law, reduced donor\ndisbursements and capital flight led to a serious foreign-exchange crisis and\nincreased shortages of imported inputs and commodities. More significantly,\nthe 1989 revolution caused many donors in Europe, the U.S., and Canada to\nsuspend official development assistance, but not humanitarian aid.\n\nHowever, as Sudan became the world's largest debtor to the World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund by 1993, its relationship with the international\nfinancial institutions soured in the mid-1990s and has yet to be fully\nrehabilitated. The government fell out of compliance with an IMF standby\nprogram and accumulated substantial arrearages on repurchase obligations. A\n4-year economic reform plan was announced in 1988 but was not pursued.\n\nAn economic reform plan was announced in 1989 and began implementing a 3-year\neconomic restructuring program designed to reduce the public sector deficit,\nend subsidies, privatize state enterprises, and encourage new foreign and\ndomestic investment. In 1993, the IMF suspended Sudan's voting rights and the\nWorld Bank suspended Sudan's right to make withdrawals under effective and\nfully disbursed loans and credits. Lome Funds and EU agricultural credits,\ntotaling more than one billion euros, also were suspended.",

In the 1955–56 census, almost 86 percent of those then considered as\npart of the workforce were involved in agriculture, livestock raising,\nforestry, fisheries, or hunting. The ILO estimated that by 1998, the figure\nhad declined to 70–80 percent. By 2008 the government claimed that the\npercentage was significantly lower. The services sector, which included a\ngovernment workforce that grew about 10 percent a year in the 1970s, emerged\nas the second largest area of activity, encompassing an estimated 13–22\npercent of those economically active in 1998, compared with 4.6 percent in\n1955–56. The industry sector, including manufacturing, mining, electric power,\nand construction, accounted for 7–9 percent during 1998, compared to 5.6\npercent in 1955–56. The proportions of the labor force in each of these\nsectors undoubtedly changed after the estimates were made in 1998, as the\nrelative importance of these sectors altered in the succeeding years. It was\ndifficult to determine the extent of the changes, however, as despite the oil\nsector's great importance, it did not directly employ many people. Its impact\non employment occurred as a result of the increased spending allowed to the\ngovernment, which created new jobs, often in the public sector.",
