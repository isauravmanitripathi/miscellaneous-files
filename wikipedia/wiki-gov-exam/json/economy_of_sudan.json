GDP growth registered\nmore than 10% per year in 2006 and 2007. Sudan had $30.873 billion by gross\ndomestic product as of 2019, and has been working with the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) to implement macroeconomic reforms, including a managed\nfloat of the exchange rate. Sudan began exporting crude oil in the last\nquarter of 1999.\n\nAgricultural production remains important, because it employs 80% of the work\nforce and contributes a third of the GDP. The War in Darfur, the aftermath of\ntwo decades of war in the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2005) in the south,\nthe lack of basic infrastructure in large areas, and a reliance by much of the\npopulation on subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will\nremain at or below the poverty line for years. The problem remains, despite\nrapid rises in average per capita income. In January 2007, the government\nintroduced a new Sudanese pound, at an initial exchange rate of US$1 = £S.2\\.\nSudan is still a least developed country according to United Nations."

    "text": "Current GDP per capita of Sudan grew 46% in the 1960s, reaching a peak growth\nof 170% in the 1970s. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently\nscaled back to 34% in the 1980s. Finally, it shrank by 26% in the 1990s.\n\nUntil the early 1970s Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to\ninternal consumption. In 1972 the Sudanese government became more pro-Western,\nand made plans to export food and cash crops. However, commodity prices\ndeclined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same\ntime, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture,\nrose. In 1978 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) negotiated a Structural\nAdjustment Program with the government. This further promoted the mechanized\nexport agriculture sector. This caused great economic problems for the\npastoralists of Sudan.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and to 1980s, the IMF, World Bank, and key donors worked\nclosely to promote reforms to counter the effect of inefficient economic\npolicies and practices. By 1984, a combination of factors, including drought,\ninflation, and confused application of Islamic law, reduced donor\ndisbursements and capital flight led to a serious foreign-exchange crisis and\nincreased shortages of imported inputs and commodities. More significantly,\nthe 1989 revolution caused many donors in Europe, the U.S., and Canada to\nsuspend official development assistance, but not humanitarian aid.\n\nHowever, as Sudan became the world's largest debtor to the World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund by 1993, its relationship with the international\nfinancial institutions soured in the mid-1990s and has yet to be fully\nrehabilitated. The government fell out of compliance with an IMF standby\nprogram and accumulated substantial arrearages on repurchase obligations. A\n4-year economic reform plan was announced in 1988 but was not pursued.\n\nAn economic reform plan was announced in 1989 and began implementing a 3-year\neconomic restructuring program designed to reduce the public sector deficit,\nend subsidies, privatize state enterprises, and encourage new foreign and\ndomestic investment. In 1993, the IMF suspended Sudan's voting rights and the\nWorld Bank suspended Sudan's right to make withdrawals under effective and\nfully disbursed loans and credits. Lome Funds and EU agricultural credits,\ntotaling more than one billion euros, also were suspended."

    "text": "A Sudanese farmer\n\nPrimary resources are agricultural, including cotton, peanuts, gum arabic, and\nsesame seeds. Although the country is trying to diversify its cash crops,\ncotton and peanuts remain its major agricultural exports. Grain sorghum (dura)\nis the principal food crop, and wheat is grown for domestic consumption.\nSesame seeds and peanuts are cultivated for domestic consumption and\nincreasingly for export.\n\nThree main agricultural sub-sectors are active in Sudan: pastoral livestock,\ncropping and fish production. Livestock production has vast potential, and\nmany animals, particularly cows, sheep, and camels, are exported to Saudi\nArabia and other Arab countries. However, Sudan remains a net importer of\nfood. Problems of investment finance, production and transportation remain the\ngreatest constraints to a more dynamic agricultural economy. A major problem\nwhich has been growing for decades is the continual loss of open lands\npreviously used for animal grazing to mechanized drylands and irrigated\nfarming.\n\nSudan has 84 million hectares of arable land and less than 20% is cultivated.\nMajor agricultural projects such as the Gezera Scheme in Gezira state are\nunderway in order to make Sudan food self-sufficient. Sudan is one of the\nworld's potential breadbaskets and Sudan is nicknamed as the Arab world food\nbasket as it accounts for 45% of arable land in the Arab world. In 1998 there\nwas an estimated 16.9 million ha (42 million acres) of arable land and\napproximately 1.9 million ha (4.7 million acres) set aside for irrigation,\nprimarily in the north of the country along the banks of the Nile and other\nrivers.\n\nCash crops (as of 1999) grown under irrigation in these areas include cotton\nand cottonseed, which is of primary importance to the economy with 172,000\ntons and 131,000 tons produced annually respectively, sesame (220,000 tons),\nsugarcane (5,950,000 tons), peanuts (980,000 tons), dates (176,000 tons),\ncitrus fruits, yams (136,000 tons), tomatoes (240,000 tons), mangoes, coffee,\nand tobacco. The main subsistence crops produced in Sudan are sorghum\n(3,045,000 tons), millet (1,499,000 tons), wheat (168,000 tons), cowpeas,\nbeans, pulses, corn (65,000), and barley. Cotton is the principal export crop\nand an integral part of the country's economy and Sudan is the world's third\nlargest producer of sesame after India and China."

Due to the many countries depending on Sudan\nfor medicines and medical services, Sudan is now concentrating on becoming a\nhub for the medical industry in East Africa, providing facilities and\nconcessions for medical investments and succeeding in covering about 70% of\nneeds and exporting to many neighboring nations. In recent years, the Giad\nIndustrial Complex in Al Jazirah state introduced the assembly of small autos\nand trucks, and some heavy military equipment such as armored personnel\ncarriers and the “Bashir” and \"Zubair\" main battle tanks as well as handguns,\nlight and heavy machine guns and howitzers and, recently, drone production.\nSudan is reputed to have great mineral resources, and exploration has started\nextensively for gold, of which is produced nearly 30 tons annually providing a\ngreat boost to the foreign exchange reserves of the nation, with the\nparticipation of many investment companies from all over the world. Quantities\nof asbestos, chromium, mica, kaolin and copper are now exploited commercially,\nespecially for export to China."

    "text": "Extensive petroleum exploration first began in Sudan in the mid-1970s.\nSignificant finds were made in the Upper Nile region and commercial quantities\nof oil began to be exported in October 2000, reducing Sudan's outflow of\nforeign exchange for imported petroleum products. Today, oil is an important\nexport industry in Sudan. Estimates suggest that oil accounts for between 70%\nand 90% of Sudan's total exports. The primary importers of Sudanese oil are\nJapan, China, South Korea, Indonesia, and India.\n\nMost of Sudan's oil reserves are located in the Muglad and Melut rift basins\nin the south of the country. Oil fields in the south, such as those at Heglig\nand in the South Sudanese state of Unity, formerly part of Sudanese territory,\nare linked to the country's refineries via pipelines. The two largest oil\npipelines are the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline, which travels 1,600 kilometres\nfrom the Unity oil field to Port Sudan on the Red Sea via Khartoum, and the\nPetroDar pipeline, which extends 1,380 kilometres from the Palogue oil field\nin the Melut Basin to Port Sudan.\n\nCrude oil from the Muglad Basin is known as \"Nile Blend\" and is refined at the\nKhartoum crude oil refinery. In 2006, the China National Petroleum Corporation\nupgraded the Khartoum refinery, doubling its capacity to 100,000 barrels per\nday (16,000 m3/d). Oil from the Melud Basin is known as \"Dar Blend\" and is\nrefined at the Port Sudan Refinery, which has a capacity of 21,700 barrels per\nday (3,450 m3/d). In 2005, the Sudanese government contracted Petronas to\nbuild a new refinery at Port Sudan."

In rural areas, large numbers of women\nand girls engage in traditional productive occupations, but many probably are\nnot included in calculations of the active workforce.\n\nMore than 7.9 million people were employed in Sudan in 1989, according to an\nInternational Labour Organisation (ILO) estimate. In the early 1990s, the\nemployment scene was exacerbated by the 1991 Persian Gulf War, which resulted\nin the return home of thousands of Sudanese workers who had been based in\nKuwait and Iraq, leaving many of their possessions behind. Sudan's support of\nIraq was also a factor in the departure of thousands of Sudanese workers from\nSaudi Arabia. By 2000, the total labor force of Sudan had grown to an\nestimated 12 million, of which the government counted 9.6 million as actively\nemployed. Approximately 30 percent of the workforce was female."

In 1983–84, for example, several million people\nmigrated from the worst-hit areas in both Western and Eastern Sudan to\nKhartoum and other urban areas along the Nile. Many remained in these areas\nonce the drought had eased, living in shantytowns and contributing to\nunemployment, underemployment, or employment in the informal sector in the\ncities. In addition, more than 2 million people from the South migrated to the\nNorth over the years, as a result of the civil war and famines in these areas.\nIn 2009 the government estimated unemployment at about 20 percent, perhaps not\nan accurate figure, because a large proportion of Sudanese engaged in small-\nscale and subsistence agriculture."

    "text": "Agriculture was formerly the predominant activity in Sudan, although its share\nof the labor force gradually declined as other sectors of economic activity\nexpanded. In the 1955–56 census, almost 86 percent of those then considered as\npart of the workforce were involved in agriculture, livestock raising,\nforestry, fisheries, or hunting. The ILO estimated that by 1998, the figure\nhad declined to 70–80 percent. By 2008 the government claimed that the\npercentage was significantly lower. The services sector, which included a\ngovernment workforce that grew about 10 percent a year in the 1970s, emerged\nas the second largest area of activity, encompassing an estimated 13–22\npercent of those economically active in 1998, compared with 4.6 percent in\n1955–56. The industry sector, including manufacturing, mining, electric power,\nand construction, accounted for 7–9 percent during 1998, compared to 5.6\npercent in 1955–56. The proportions of the labor force in each of these\nsectors undoubtedly changed after the estimates were made in 1998, as the\nrelative importance of these sectors altered in the succeeding years. It was\ndifficult to determine the extent of the changes, however, as despite the oil\nsector's great importance, it did not directly employ many people. Its impact\non employment occurred as a result of the increased spending allowed to the\ngovernment, which created new jobs, often in the public sector."

For example, children as young as 11 or 12\nyears of age worked in a number of factories outside the capital that produced\nedible oils. Child labor was widespread in the informal economy, and children\ntraditionally worked on the family farm from a young age. Sudan did not adhere\nto ILO Convention no. 182, the Worst Forms of Child Labor. The Child Act of\n2010, among other laws, governed hours and working conditions of young people,\nbut the law was not effectively enforced, particularly in the informal sector,\nwhere enforcement was especially difficult."

Nevertheless, there were\ncredible reports that slavery persisted, particularly affecting women and\nchildren, and that the seizure and sale of women as domestic servants\ncontinued. All sides in the Sudanese conflict also conscripted men and boys\nforcibly into their fighting forces. In May 1998, the government formed the\nCommittee for the Eradication of the Abduction of Women and Children, which\nresulted in the identification and release of several hundred abductees, but\nthe government did not police the laws on forced and bonded labor effectively.\nIn November 2001, the government announced the establishment of special\ncivilian tribunals in the border regions separating the South and the North of\nthe country to prosecute persons involved in the abduction, transport,\nholding, and selling or exchanging of women and children from war zones. Even\nso, as late as 2010, the Committee surmised that possibly 10,000 or more\nabductees from groups such as the Misiriyyah and Rizayqat as well as South\nSudanese were engaged in some form of forced labor in the border regions."

A consequence of the embargo is that U.S.\ncorporations cannot invest in the Sudan oil industry, so companies in China,\nMalaysia and India are the major investors.\n\nHistorically, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy,\nGermany, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) nations traditionally have supplied most of Sudan's economic\nassistance.
