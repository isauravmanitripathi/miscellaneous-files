    "text": "The **economy of Andorra** is a developed and free market economy driven by\nfinance, retail, and tourism. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) was\nUS$6.00 billion in 2024. Attractive for shoppers from France and Spain as a\nfree port, Andorra also has developed active summer and winter tourist\nresorts. With some 270 hotels and 400 restaurants, as well as many shops, the\ntourist trade employs a growing portion of the domestic labour force. An\nestimated 10 million tourists visit annually.\n\nThere is a fairly active trade in consumer goods, including imported\nmanufactured items, which, because they are duty-free, are less expensive in\nAndorra than in neighboring countries. Andorra's duty-free status also has had\na significant effect on the controversy concerning its relationship with the\nEuropean Union (EU). Its negotiations on duty-free status and relationship\nwith the EU began in 1987, soon after Spain joined. An agreement that went\ninto effect in July 1991 sets duty-free quotas and places limits on certain\nitems â€“ mainly milk products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.\nAndorra is permitted to maintain price differences from other EU countries,\nand visitors enjoy limited duty-free allowances.\n\nThe results of Andorra's elections thus far indicate that many support the\ngovernment's reform initiatives and believe the country must, to some degree,\nintegrate into the European Union in order to continue to enjoy its\nprosperity. Although arable land comprises less than 2% of the country,\nagriculture was the mainstay of the Andorran economy until the upsurge in\ntourism. Sheep raising has been the principal agricultural activity, but\ntobacco growing is lucrative. Most of Andorra's food is imported.\n\nIn addition to handicrafts, manufacturing includes cigars, cigarettes and\nfurniture for domestic and export markets. A hydroelectric plant at Les\nEscaldes, with a capacity of 26.5 megawatts, provides 40% of Andorra's\nelectricity; Spain provides the rest."

    "text": "Tourism is the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounting for roughly 80% of\nGDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's\nduty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative\nadvantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain\nhave been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower\ntariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes\nsubstantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity\nof arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock\nactivity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars\nand furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as\nan EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)."
