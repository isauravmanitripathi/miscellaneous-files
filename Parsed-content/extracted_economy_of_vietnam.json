        "• A 2019 study found that Vietnam's WTO accession resulted in substantial productivity gains for private firms but had no impact on state-owned enterprises; without state-owned enterprises, overall productivity gains would have been approximately 40% larger."

        "• Vietnam’s GDP growth declined to 6% in 1998 and further to 5% in 1999, but from 2000 onwards, the country experienced continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% annually.",
        "• On July 13, 2000, Vietnam and the United States signed the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), granting Vietnamese goods \"normal trade relations\" status in the U.S. market, which was expected to accelerate Vietnam’s transition to a manufacturing-based, export-oriented economy and attract foreign investment from the U.S., Europe, Asia, and other regions.",
        "• In 2001, the Communist Party of Vietnam approved a 10-year economic plan that increased the role of the private sector while reaffirming state primacy; between 2000 and 2002, GDP growth rose to 6%-7% despite a global recession, making Vietnam the world’s second fastest-growing economy.",
        "• During the same period (2000-2002), investment in Vietnam tripled and domestic savings increased fivefold, reflecting strong economic momentum.",
        "• By 2003, the private sector contributed to more than 25% of all industrial output; however, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam’s ranking in the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness report declined sharply due to negative perceptions of government institutional effectiveness.",
        "• Endemic official corruption, weak property rights, inefficient market regulations, and slow reforms in labor and financial markets were identified as major challenges hindering Vietnam’s competitiveness.",

        "• WTO accession was expected to boost Vietnam’s economy by ensuring continued liberalizing reforms and expanding trade opportunities, but also posed challenges by exposing the economy to increased foreign competition.",
        "• Despite rapid growth exceeding 7% annually, Vietnam’s economy started from a very low base due to the long-term impacts of the Vietnam War (1950s-1970s), U.S. and allied embargoes, and post-war austerity measures.",
        "• In 2012, the Communist Party publicly apologized for economic mismanagement following widespread bankruptcies of SOEs and rising inflation; bad debts in banks reached 15%, and GDP growth was forecasted at 5.2%, partly due to the global economic crisis.",
        "• The government initiated economic reforms including raising the foreign ownership cap from 49% and partially privatizing SOEs, aiming to address economic downturns; by the end of 2013, plans were to privatize 25%-50% of SOEs, retaining state control only over public services and the military.",
        "• These reforms stimulated a significant boom in the Vietnamese stock market, reflecting renewed investor confidence in the economy.",
        "• Vietnam’s economic difficulties sparked debates about a potential new phase in its political economy, but poverty remained a primary concern as of 2018; the Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) reported that 28% of respondents identified poverty as their main problem.",

        "• PAPI data showed bribery in public district hospital services decreased from 17% in 2016 to 9% in 2017, while reports of land seizures declined from about 9% before 2013 to less than 7% in 2017.",
        "• The percentage of respondents who believed their land was sold at fair market value dropped from 26% in 2014 to 21% in 2017; land-use graft and petty corruption, such as police bribery, remained common.",
        "• According to journalist Ralph Jennings, Vietnam has been privatizing many state-owned operations to reduce corruption and improve efficiency.",
        "• By March 2018, Vietnam’s economy continued robust growth, achieving its best annual growth rate in over a decade, prompting media speculation about its potential emergence as one of the \"Asian Tigers.\"",
        "• DBS Bank projected in 2019 that Vietnam’s economy could grow at 6.0%-6.5% annually by 2029, with potential to surpass Singapore’s economy within the next decade due to strong foreign investment inflows and productivity growth; Vietnam reportedly surpassed Singapore’s economy just one year later.",
