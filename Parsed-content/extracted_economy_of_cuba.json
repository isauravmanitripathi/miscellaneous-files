        "• Following the deterioration of economic conditions, Cuba’s economy began to show signs of improvement after 1998, driven by a rapid improvement in trade and diplomatic relations with Venezuela.",
        "• The improvement was largely due to Venezuela, especially after the election of Hugo Chávez in 1998, who became Cuba’s most important trading partner and diplomatic ally.",
