        "• Livestock exports, though difficult to quantify due to informal cross-border movements especially into Nigeria, are considered the second-largest source of export revenue after mining and oil; some hides and skins are exported and also used in handicraft production.",
        "• The agricultural and livestock sectors support the majority of Niger’s population, with only 18% not dependent on these sectors; livestock production (camels, goats, sheep, and cattle) generates 14% of GDP and supports 29% of the population, while 53% of the population is engaged in crop production.",
        "• Approximately 15% of Niger’s land is arable, predominantly located along the southern border with Nigeria.",
        "• Drought has severely degraded farmland, exemplified by the 2005 famine when farmers examined drought-stricken soil.",
        "• Principal rain-fed subsistence crops in the arable southern areas include pearl millet, sorghum, and cassava; irrigated rice is cultivated in parts of the Niger River valley in the west for internal consumption.",
        "• Since the devaluation of the CFA franc, locally produced irrigated rice has become cheaper than imported rice, encouraging increased domestic production.",
        "• Commercially grown crops for export include cowpeas and onions, with smaller quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat also cultivated for export.",
        "• Oasis farming in northern Niger produces onions, dates, and some market vegetables for export.",
        "• Rural crop farmers are mainly concentrated in the south centre and south west of Niger, within the Sahel region receiving between 300 and 600 mm (12 to 24 inches) of annual rainfall; the southern tip near Gaya receives 700 to 900 mm (28 to 35 inches) of rainfall.",
        "• Northern crop-supporting areas such as the southern Aïr Massif and Kaouar oasis depend on oases and increased rainfall due to mountain effects.",
        "• Large parts of northwest and far east Niger, located within the Sahara Desert, receive minimal seasonal rainfall sufficient only for semi-nomadic animal husbandry.",
        "• Populations in these arid regions, mainly Tuareg, Wodaabe-Fula, and Toubou ethnic groups, practice transhumance—seasonal migration southward to pasture and sell animals during the dry season, and northward into the Sahara during the brief rainy season.",
        "• Niger’s food security is highly vulnerable to rainfall variability; insufficient rains necessitate grain imports and food aid to meet population needs.",
        "• The Sahel region, including Niger, has experienced marked annual rainfall variability throughout the 20th century, with the most severe drought beginning in the late 1960s and persisting intermittently into the 1980s.",
        "• The prolonged drought severely impacted pastoralist communities, causing repeated loss of entire herds of cattle, sheep, and camels, with lingering effects into the 21st century.",
        "• Rainfall remains variable in recent years, exemplified by poor rains in 2000 and plentiful, well-distributed rains in 2001.",
        "• Soil degradation affects approximately 50% of Niger’s land, often due to intensive cereal cultivation; laterite soils, which have high clay content and thus higher cation exchange and water-holding capacities, can develop a hard crust when degraded, impeding water infiltration and seedling emergence.",
        "• Soil rehabilitation is possible through Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands, a system involving indigenous water-harvesting techniques (e.g., planting pits and trenches), application of animal and plant residues, and cultivation of drought-tolerant high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetables.",
        "• The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has implemented this bioreclamation system in Niger, successfully rehabilitating degraded laterite soils and increasing smallholder farmers’ incomes.",
        "• Trials demonstrate that a 200 m² (2,153 sq ft) plot using bioreclamation can yield approximately US$100 in income, comparable to the income men traditionally earn from millet production per hectare (10,000 m²).",
        "• Since women are often allocated degraded soils, the bioreclamation practice has notably improved livelihoods for women in Niger.",
        "• Construction of the Kandadji Dam on the Niger River began in August 2008; the dam is projected to enhance agricultural productivity in the Tillaberi Department by initially irrigating 6,000 hectares and expanding to 45,000 hectares by 2034."

        "• By 2007, many mining licenses were sold to companies from India, China, Canada, and Australia to exploit new mineral deposits in Niger.",
        "• In 2013, the Nigerien government sought to increase uranium revenues by applying the 2006 Mining Law to the two uranium mining companies, aiming to balance what it considered an unfavorable partnership with Areva (now Orano).",
        "• Areva resisted the application of the 2006 Mining Law, citing concerns about the financial health of the companies due to declining uranium prices and unfavorable market conditions.",
