        "• The economy of Mozambique had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $14.396 billion as of 2018, reflecting development since the end of the Mozambican Civil War, which lasted from 1977 to 1992.",
        "• In 1987, the Mozambican government initiated a series of macroeconomic reforms aimed at stabilizing the economy, which, together with donor assistance and political stability following the multi-party elections in 1994, resulted in significant improvements in the country's economic growth rate.",
        "• Inflation in Mozambique was low during the late 1990s but experienced an increase between 2000 and 2002.",
        "• Fiscal reforms implemented during this period included the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) and reforms to the customs service, both of which enhanced the government’s capacity to collect revenue.",
        "• Despite these economic gains, Mozambique remains heavily dependent on foreign assistance to finance much of its annual government budget.",
        "• Subsistence agriculture continues to be the primary source of employment for the majority of Mozambique’s workforce.",
        "• The country faces a substantial trade imbalance, although this gap has begun to narrow with the opening of the Mozal aluminium smelter, which is Mozambique’s largest foreign investment project to date and has increased export earnings.",
        "• Additional investment projects in sectors such as titanium extraction and processing, as well as garment manufacturing, are expected to further reduce the import/export deficit.",
        "• Mozambique’s previously significant foreign debt has been reduced to a manageable level through debt forgiveness and rescheduling under the International Monetary Fund’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives.",

        "• Since 1960, Mozambique's real GDP per capita has experienced significant fluctuations influenced by colonial rule, independence, civil war, and economic reforms.",
        "• During the colonial period under Portuguese rule, Mozambique's economy was primarily agrarian with limited industrial development, resulting in relatively low GDP per capita growth.",
        "• Following independence in 1975, Mozambique faced economic disruption due to the departure of Portuguese settlers and the nationalization of key industries, which initially caused a decline in real GDP per capita.",
        "• The onset of the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992) severely damaged infrastructure and agricultural production, leading to a prolonged period of economic contraction and stagnation in real GDP per capita.",
        "• Post-civil war reconstruction efforts beginning in the early 1990s, supported by international aid and structural adjustment programs from organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, contributed to gradual economic recovery and growth in real GDP per capita.",
        "• Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Mozambique implemented market-oriented reforms, including privatization and liberalization policies, which facilitated increased foreign investment and diversification of the economy, further improving real GDP per capita.",
        "• Despite these improvements, real GDP per capita remained relatively low compared to global averages, reflecting ongoing challenges such as poverty, limited industrialization, and vulnerability to external shocks.",
        "• By the early 21st century, Mozambique's real GDP per capita showed a steady upward trend, driven by growth in sectors such as agriculture, mining, and natural gas exploration, although disparities in income distribution persisted.",
        "• The historical trajectory of Mozambique’s real GDP per capita underscores the impact of political instability, conflict, and economic policy shifts on the country’s economic development over the past six decades."

        "• At independence in 1975, Mozambique had a well-developed industrial base by Sub-Saharan African standards due to investment booms in the 1960s and early 1970s; in 1973, its manufacturing value-added ranked sixth highest in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
        "• The rapid departure of 90% of the ethnic Portuguese population during and after independence on 25 June 1975 halted further industrialization and left the economy in disarray.",
        "• The subsequent Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992) further devastated the country’s remaining wealth and infrastructure, leaving Mozambique in a state of severe economic disrepair."

        "• The eruption of the Mozambican Civil War in 1977 pitted FRELIMO against the rebel group RENAMO, a counterinsurgency movement funded and directed by apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, turning Mozambique into a \"Cold War battlefield\" with Soviet-backed socialist FRELIMO opposing capitalist-supported RENAMO.",

        "• In 1986, under severe political and economic pressure, FRELIMO negotiated its first structural adjustment package (SAP) with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), initiating a series of SAPs that mandated privatization of major industries, reduced government spending, deregulation, and trade liberalization to establish a free market economy.",
