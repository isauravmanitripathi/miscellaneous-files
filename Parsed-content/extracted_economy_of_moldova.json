        "• The resumption of wine exports to Russia in October 2007 was a significant positive development, although export volumes were expected to recover slowly.",
        "• Fiscal policy in 2007 was tight, ending the year with a modest budget deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP, supported by strong revenue performance primarily from robust VAT collections on imports.",

        "• Monetary policy tightening in 2007 was complicated by strong foreign exchange inflows; the National Bank of Moldova increased reserve requirements from 10 to 15 percent and raised policy interest rates by 2.5 percentage points.",
        "• Despite these measures, risks to inflation remained due to potential second-round effects from the drought, liquidity pressures from growing remittances and FDI, and continued strong growth in credit and broad money supply.",
        "• Moldova remains the poorest country in Europe and has been resistant to implementing reforms that have benefited other Eastern European countries.",
        "• The Communist Party maintained political control following the March 2005 parliamentary elections and re-elected Vladimir Voronin as president through collaboration with the opposition.",
        "• Although the government professed a pro-Western stance, it struggled to pursue structural reforms and made limited progress on the International Monetary Fund’s program aimed at attracting external financial resources.",
        "• In December 2004, the parliament approved the government’s economic growth and strategy paper, but international financial institutions and Western investors remained unsatisfied until the government addressed fiscal adjustment, wage restraint, and payment of debt arrears.",
        "• Despite a slowdown in privatization and industrial output, GDP growth was 7.3 percent in 2004, consumption continued to increase, and the national currency appreciated.",
        "• The unresolved political and economic impasse in the pro-Russian Transnistria enclave persisted, characterized by corruption and smuggling of arms and contraband, despite international mediation efforts."
