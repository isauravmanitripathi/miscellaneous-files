        "• Starting in 1996, humanitarian aid focus shifted from emergency relief to reconstruction and development assistance.",
        "• Major donors and aid organizations involved in Rwanda’s post-genocide recovery included the United States, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, the People’s Republic of China, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the European Development Fund.",

        "• The government’s economic strategy focused on developing manufacturing and service industries and removing barriers to trade and development.",
        "• Rwanda’s government reported a 13% GDP growth rate in 1996, driven by improved tax revenue collection, accelerated privatization of state enterprises to reduce government resource drains, and enhanced production of export crops and food.",
        "• Rehabilitation efforts continued in tea plantations and factories, while coffee—traditionally a smallholder crop—was receiving increased attention as farmers regained a sense of security.",
        "• Coffee production in 2000 was 14,578,560 tonnes, compared to pre-civil war annual variations between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes, indicating significant recovery though still below pre-war levels.",

        "• Rwanda’s natural resources are limited, with a small mineral industry contributing about 5% of foreign exchange earnings; key minerals include cassiterite (a primary tin source) and coltan (used in electronic capacitors for consumer electronics such as cell phones, DVD players, video game systems, and computers).",

        "• The increase in coltan production was partly due to new mines opening in Rwanda but was also attributed to fraudulent re-export of coltan originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).",
        "• The Rwandan Defence Force (RDF) was reportedly involved in the coltan trade, and international dealers’ reluctance to purchase coltan directly from the DRC incentivized re-exporting DRC coltan as Rwandan.",
        "• Rwanda was also alleged to be involved in the fraudulent trade of gold and diamonds exported from the DRC."
