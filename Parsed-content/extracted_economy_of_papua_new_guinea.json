        "• Papua New Guinea (PNG) is classified as a developing economy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with its economy largely dependent on natural resources.",
        "• As of 2018, natural resource extraction accounted for 28% of PNG's overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with key contributors including minerals, oil, and natural gas.",
        "• The Investment Promotion Authority of Papua New Guinea identifies the major economic sectors as agriculture and livestock, forestry, mining and petroleum, tourism and hospitality, fisheries and marine resources, manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling, building and construction, transport and telecommunications, and finance and business trade.",
        "• PNG's economy is generally divided into subsistence and market sectors, though this distinction is blurred by smallholder cash cropping of coffee, cocoa, and copra.",
        "• Approximately 75% of PNG's population relies primarily on the subsistence economy for their livelihood.",
        "• The minerals, timber, and fish sectors are predominantly dominated by foreign investors, while manufacturing remains limited, resulting in a correspondingly limited formal labor sector.",
        "• Timber and marine resources are significant exports for PNG; the country is one of the few global suppliers of tropical timber.",
        "• The forestry industry in PNG is important economically but employs low and semi-intensive technological inputs, limiting product ranges to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts, and wood chips, with only a few finished products exported.",
        "• Challenges in the forestry sector include lack of automated machinery, inadequately trained local technical personnel, legal uncertainties, and corruption, with estimates suggesting up to 70% of logging may be illegal.",
        "• Marine fisheries contribute significantly, with PNG providing around 10% of the global fish catch, including a large portion of the world’s major tuna stocks.",
        "• Renewable resources such as forests, marine resources, and agriculture remain important, with agriculture providing livelihoods for 85% of the population and contributing approximately 30% of GDP.",
        "• Oil palm production has grown steadily in recent years, primarily from estates and extensive outgrower output, making palm oil the main agricultural export.",
        "• Coffee remains PNG's major export crop, largely produced in the Highlands provinces, followed by cocoa and coconut oil/copra from coastal areas, both mainly produced by smallholders; tea is produced on estates, and rubber is also cultivated.",
        "• Measuring PNG's economic growth is complicated due to distortions in GDP caused by the resource-dependent economy, and other metrics such as Gross National Income are difficult to measure accurately.",
        "• Historical GDP estimates for PNG have changed dramatically over time, reflecting measurement challenges.",
        "• In 2019, PNG's real GDP growth rate was 3.8%, with an inflation rate of 4.3%.",
        "• This economic growth has been primarily driven by strong commodity prices, especially minerals and agricultural products, supported by buoyant Asian markets.",
        "• The mining sector has been booming, and there has been a positive outlook due to the construction phase of natural gas exploration, production, and exportation in liquefied natural gas (LNG) form, involving multibillion-dollar investments in exploration, production wells, pipelines, storage, liquefaction plants, port terminals, and LNG tanker ships.",
        "• Formal employment levels in PNG are low; although a minimum wage exists, it has declined in real terms since independence.",
        "• In the late 2010s, approximately 40% of employed persons in urban areas worked outside agriculture, compared to only about 20% in rural areas.",
        "• The Papua New Guinean kina is managed through a crawling peg exchange rate system, with its value heavily influenced by the country's natural resource exports.",
        "• PNG's largest bilateral trade partner is Australia, followed by Japan and then China."

        "• A second major gas project is based on initial rights held by French oil and gas company TotalEnergies and U.S. company InterOil Corp. (IOC); in December 2013, TotalEnergies agreed to purchase 61.3% of IOC’s Antelope and Elk gas field rights with plans to develop these starting in 2016, including constructing a liquefaction plant for LNG export.",
