        "• Although _keiretsu_ still exist, they are less centralized and integrated than before the 1990s.",
        "• The weakening of _keiretsu_ structures has facilitated a rise in corporate acquisitions in Japan, as companies can no longer rely on banks for bailouts.",
        "• Additionally, there has been an increase in derivative litigation by more independent shareholders, reflecting a shift toward more open corporate governance."
