        "• Foodcrops hold greater economic importance than exported cash crops; for example, annual cassava production, the staple food for most Central Africans, ranges between approximately 200,000 and 300,000 tons.",
        "• In contrast, cotton, the principal exported cash crop, has a significantly lower production volume, ranging from about 25,000 to 45,000 tons annually.",
        "• Although foodcrops are not exported in large quantities, they remain the principal cash crops because Central Africans earn more income from selling surplus foodcrops periodically than from exported cash crops like cotton or coffee.",

        "• The presence of foreign personnel and organizations, including peacekeepers and refugee camps, constitutes a significant source of revenue for many Central Africans.",
        "• Since gaining independence 40 years ago, the CAR has experienced slow economic development due to factors such as economic mismanagement, poor infrastructure, a limited tax base, scarce private investment, and adverse external conditions.",
