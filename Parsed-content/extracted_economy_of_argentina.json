        "• Prior to the 1880s, Argentina's economy was relatively isolated, relying heavily on salted meat, wool, leather, and hide industries for foreign exchange earnings and domestic income.",
        "• Post-1880, Argentina experienced rapid economic growth driven by the export of livestock and grain raw materials, alongside significant British and French investments, initiating a fifty-year period of substantial economic expansion and mass European immigration.",
        "• Between 1880 and 1905, Argentina's GDP grew 7.5 times during its most vigorous phase, with an average annual growth rate of about 8%.",
        "• During this period, GDP per capita increased from 35% of the U.S. average to approximately 80%.",
        "• After 1905, growth slowed considerably; by 1941, Argentina's real per capita GDP was roughly half that of the United States.",
        "• From 1890 to 1950, Argentina's per capita income was comparable to Western Europe, although income distribution remained highly unequal.",
        "• A 2009 study by Baten, Pelger, and Twrdek indicated that Argentina's GDP increased after 1870 based on anthropometric data (height and real wages), but heights remained unaffected before 1910, suggesting welfare improvements did not occur during income expansion in that earlier period.",
        "• The Great Depression (1929–1932) caused Argentina's GDP to decline by 25%.",
        "• By the late 1930s, the economy recovered partly through import substitution, and during World War II, it experienced modest growth despite global recession impacts.",
        "• WWII led to reduced import availability and higher export prices, resulting in a US$1.6 billion cumulative trade surplus, with one-third of this surplus blocked as inconvertible deposits in the Bank of England due to the Roca–Runciman Treaty.",
        "• Manufacturing value-added surpassed agriculture for the first time in 1943, employing over 1 million workers by 1947, and reduced the need for imported consumer goods from 40% to 10% by 1950.",

        "• From 1975 to 1990, Argentina experienced severe stagflation, hyperinflation in 1989–1990, and a debt crisis culminating in default in 2001, with GDP declining nearly 20% over four years, unemployment reaching 25%, and the peso depreciating 70%.",
        "• Post-2003, Argentina's economy rebounded due to expansionary policies and raw material exports, creating over five million jobs, and restoring social programs and renationalizing key firms such as the postal service, ASA, pension funds, Aerolíneas Argentinas, YPF, and railways.",
        "• From 2002 to 2011, Argentina's GDP nearly doubled, growing at an average of 7.1% annually, with five consecutive years of approximately 9% growth from 2003 to 2007.",

        "• The 2008 global financial crisis slowed growth to nearly zero in 2009, but GDP expanded around 9% in both 2010 and 2011.",
        "• From 2012 onward, growth slowed to an average of 1.3% (2012–2014), rising slightly to 2.4% in 2015, due to external shocks, exchange controls, austerity, and inflation.",
        "• Argentina's bond market is based on GDP-linked bonds; in 2005 and 2010, debt restructuring resumed payments on nearly US$100 billion in defaulted bonds, with holdouts led by Paul Singer's NML Capital Limited rejecting swaps and attempting asset seizures.",
        "• By 2012, bondholders who accepted the 2005 exchange received about 90% returns; Argentina settled with holdouts in February 2016 at a cost of US$9.3 billion, with NML receiving US$2.4 billion, a 392% return.",
        "• Argentina considers illegitimate government debt as odious but continues servicing it, costing approximately US$14 billion annually, with bond issues since 2002 averaging less than US$2 billion per year, limiting debt rollover capacity.",

        "• During the COVID-19 quarantine in April 2020, approximately 143,000 SMEs could not pay salaries and expenses, with about 35,000 considering closure, despite government assistance; some projects estimated 180 total quarantine days and a 5% company failure rate in May.",
        "• In February 2023, inflation surpassed 100% for the first time since the early 1990s.",
        "• By December 2023, Argentina's projected annual inflation rate was 200%, with President Javier Milei implementing policies including a 50% weakening of the peso to 800 per dollar, energy subsidy cuts, public works cancellations, and expense reductions, resulting in a budget surplus for the first time since 2012.",
        "• Milei's policies are characterized by extreme economic reforms, with him describing himself as an anarcho-capitalist; in April 2024, the government announced a plan to cut 15,000 public sector jobs.",
        "• Argentina's 2023 inflation was the highest globally at 211.4%.",
        "• In January 2024, the poverty rate reached 57.4%, the highest since 2004.",
        "• By December 2024, the monthly inflation rate decreased to 2.4%, ending hyperinflation, and the poverty rate fell to 38.9% in the third quarter, with projections of further decline as reforms take effect.",
        "• A December 2024 Gallup poll showed over 50% approval for Milei, with trust in government doubling since 2023, and 53% of Argentinians perceiving an improved standard of living, comparable to 2015.",
        "• Despite improvements, 69% of Argentinians believe it is a bad time to seek employment, and 35% lack sufficient funds for food, though these figures are lower than their 2019 peaks.",
        "• Approval ratings for Milei are higher among the top 20% (59%) than the bottom 20% (39%), but both are higher than ratings for his predecessor, Alberto Fernández.",
        "• In early 2024, Argentina's GDP contracted by 2.1% in Q1 and 1.8% in Q2, but expanded by 3.9% in Q4, driven by a 80.2% rebound in agriculture following a drought.",
