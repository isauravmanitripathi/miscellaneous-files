        "• Despite these challenges, the government has prioritized large-scale, private sector-led industrial agricultural schemes over developing smallholder agricultural extension services to increase food production.",
        "• Donor countries advocate industrial farming as the key to improving food security; for instance, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) collaborates with Citibank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Corporate Council on Africa to help South Sudan market its resources and attract private capital in agriculture.",
