        "• Since gaining independence, the Mauritian economy has transformed from a poor nation with high unemployment and an economy reliant mainly on sugar exports, vulnerable to fluctuations in global demand, into a relatively prosperous and diversified economy, albeit with ongoing challenges.",
        "• During the 1970s, the Mauritian government demonstrated a strong commitment to economic diversification and the creation of higher-paying jobs for its population, focusing on promoting tourism and establishing Export Processing Zones (EPZs) to achieve these objectives.",
        "• Between 1971 and 1977, approximately 64,000 jobs were created in Mauritius, largely due to government initiatives promoting tourism and EPZ development.",
        "• In the rapid expansion of employment through EPZ firms, the government permitted these firms to deny workers fair wages, the right to organize and strike, and access to health and social benefits that were otherwise available to other Mauritian workers.",
        "• The mid-1970s economic boom was supported by increased foreign aid, exceptional sugar crop yields, and high world sugar prices.",
        "• The economic situation worsened in the late 1970s due to rising petroleum prices, the end of the sugar boom, and a growing balance of payments deficit caused by imports exceeding exports; by 1979, this deficit reached US$111 million.",
        "• Facing economic difficulties, Mauritius sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, agreeing to implement austerity measures including cutting food subsidies, devaluing the currency, and limiting government wage increases in exchange for loans and credits to finance imports.",
        "• In the 1980s, a broad political consensus on economic policies facilitated steady economic growth, reduced inflation, high employment levels, and increased domestic savings in Mauritius.",
        "• The EPZ sector, with significant investment from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, became the leading export-earning sector in Mauritius during the 1980s, surpassing sugar exports and employing more workers than the sugar industry and government combined, which had previously been the two largest employers.",
        "• In 1986, Mauritius recorded its first trade surplus in twelve years, marking a significant economic milestone.",
        "• The tourism sector experienced substantial growth in the 1980s, accompanied by an expansion in hotel capacity and increased air traffic, contributing to the country’s economic optimism.",

        "• Strategic decisions regarding liberalisation and economic policies in Mauritius have been evidence-based and adapted according to outcomes, ensuring consistency and stability irrespective of the ruling political party.",
        "• The liberalisation process in Mauritius occurred in distinct phases, each designed to capitalize on the country’s existing international market advantages.",
        "• In the 1970s, Mauritius benefited significantly from sugar rents and established an Export Processing Zone (EPZ), successfully attracting capital and foreign investment in manufacturing from investors originating from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.",
        "• During the 1980s and 1990s, the EPZ expanded substantially, resulting in a marked increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) and growth in the tourism sector.",
        "• Preferential access to sugar and clothing markets during the 1980s accounted for approximately 7% of Mauritius’s GDP, decreasing to 4.5% in the 1990s.",
        "• Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Mauritius liberalised its capital and current accounts, which contributed to an investment and employment boom; the high inflow of FDI during this period also facilitated the transfer of managerial skills to the local economy.",
        "• Between the 1990s and 2010, Mauritius pursued further economic diversification, liberalisation, and investment initiatives, coinciding with the withdrawal of Chinese investors who redirected their investments toward Africa and China."
