        "• Between 1981 and 1986, Oman increased oil production to 600,000 barrels per day to compensate for declining oil prices; however, the 1986 oil price collapse caused revenues to drop dramatically.",

        "• The World Bank projects economic growth to increase over 2020–2021, driven partly by a large increase in gas production from the new Khazzan gas project and infrastructure spending in both oil and non-oil sectors.",
        "• With Khazzan phase-I operational, natural gas under the petroleum sector is becoming a significant contributor to Oman’s economy, with BP committing US$16 billion to develop the field.",

        "• Omanisation efforts in the private sector face challenges, notably the continued employment of expatriates due to their acceptance of lower wages compared to Omani nationals.",
        "• Studies indicate that many private sector job openings offer only the official minimum salary for nationals, which is considered unattractive by local job seekers, hindering Omanisation progress.",
        "• Another obstacle to Omanisation in the private sector is the difficulty in placing Omani workers in senior positions, as a large portion of the Omani workforce consists of young and inexperienced employees."
