        "• Lesotho’s trade deficit remains large, with exports constituting only a small fraction of imports.",
        "• The global economic crisis negatively impacted Lesotho’s economy through multiple channels: loss of textile exports and jobs due to the U.S. economic slowdown (a major export market), reduced diamond mining and exports amid weak diamond prices, decreased Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues due to South Africa’s economic slowdown, and reduced worker remittances caused by contraction in South Africa’s mining sector and related job losses.",
        "• In 2009, Lesotho’s GDP growth slowed significantly to 0.9 percent."
