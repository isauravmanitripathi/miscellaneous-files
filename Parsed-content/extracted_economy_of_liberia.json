        "• The economy of Liberia is extremely underdeveloped, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of only $3.222 billion as of 2019, primarily due to the impacts of the First Liberian Civil War (1989–1996) and the Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003).",
        "• According to the United Nations, Liberia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.",
        "• Prior to 1979, Liberia's economy was among the more developed and fastest-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
        "• The 1980 coup d'état precipitated a decline in Liberia’s economy, which was further devastated by the civil wars that destroyed much of the country's economy and infrastructure, especially in and around the capital city, Monrovia.",
        "• The civil wars caused a significant brain drain and loss of capital, as the conflicts involved the overthrow of the Americo-Liberian minority that had ruled the country; although some expatriates returned after 1997, many did not.",
        "• Liberia is richly endowed with natural resources, including abundant water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture.",
        "• Despite these natural endowments, Liberia suffers from deficiencies in human capital, infrastructure, and political stability.",
        "• Liberia’s economic profile is fairly typical of Sub-Saharan African economies, with the majority of the population dependent on subsistence agriculture.",
        "• Liberia’s exports are dominated by raw commodities, notably rubber and iron ore.",
        "• Local manufacturing in Liberia is limited and primarily foreign-owned.",
        "• The democratically elected government installed in August 1997 inherited massive international debts.",
        "• Liberia relies heavily on revenues from its maritime registry to provide the bulk of its foreign exchange earnings.",
        "• The restoration of Liberia’s infrastructure and the improvement of incomes depend on the implementation of sound macroeconomic and microeconomic policies by the government, including the encouragement of foreign investment."

        "• Independent Liberia's economic history suffers from limited archival documentation, complicating comprehensive assessments by economic historians; the Liberian government only began producing GDP per capita data in 1964.",
        "• A 2022 study by LSE economic historian Leigh A. Gardner estimated Liberia's GDP per capita at $430 in 1845, which was just above subsistence level and approximately half of Japan's GDP per capita at that time.",
        "• Liberia's GDP per capita rose to approximately $500 by the time of independence (circa 1847), but the economy stagnated until the 1930s, when a period of rapid economic growth commenced.",
        "• During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liberia was poorer than Ghana; however, by 1950 Liberia had caught up with Ghana and subsequently diverged, becoming almost twice as wealthy as Ghana by 1970.",
        "• The Liberian economy stagnated throughout the 1970s after the period of growth in the mid-20th century.",
        "• In 1926, the Liberian government granted the Firestone Tire Company the right to lease up to 1 million acres of land for 99 years at a cost of 6 cents per acre.",
        "• Firestone developed significant influence over the Liberian government, effectively gaining control over its finances during this period, and became a major source of foreign investment in Liberia.",
        "• Firestone established rubber tree plantations in Liberia using the non-native South American rubber tree species, _Hevea brasiliensis_.",
        "• By the 1950s, Firestone was Liberia's largest private employer and largest exporter; in 1955, Vincent Browne reported that rubber accounted for over $45,000,000 of Liberia's approximately $55,000,000 worth of exports.",
        "• Post-World War II, Liberia became one of the world's largest rubber exporters; today, Firestone's rubber plantation in Liberia is the world's largest contiguous rubber plantation, operated by the Firestone Natural Rubber Company, a subsidiary of Bridgestone.",

        "• Economic historian George Dalton estimated in 1965 that Liberia received more U.S. aid per capita than any other African country.",
        "• After World War II, Liberia sought to become a destination for offshore services by loosening laws related to ship registration, corporations, and taxes.",
        "• By the 1960s, Liberia had become the largest ship registry in the world in terms of tonnage, reflecting the success of its shipping registry.",
        "• Prior to the civil war, Liberia's economy heavily relied on iron ore mining; by the 1970s, iron mining accounted for more than half of Liberia's export earnings.",
        "• Since the 1980 coup d'état, Liberia's economic growth slowed due to a decline in global demand for iron ore and political upheavals within the country.",
        "• Following the end of the civil war in 2003, Liberia's GDP growth accelerated, peaking at 9.4% in 2007.",
        "• During the Great Recession in 2009, GDP growth slowed to 4.6%, but a strengthening agricultural sector led by rubber and timber exports increased growth to 5.1% in 2010 and an expected 7.3% in 2011, positioning Liberia among the 20 fastest-growing economies globally.",
        "• In March 2010, Bob Johnson, founder of BET, funded the construction of the first hotel built in Liberia in 20 years; the 13-acre (53,000 m²) luxury resort was established in the Paynesville section of Monrovia.",
        "• Liberia's external debt was estimated at approximately $4.5 billion in 2006, equating to 800% of GDP.",
        "• Due to bilateral, multilateral, and commercial debt relief efforts from 2007 to 2010, Liberia's external debt was reduced to $222.9 million by 2011."
