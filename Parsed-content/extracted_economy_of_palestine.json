        "• The WBGS experienced economic deterioration in the early 1990s, with real per capita GDP declining by 36.1% between 1992 and 1996 due to falling aggregate incomes combined with rapid population growth.",
        "• The economic downturn was primarily caused by Israeli closure policies implemented in response to terrorist attacks in Israel, which disrupted established labor and commodity market linkages between Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
        "• A critical consequence of these disruptions was the rise of chronic unemployment in the WBGS; average unemployment rates, which had been below 5% during the 1980s, surged to over 20% by the mid-1990s.",

        "• At least 1.5 million Palestinian pounds in the form of physical banknotes were brought into Palestine prior to the abolition of the Palestinian currency, indicating that individuals who left Palestine took physical cash with them.",
        "• Similar transfers of physical banknotes occurred to Syria (at least 1.5 million pounds), with smaller amounts sent to Egypt and Iraq, reflecting the movement of Palestinian refugees and migrants carrying cash assets to these countries."

        "• Palestinian exports reached their peak in 1981 but subsequently declined throughout the 1990s, while imports nearly doubled during the same period, causing the trade deficit to widen from 35% of GDP in 1981 to 45% of GDP in 1996.",
