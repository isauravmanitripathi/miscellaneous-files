        "• During the 1970s, Brunei experienced a significant increase in revenues from petroleum exports, which enabled the government to maintain low and constant spending levels.",
        "• This fiscal strategy allowed the government to accumulate foreign reserves and invest them globally to secure future economic stability.",
        "• A portion of the reserve earnings was reportedly utilized to finance the government’s annual budget deficit, indicating a reliance on petroleum revenues for fiscal balance.",
        "• Since 1986, petroleum revenues in Brunei have declined, leading to increased government expenditure and a persistent budget deficit starting from 1988.",
        "• The cessation of a revenue surplus has heightened Brunei’s economic vulnerability to fluctuations in petroleum prices.",
        "• Brunei’s GDP surged in the 1970s with rising petroleum prices, reaching a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980.",
        "• After 1980, GDP declined slightly over the next five years and then fell by nearly 30% in 1986, primarily due to sharply lower global petroleum prices and voluntary production cuts by Brunei.",
        "• The GDP showed signs of recovery post-1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989.",
        "• In recent years, GDP growth rates were 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an estimated 2.5% in 1999, with 1999 GDP approximately $4.5 billion, still below the 1980 peak.",
        "• The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, combined with oil price fluctuations, created economic uncertainty and instability in Brunei.",
        "• The 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei’s largest construction firm, which contributed significantly to domestic economic activity, led to a mild recession.",
        "• The IMF-estimated trend of Brunei’s GDP at market prices shows an increase from 1985’s $7,777 million Brunei dollars to 2005’s $10,401 million Brunei dollars, with corresponding US dollar exchange rates and inflation indices.",

        "• The government restricts foreign labor immigration to prevent societal disruption, issuing short-term work permits that require continual renewal, yet foreigners constituted a significant portion of the workforce, with a total of 122,800 workers in 1999 and an unemployment rate of 5.5%.",
        "• Brunei’s exports are almost entirely composed of oil and natural gas, with limited local production of other products, necessitating substantial imports.",
        "• Singapore was the largest source of imports in 1997, accounting for 25%, though this figure includes transshipments through Singapore; Japan and Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers, with Japan dominating markets for motor vehicles, construction equipment, electronics, and household appliances.",
        "• The United States was the third-largest import supplier in 1998.",
        "• The Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), under the Ministry of Finance and Economy, manages the country’s foreign reserves, aiming to increase their real value through diversified investments in the US, Japan, Western Europe, and ASEAN countries.",
        "• The government actively encourages foreign investment, offering pioneer status—exempting profits from income tax for up to 5 years based on capital invested—and maintains a corporate income tax rate of 30%, with no personal income or capital gains taxes.",
        "• Promoting the development of Brunei Malays as industry and commerce leaders is a key government priority; while there are no explicit restrictions on foreign equity ownership, local participation in capital and management is encouraged to facilitate government and Shell Petroleum contracts.",
        "• Companies must be incorporated locally or registered as foreign branches, with registration overseen by the Registrar of Companies; public companies require at least seven shareholders, private companies between two and fifty shareholders, and at least half of directors must be residents.",
        "• Between 1981 and 2013, the Sultan owned cattle stations in Australia, covering over 2,262 square miles (5,860 km²), larger than Brunei itself, with some stations sold in 2006 and 2014; as of 2019, the Sultan still owned the Opium Creek station.",
