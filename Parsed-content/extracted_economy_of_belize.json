        "• Belize's economy was predominantly reliant on forestry until well into the 20th century.",
        "• The initial main export of Belize was logwood, which was used to produce dye.",
        "• The supply of logwood eventually exceeded demand, especially as Europeans developed cheaper, man-made dyes, leading to a decline in logwood exports.",
        "• As demand for logwood decreased, loggers shifted focus to mahogany, which grew abundantly in Belize's forests.",
        "• Mahogany was highly valued for use in making cabinets, ships, and railroad carriers.",
        "• Wealth in Belize during this period was concentrated among merchants and traders involved in the mahogany industry.",
        "• Market fluctuations significantly impacted the Belizean economy, with periods of boom and bust tied to mahogany export levels.",
        "• The natural growth rate of mahogany trees was slow, and no large-scale replanting efforts were undertaken, necessitating long-term investments in tree farming that were not made.",
        "• As the 19th century advanced, loggers had to venture deeper into forests to find mahogany, increasing labor costs.",
        "• Variations in mahogany exports over extended periods were linked to the accessible supply of the resource.",
        "• Improvements in hauling methods, such as the introduction of cattle in the early 19th century, tractors in the 1920s, and lorries in the 1940s, dramatically increased production levels by enabling access to previously unreachable interior areas.",
        "• When the accessible timber supply diminished and logging became unprofitable in the 20th century, Belize's economy transitioned to other sectors.",
        "• The principal export shifted to cane sugar, which became the dominant sector.",
        "• Recently, Belize's economy has expanded to include citrus, bananas, seafood, and apparel production.",
        "• Belize has approximately 8,090 square kilometers of arable land, but only a small fraction is under cultivation.",
        "• To prevent land speculation, the Belizean government enacted legislation in 1973 requiring non-Belizeans to submit a development plan before acquiring land.",
        "• The legislation stipulates that non-Belizeans must complete a development plan to obtain title to plots of more than 10 acres (40,000 m²) of rural land or more than one-half acre (2,000 m²) of urban land."
