        "• The establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924 marked the beginning of a centrally planned economy, which initially led to modest growth in GDP per capita through state-led industrial and agricultural development.",
        "• From the 1950s to the 1980s, Mongolia experienced steady increases in real GDP per capita due to Soviet aid, investments in mining, infrastructure, and collectivized agriculture, although growth rates were relatively moderate compared to global standards.",
        "• The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 precipitated a severe economic crisis in Mongolia, causing a sharp decline in real GDP per capita as state subsidies and trade links were disrupted.",
        "• The transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented system in the 1990s involved significant economic reforms, including privatization and liberalization, which initially resulted in economic contraction and a decrease in GDP per capita.",
