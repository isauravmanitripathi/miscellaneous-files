        "• In January 2025, Xi Jinping's aide Cai Qi ordered propaganda officials to block negative economic news.",
        "• A 2019 research paper published by the Brookings Institution suggested that adjusting China's GDP time series using value-added tax data—considered highly resistant to fraud—indicates that China's economic growth may have been overstated by 1.7% annually between 2008 and 2016, leading to an overstatement of the economy's size by 12–16% in 2016.",

        "• Rhodium estimates that China's actual GDP growth in 2024 ranged between 2.4% and 2.8%, substantially lower than the official claim of 4.8%, indicating an overstatement of approximately 2 percentage points annually since at least 2022.",
        "• If Rhodium's adjustments are accurate, China's economy could be around 10% smaller than reported since their tracking began, equating to a reduction of approximately $1.7 trillion in GDP.",
        "• The discrepancies are attributed to collapsing real estate activity, declining local government investment, and weak household consumption, which official data fail to fully capture, thus misleadingly portraying stable growth.",
        "• In 2024, property sector declines and infrastructure investment reductions were significant, yet official figures suggested stable contributions from these sectors.",
        "• Official data also overstate government fiscal spending and household consumption, which Rhodium argues are critical indicators of economic health, and these were actually far weaker than reported.",
        "• A 2015 study by Daniel H. Rosen and Beibei Bao indicated that China's GDP in 2008 was actually 13–16% larger than official data, and the 2013 GDP was closer to $10.5 trillion rather than the official $9.5 trillion.",
        "• Arvind Subramanian, a former IMF economist and Peterson Institute senior fellow, estimated that China's GDP by Purchasing Power Parity in 2010 was about $14.8 trillion, significantly higher than the IMF's official estimate of $10.1 trillion, implying that China's GDP was underestimated by approximately 47%."
