        "• Since the early 1990s, two key developments transformed Israel’s economy: waves of Jewish immigration from the former USSR, bringing over one million highly educated immigrants, now constituting about 15% of the population, and the peace process initiated at the Madrid conference of October 1991, culminating in the 1994 peace treaty with Jordan.",
        "• The influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants contributed significant scientific and technical expertise, bolstering Israel’s burgeoning technology sector.",
        "• In the early 2000s, Israel’s economy declined due to the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the Second Intifada, which increased security costs and reduced investment and tourism, causing unemployment to reach double digits; in one quarter of 2000, growth was 10%, and in 2002, the economy shrank by about 4% in one quarter.",

        "• Israel’s economic resilience is attributed to its status as a net lender, conservative macroeconomic policies by the government and the Bank of Israel, and strategic financial regulations.",
        "• Notably, the government resisted pressure from banks to allocate large sums of public money to bail them out early in the crisis, limiting risky banking behavior.",
        "• The implementation of recommendations from the Bach’ar commission in the early to mid-2000s, which advocated for separating banks’ depository and investment activities, helped reduce systemic risk; this contrasted with the U.S. trend of easing such restrictions, which increased risk-taking in American financial systems.",
