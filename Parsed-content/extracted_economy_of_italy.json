        "• In the decades following Italy's unification, northern regions such as Lombardy, Piedmont, and Liguria experienced rapid industrialization and economic development, whereas southern regions lagged behind.",
        "• At the time of unification, the south faced a shortage of entrepreneurs; landowners were often absent from their farms, residing in cities, and managed their estates through managers who were not incentivized to maximize agricultural productivity.",
        "• Southern landowners prioritized investments in low-risk government bonds over agricultural equipment, contributing to economic stagnation in the region.",

        "• Public spending was financed through highly unbalanced land property taxes, which heavily taxed landowners but failed to accurately assess land profitability due to regional cadastral disparities, deepening regional economic gaps.",
        "• These tax policies damaged the relationship between the central government and the southern population, leading to civil unrest known as Brigandage, which caused approximately 20,000 victims by 1864, followed by militarization and increased emigration from 1892 to 1921.",

        "• During Mussolini’s regime, the \"Iron Prefect\" Cesare Mori attempted to suppress powerful criminal organizations in the south with some success; fascist policies aimed at creating an Italian Empire, with southern ports being strategic for colonial trade.",
        "• The Allied invasion of southern Italy during World War II restored mafia influence, which had been suppressed during Fascist rule, and they were used to maintain public order.",
        "• Mussolini enforced laws promoting standard Italian in schools and discouraged the use of local dialects and Sicilian language, aiming for linguistic homogenization nationwide.",
        "• In the 1950s, the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno was established as a large public development plan to industrialize the south through land reforms creating 120,000 smallholdings and a \"Growth Pole Strategy\" allocating 60% of government investment to the south to attract capital, stimulate local firms, and generate employment.",
        "• The objectives of the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno largely failed; the south became increasingly dependent on subsidies and the state, lacking the capacity for private sector growth.",
        "• The economic gap between the north and south narrowed during the 1960s and 1970s due to infrastructure development, agrarian and educational reforms, industrial expansion, and improved living conditions, but this convergence was interrupted in the 1980s.",
        "• Currently, the per capita GDP of the south is approximately 58% of that of the center-north, though the south benefits from a cost of living that is about 10–15% lower, with greater disparities between small towns and large cities.",
