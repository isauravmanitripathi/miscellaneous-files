        "• At the beginning of the 20th century, present-day Armenia was primarily an agricultural region with some copper mining and cognac production.",
        "• Between 1914 and 1921, Caucasian Armenia experienced a genocide that resulted in approximately 1.5 million Armenian deaths and caused a total economic collapse due to the confiscation of assets by the Turks.",
        "• The genocide's consequences, including revolution, refugee influx, disease, hunger, and economic misery, remain incalculable after 105 years; about 200,000 Armenians died in 1919 alone.",
        "• American relief efforts in 1919 played a crucial role in preventing Armenia's total collapse during this period.",
        "• Prior to the genocide, Armenians were the second wealthiest ethnic group in Anatolia after the Greeks, heavily involved in banking, architecture, and trade.",
        "• The genocide in April 1915 and the targeting of Armenian intellectuals devastated the population and economy, leading to significant loss of skilled human capital.",
        "• The first Soviet Armenian government implemented strict economic regulation, including nationalization of enterprises, requisitioning grain from peasants, and suppression of private market activity.",
        "• This initial Soviet economic control ended with Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1921–1927, which maintained state control over large enterprises and banks but allowed peasants to sell surplus grain and small businesses to operate.",
        "• During the NEP years, Armenia experienced partial economic recovery; by 1926, agricultural production reached nearly 75% of prewar levels.",
        "• By the late 1920s, Stalin's regime revoked the NEP, re-establishing centralized state monopoly over all economic activity in Armenia.",
        "• Under Stalin, the primary goal was transforming Armenia from an agrarian society into an industrial and urban one, with peasants now required to sell nearly all output to state procurement agencies.",
        "• From the 1930s to the 1960s, Armenia developed an industrial infrastructure including hydroelectric plants, canals, roads, and gas pipelines connecting to Azerbaijan and Russia.",
        "• The Soviet socialist command economy persisted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, characterized by suppressed market forces and centralized planning.",
        "• Between 1929 and 1939, Armenia's industrial workforce increased from 13% to 31%, and by 1935, industry contributed 62% of the republic’s economic output.",
        "• Throughout the Soviet era, Armenia's economy remained highly integrated within the Soviet barter system, showing little signs of self-sufficiency; in 1988, Armenia produced only 0.9% of the Soviet Union’s net material product, with 1.2% from industry and 0.7% from agriculture.",
        "• Armenia's share of total Soviet state budget revenue was 1.4%, and it exported only 1.4% of its production outside the USSR.",
        "• Agriculture constituted approximately 20% of Armenia’s net material product and 10% of employment before the 1991 Soviet breakup.",
        "• Armenia's industry was heavily dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex, with about 40% of enterprises dedicated to defense; many factories lost 60–80% of their business in the late Soviet period due to defense budget cuts.",
        "• In the mid-1990s, Armenia faced significant industrial liabilities, including outdated equipment, infrastructure deficiencies, and pollution from heavy industrial plants, hindering competitiveness in global markets.",
        "• The economic downturn intensified in 1992, with GDP declining by 37.5% in 1991 compared to 1990, and all sectors contributing to GDP experiencing decreased production.",
        "• The collapse of industry in favor of import-dependent agriculture altered Armenia’s sectoral contribution to GDP during this period.",
        "• In 1991, Armenia's last Soviet year, national income decreased by 12% from the previous year, with per capita gross national product at 4,920 rubles—only 68% of the Soviet average.",
        "• The 1988 earthquake, the Azerbaijani blockade starting in 1989, and the collapse of the Soviet international trade system caused Armenia’s early 1990s economy to remain well below 1980 levels.",
        "• During 1992–93, Armenia experienced extremely high inflation, significant drops in productivity and national income, and large deficits in the national budget.",
        "• Early post-independence shortages led to price deregulation, with inflation rates rising from 10% in 1990 to 100% in 1991, and reaching 642.5% in the first four months of 1992, compared to the same period in 1991.",
        "• The economic crisis was characterized by conflicting dynamics: rising prices due to shortages and falling incomes due to recession and unemployment."

        "• Armenia began introducing elements of the free market and privatization into its economic system in the late 1980s, coinciding with Mikhail Gorbachev's advocacy of economic reform.",
        "• The initial reform measures included land reform and land privatization, enabling small-parcel agriculture to supply markets and support self-sustenance amid shortages.",
        "• Cooperatives were established in the service sector, notably in restaurants, but faced substantial resistance from the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA) and other privileged groups from the old economy.",
        "• By the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy was already operating semi-officially or illegally, characterized by widespread corruption and bribery, with a mafia composed of interconnected groups of officials, relatives, and friends sabotaging reform efforts.",
        "• During the December 1988 earthquake, which caused extensive destruction and displaced over 25,000 people, foreign aid totaling millions of dollars was largely diverted to corrupt and criminal elements.",
        "• Starting in 1991, Armenia’s democratically elected government actively promoted privatization and market reforms, but faced obstacles such as entrenched old business practices, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs associated with the First Nagorno-Karabakh War.",
        "• In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatization committee with representatives from all political parties.",
        "• In mid-1993, the committee announced a two-year privatization program targeting 30% of state enterprises—mainly services and light industries—in the first stage, with the remaining 70% to be privatized later with minimal government restrictions to foster private initiative.",
        "• The privatization scheme allocated 20% of each enterprise’s property to workers free of charge, 30% to citizens via vouchers, and 50% to the government with a preference for labor organization members.",
        "• A significant challenge of the privatization system was the absence of supporting legislation on foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.",
        "• Early efforts to attract foreign investment through joint enterprises were only moderately successful due to the Azerbaijani blockade and energy shortages; a department of foreign investment was established in the Ministry of Economy in late 1993 to promote investment opportunities and improve legal infrastructure.",
        "• The department aimed to develop a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.",
        "• Diaspora Armenians made large-scale investments, including a toy factory, construction projects, a cold storage plant (initially with limited produce), and the American University of Armenia in Yerevan to teach market economy techniques.",
        "• Armenia joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in May 1992 and the World Bank in September 1992; by 1993, the government criticized these organizations for delaying financial aid and announced plans to liberalize prices and eliminate tariffs, quotas, and trade restrictions.",
        "• Despite economic slowdown due to the collapse, Prime Minister Hrant Bagratyan in fall 1993 announced plans to renew privatization efforts by the end of that year.",
        "• Armenia’s economy inherited the legacy of a centrally planned system and the collapse of Soviet trading patterns, with Soviet industrial support virtually vanished, leaving few major enterprises operational.",
        "• The 1988 earthquake, which resulted in over 25,000 deaths and 500,000 homeless, continued to impact the economy, compounded by unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and a blockade along Azerbaijani and Turkish borders.",
        "• Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey were closed, forcing reliance on routes through Georgia and Iran, which were adequate and reliable.",
        "• Between 1992–93, Armenia’s GDP declined nearly 60% from its 1989 level; the national currency, the dram, experienced hyperinflation in its initial years after introduction in 1993.",
        "• Since 1995, Armenia experienced strong economic growth and negligible inflation, with new sectors emerging such as precious stone processing, jewelry making, and communication technology (notably Armentel, a former USSR asset owned by external investors).",
        "• This steady growth garnered increased support from international institutions, with total loans exceeding $800 million since 1993, aimed at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the currency, developing private businesses, and rehabilitating earthquake-affected zones.",
        "• By 1994, Armenia launched an IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program, leading to positive GDP growth from 1995 to 2005, with GDP per capita rising from $350 to over $800 between 1995 and 2003.",
        "• The principal factors behind this growth included credible macroeconomic stabilization policies, economic correction after depression, and increased external transfers, especially post-2000.",
        "• Armenia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2003.",
        "• The country successfully reduced inflation, stabilized its currency, and privatized most small- and medium-sized enterprises, although unemployment remained high despite economic growth.",
        "• Early and mid-1990s energy shortages were mitigated by nuclear power from the Metsamor plant; Armenia is now a net energy exporter, but the plant faces international pressure to close due to its outdated design.",
        "• The European Union classified the Metsamor VVER 440 Model V230 reactor as the \"oldest and least reliable\" among Soviet reactors, but the IAEA has affirmed its safety and capacity to operate beyond its design lifespan.",
        "• The electricity distribution system was privatized in 2002."
