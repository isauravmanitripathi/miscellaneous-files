        "• For approximately 50 years leading up to World War II, the Belgian economy was characterized by a regional disparity: French-speaking Wallonia was a highly advanced industrial region concentrated along the sillon industriel, while Dutch-speaking Flanders was predominantly agricultural with some industry focused on processing agricultural products and textiles.",
        "• During the interwar period, this regional disparity began to diminish as economic development and industrialization efforts increased in Flanders.",
        "• Belgium emerged from World War II with its industrial infrastructure largely intact, thanks to the Galopin doctrine, which contributed to a favorable postwar recovery environment.",
        "• The postwar economic boom was significantly bolstered by the establishment of the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels, which stimulated economic activity.",
        "• The boom years led to rapid expansion of light industry across most of Flanders, especially along a corridor between Brussels and Antwerp, the latter being the second largest port in Europe after Rotterdam.",
        "• In the 1960s, foreign investment played a crucial role in Belgian economic growth, with U.S. firms leading the expansion of light industrial and petrochemical industries during the 1960s and 1970s.",
        "• Traditional industries in Wallonia, notably the steel industry, began to decline in competitiveness during this period; however, this decline was masked by overall global prosperity until the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979.",
        "• The 1973 and 1979 oil crises triggered shifts in international demand, leading to a prolonged recession in Belgium.",
        "• During the 1980s and 1990s, the economic focus continued shifting northward to Flanders, driven by investments from multinationals in the automotive and chemical industries, as well as growing local industrial agriculture for textiles and food production.",
        "• The early 1980s marked a difficult period of structural adjustment for Belgium, characterized by declining demand for traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglect of structural reforms.",
        "• The 1980–82 recession severely impacted Belgium, resulting in rising unemployment, increased social welfare costs, soaring personal debt, a government deficit reaching 13% of GDP, and a growing national debt, which was mostly domestically held.",
        "• In response, Prime Minister Martens' center-right coalition government introduced an economic recovery program in 1982 aimed at promoting export-led growth through an 8.5% devaluation of the Belgian franc.",
        "• Between 1984 and 1989, economic growth improved, rising from 2% to a peak of 4%.",
        "• In May 1990, Belgium linked its currency, the Belgian franc, to the Deutsche Mark, primarily by closely tracking German interest rates, which led to increased Belgian interest rates as German rates rose.",
        "• The linkage to the Deutsche Mark contributed to a slowdown in Belgium’s economic growth rate after 1990.",
        "• During 1992–93, Belgium experienced its worst recession since World War II, with real GDP declining by 0.96% in 1993.",
