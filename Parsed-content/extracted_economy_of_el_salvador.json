        "• The adoption of the U.S. dollar limited the government's ability to implement open market monetary policies aimed at influencing short-term economic variables.",
        "• By 2004, the Salvadoran colón ceased circulating and is no longer used in any transactions; however, some stores still display prices in both colons and U.S. dollars.",
        "• The switch to the U.S. dollar contributed to a trend of declining interest rates in El Salvador, facilitating easier access to credit for purchasing homes and vehicles.",
        "• Discontent with dollarization has largely diminished over time, though it occasionally resurfaces as a political issue during election periods.",
        "• In June 2021, President Nayib Bukele announced plans to introduce legislation to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador.",

        "• The 1992 peace accords mandated significant government expenditures on transition programs and social services.",
        "• President Cristiani’s administration initiated stability adjustment programs (PAE), which included privatization of banks, the pension system, electric, and telephone companies.",
        "• The complete privatization of the pension system created a fiscal burden because private Pension Association Funds did not cover all retired pensioners previously covered under the old system.",
        "• In July 2017, the Salvadoran government attempted to transfer US$500 million from the privatized pension system to cover pensioners from the old system, but the Supreme Court declared this move unconstitutional.",
        "• As a result, the government absorbed the costs of pension coverage and lost revenue from contributors, significantly contributing to fiscal imbalance.",
        "• The fiscal deficit has been financed through bond issuance, a practice opposed by the leftist FMLN party, leading to political debates and delays in approving the national budget.",
        "• In 2006, to address budget shortfalls, the government planned to finance the deficit by reducing expenditures rather than issuing bonds or taking loans, which require a qualified majority (3/4) in parliament for approval.",

        "• Despite fiscal challenges, El Salvador maintains one of the lowest tax burdens in the Americas, approximately 11% of GDP.",
        "• The government has prioritized improving revenue collection, focusing mainly on indirect taxes such as the value-added tax (VAT).",
