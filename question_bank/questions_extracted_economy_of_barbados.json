Boutique distilleries often target niche consumers who seek unique, high-quality, or artisanal products, which complements rather than competes with the mass-market approach of major distilleries. This coexistence allows diversification within the industry, catering to different consumer preferences and potentially enhancing overall economic resilience.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Both major and boutique distilleries in Barbados engage in domestic and export markets, but boutique distilleries do not exclusively focus on exports. This option oversimplifies market dynamics and ignores the overlap in market presence.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Major distilleries and boutique operations typically do not compete directly in the same market segment; boutique distilleries focus on premium or artisanal niches, whereas major distilleries target mass markets. Price wars are less common due to differentiated products.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While government subsidies may support traditional industries, there is no specific evidence that boutique distilleries exist mainly due to such subsidies, nor that major distilleries are excluded from them. Economic rationale is more strongly tied to market segmentation than subsidy allocation."
