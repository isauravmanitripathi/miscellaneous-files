                "1": "Incorrect. The pandemic’s impact was broad, affecting multiple sectors including services and manufacturing, not just agriculture. Similarly, the war’s economic impact extended beyond industrial output to include infrastructure damage and displacement, making this sector-specific division inaccurate.",
                "2": "Correct. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions in health, labor markets, and supply chains, while the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War further strained resources, displaced populations, and damaged infrastructure. Together, they created a compounded negative effect on Armenia’s GDP and investor sentiment, illustrating how overlapping crises can exacerbate economic downturns.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While increased defense spending occurred, it did not fully compensate for the economic losses caused by the pandemic. In fact, such spending can crowd out other productive investments and increase fiscal deficits, worsening economic conditions rather than offsetting them."
