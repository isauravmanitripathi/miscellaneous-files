                "0": "Correct: Improving road infrastructure directly reduces transit times and transportation costs, which enhances distribution efficiency, lowers prices, and stimulates economic growth by facilitating market access.",
                "1": "Incorrect: Higher taxes on transport vehicles would increase operational costs, potentially reducing efficiency and raising prices, which could hinder distribution and economic growth.",
                "2": "Incorrect: Subsidizing imports of foreign beverages may undermine local producers and does not directly improve the domestic distribution network or transportation efficiency.",
                "3": "Incorrect: Restricting inter-regional transport limits market integration and competition, which can reduce efficiency and economic dynamism rather than promote growth."
