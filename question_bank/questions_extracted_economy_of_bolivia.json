This liquidity constraint can discourage further investment in capital goods, slowing industrial growth and modernization. This cause-effect relationship highlights how inefficiencies in tax policy implementation can impact economic development.",

                "To compensate Jindal for operational losses due to global iron ore price fluctuations during the project period",
                "To encourage Bolivia to privatize its mining sector and reduce state control over natural resources",
                "To penalize Bolivia for mismanaging its natural resources and encourage better domestic governance",

                "0": "Incorrect. Compensation is awarded for breach of contract or unlawful actions, not for market-driven operational losses, which are inherent business risks.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The tribunal's decision does not serve as a policy tool to push privatization; rather, it addresses specific legal disputes between investor and state.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While governance issues may be relevant, the tribunal's compensation is not a penalty for mismanagement but a legal remedy for breach of contract or unlawful seizure.",
                "3": "Correct. International arbitration tribunals primarily aim to enforce investment treaties and contracts, ensuring that states do not arbitrarily seize assets or bonds of foreign investors, thereby maintaining investor confidence and legal predictability."

                "Imposing unilateral changes to investment agreements to prioritize national interests over foreign claims",

                "0": "Incorrect. While state ownership may increase control, it can deter foreign investment due to perceived risks and reduced returns, potentially leading to fewer projects and economic growth.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Blanket restrictions on foreign investment can limit capital inflows and technology transfer, harming long-term economic development.",

                "3": "Correct. Transparent contracts and respect for arbitration rulings build investor trust and reduce legal conflicts, enabling sovereign control within agreed frameworks."
