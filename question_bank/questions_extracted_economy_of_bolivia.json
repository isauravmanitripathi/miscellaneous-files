Moreover, reserve growth over 14 years is more plausibly linked to sustained trade surpluses or commodity revenues rather than a single policy action.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The statement assumes a shift from gold to reserve currencies increasing volatility risk, but typically, reserves include a mix of assets to balance risk. The data does not specify composition changes, and increased reserves generally reduce vulnerability rather than increase it.",
                "2": "Correct. A significant increase in foreign exchange reserves strengthens a country's capacity to defend its currency, manage liquidity, and cushion against external shocks such as sudden capital outflows or commodity price volatility. This is a key macroeconomic benefit of reserve accumulation.",

Bolivia's reserves growth is more likely linked to trade surpluses or commodity exports rather than increased foreign debt, and higher reserves do not necessarily imply higher fiscal deficits."
