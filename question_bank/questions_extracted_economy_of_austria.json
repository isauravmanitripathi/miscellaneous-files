                "0": "Incorrect. An increase in exports would improve the trade balance, not worsen it. Therefore, it is unlikely that increased exports caused both a doubled trade deficit and more bankruptcies.",
                "1": "Correct. A surge in bankruptcies typically indicates failing domestic firms, which reduces the country's ability to produce goods. This often leads to increased reliance on imports to meet demand, thereby widening the trade deficit. This cause-effect relationship aligns with economic principles of production capacity and trade balances.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Policies aimed at reducing imports usually improve the trade deficit, not worsen it. Moreover, such policies would not directly cause bankruptcies to surge unless poorly implemented, which is not indicated here.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While external shocks can affect both bankruptcies and trade deficits, the significant simultaneous changes suggest an interlinked causal relationship rather than independent phenomena."

                "2": "Incorrect. Monetary tightening can exacerbate unemployment and bankruptcies by increasing borrowing costs and reducing demand. Without addressing structural issues, such a policy may deepen the crisis.",
