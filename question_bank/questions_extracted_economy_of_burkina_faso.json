                "2": "Correct. Poverty and lack of educational opportunities are widely recognized as root causes driving child labour, especially in hazardous sectors like mining. Families often depend on additional income from children, and absence of accessible schooling leaves children vulnerable to exploitation.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Mechanized mining typically reduces the need for manual labour, including child labour. In Burkina Faso, mining remains largely artisanal and manual, which increases child involvement rather than reducing it."
