China's economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s and accelerated in the 1990s focused on transitioning from an agrarian economy to manufacturing and export-led growth.

While agricultural productivity improved after reforms in the 1980s, its contribution to the high GDP growth in the 2000s and 2010s was limited compared to industrial and service sectors.
