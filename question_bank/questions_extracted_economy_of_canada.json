Canada's import patterns are heavily influenced by geographic proximity (notably the US) and trade agreements like USMCA, which facilitate trade with neighboring countries more than with distant economies like France. This explains France's modest 1.1% share despite its global economic stature.",
                "1": "Incorrect. There is no substantial evidence that France imposes high export tariffs specifically targeting Canada. Tariffs are generally regulated by international agreements, and France, as part of the EU, benefits from trade frameworks that do not disproportionately disadvantage Canada.",
