                "1": "Correct. A significant GDP contraction, such as Algeria's -5.1% in 2020, generally reduces overall economic activity and demand, leading to higher unemployment as firms lay off workers. Simultaneously, reduced demand tends to lower inflationary pressures, which aligns with Algeria's moderate inflation rate of 2.4%. This reflects a demand-deficient recession scenario.",

While unemployment typically rises during GDP contractions, inflation rising sharply is more characteristic of cost-push inflation or supply shocks, not demand-driven recessions. Algeria's inflation was moderate, suggesting supply constraints were not the dominant factor.",
                "3": "Incorrect. High inflation during GDP contraction would suggest demand-pull inflation, which contradicts the usual economic dynamics during recessions where demand falls. Algeria's inflation was relatively low, indicating subdued demand rather than excess demand."
