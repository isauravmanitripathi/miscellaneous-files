While government revenue from tourism taxes is part of the economy, direct contribution is not limited to tax revenue but includes the value added by tourism services. Foreign investments affect capital formation but are not the primary reason for the difference between direct and indirect contributions.",

Indirect contribution encompasses the wider economic impact, including supply chain effects (e.g., food suppliers, construction) and induced effects (e.g., increased household spending from tourism-related income), explaining why indirect contribution is higher.",
