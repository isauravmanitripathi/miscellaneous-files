The slowdown in Chile's GDP growth in 1998 is primarily attributed to the combination of tight monetary policies aimed at controlling inflation and the adverse effects of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which reduced demand for exports and disrupted financial markets.",

Import substitution policies generally aim to reduce imports by promoting domestic production but often lead to inefficiencies and do not necessarily improve trade balance rapidly. Chile’s economic model in the 2000s was more oriented towards export-led growth rather than import substitution.",
