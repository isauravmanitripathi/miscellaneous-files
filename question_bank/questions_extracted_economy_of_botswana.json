A fixed exchange rate is not a direct consequence of removing exchange controls; thus, this option misrepresents the policy impact.",

                "3": "Correct: Abolishing foreign exchange controls typically removes barriers to currency conversion and capital flows, making it easier for foreign investors to invest and repatriate profits. This openness encourages foreign direct investment (FDI), which can stimulate private sector development through capital infusion, technology transfer, and market expansion."

This discourages new investments and can slow private sector growth by limiting access to international capital and trade.",
