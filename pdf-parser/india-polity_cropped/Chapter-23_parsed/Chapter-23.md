# **23 Parliamentary Committees**

## **MEANING**

The Parliament is too unwieldy a body to deliberate effectively the issues that come up before it. The functions of the Parliament are varied, complex and voluminous. Moreover, it has neither the adequate time nor necessary expertise to make a detailed scrutiny of all legislative measures and other matters. Therefore, it is assisted by a number of committees in the discharge of its duties.

The Constitution of India makes a mention of these committees at different places, but without making any specific provisions regarding their composition, tenure, functions, etc. All these matters are dealt by the rules of two Houses. Accordingly, a parliamentary committee means a committee that:

1. Is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker /  $Chairman<sup>1</sup>$ 

- 2. Works under the direction of the Speaker / Chairman
- 3. Presents its report to the House or to the Speaker / Chairman
- 4. Has a secretariat provided by the Lok Sabha / Rajya Sabha

The consultative committees, which also consist of members of Parliament, are not parliamentary committees as they do not fulfill above four conditions.2

# **CLASSIFICATION**

Broadly, parliamentary committees are of two kindsâ€“Standing Committees and *Ad Hoc* Committees. The former are permanent (constituted every year or periodically) and work on a continuous basis, while the latter are temporary and cease to exist on completion of the task assigned to them.

## **Standing Committees**

On the basis of the nature of functions performed by them, standing committees can be classified into the following six categories:

#### *1. Financial Committees*

- (a) Public Accounts Committee
- (b) Estimates Committee
- (c) Committee on Public Undertakings

#### *2. Departmental Standing Committees (24)*

#### *3. Committees to Inquire*

- (a) Committee on Petitions
- (b) Committee of Privileges
- (c) Ethics Committee

#### *4. Committees to Scrutinise and Control*

- (a) Committee on Government Assurances
- (b) Committee on Subordinate Legislation
- (c) Committee on Papers Laid on the Table
- (d) Committee on Welfare of SCs and STs
- (e) Committee on Empowerment of Women
- (f) Joint Committee<sup>3</sup> on Offices of Profit

#### *5. Committees Relating to the Day-to-Day Business of the House*

- (a) Business Advisory Committee
- (b) Committee on Private Members' Bills and Resolutions
- (c) Rules Committee
- (d) Committee on Absence of Members from Sittings of the House

## *6. House-Keeping Committees or Service Committees (i.e., Committees concerned with the Provision of Facilities and Services to Members):*

- (a) General Purposes Committee
- (b) House Committee
- (c) Library Committee
- (d) Joint Committee on Salaries and Allowances of Members

# **Ad Hoc Committees**

*Ad hoc* committees can be divided into two categories, that is, Inquiry Committees and Advisory Committees.

1. Inquiry Committees are constituted from time to time, either by the two Houses on a motion adopted in that behalf, or by the Speaker / Chairman, to inquire into and report on specific subjects. For example:

(a) Committee on the Conduct of Certain Members during President's **Address** 

(b) Committee on Draft Five-Year Plan

(c) Railway Convention Committee $4$ 

(d) Committee on Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)

(e) Joint Committee on Bofors Contract

(f) Joint Committee on Fertilizer Pricing

(g) Joint Committee to Enquire into Irregularities in Securities and Banking Transactions

(h) Joint Committee on Stock Market Scam

(i) Joint Committee on Security in Parliament Complex

(j) Committee on Provision of Computers to Members of Parliament, Offices of Political Parties and Officers of the Lok Sabha Secretariat

(k) Committee on Food Management in Parliament House Complex

(l) Committee on Installation of Portraits / Statues of National Leaders and Parliamentarians in Parliament House Complex

(m) Joint Committee on Maintenance of Heritage Character and Development of Parliament House Complex

(n) Committee on Violation of Protocol Norms and Contemptuous Behaviour of Government Officers with Members of Lok Sabha

(o) Joint Committee to Examine Matters Relating to Allocation and Pricing of Telecom Licences and Spectrum

2. Advisory Committees include select or joint committees on bills, which are appointed to consider and report on particular bills. These committees are distinguishable from the other *ad hoc* committees in as much as they are concerned with bills and the procedure to be followed by them is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and the Directions by the Speaker / Chairman.

When a Bill comes up before a House for general discussion, it is open to that House to refer it to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint Committee of the two Houses. A motion to this effect has to be moved and adopted in the House in which the Bill comes up for consideration. In case the motion adopted is for reference of the Bill to a Joint Committee, the decision is conveyed to the other House, requesting the members to nominate members of the other House to serve on the Committee.

The Select or Joint Committee considers the Bill clause by clause just as the two Houses do. Amendments to various clauses can be moved by members of the Committee. The Committee can also take evidence of associations, public bodies or experts who are interested in the Bill. After the Bill has thus been considered, the Committee submits its report to the House. Members who do not agree with the majority report may append their minutes of dissent to the report.

# **FINANCIAL COMMITTEES**

#### *Public Accounts Committee*

This committee was set up first in 1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919 and has since been in existence. At present, it consists of 22 members (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha). The members are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed from amongst its members by the Speaker. Until 1966 - '67, the chairman of the committee belonged to the ruling party. However, since 1967 a convention has developed whereby the chairman of the committee is selected invariably from the Opposition.

The function of the committee is to examine the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), which are laid before the Parliament by the President. The CAG submits three audit reports to the President, namely, audit report on appropriation accounts, audit report on finance accounts and audit report on public undertakings.

The committee examines public expenditure not only from legal and formal point of view to discover technical irregularities but also from the point of view of economy, prudence, wisdom and propriety to bring out the cases of waste, loss, corruption, extravagance, inefficiency and nugatory expenses.

*In more detail, the functions of the committee are:*

1. To examine the appropriation accounts and the finance accounts of the Union government and any other accounts laid before the Lok Sabha. The appropriation accounts compare the actual expenditure with the expenditure sanctioned by the Parliament through the *Appropriation Act*, while the finance accounts shows the annual receipts and disbursements of the Union Government.

2. In scrutinising the appropriation accounts and the audit report of CAG on it, the committee has to satisfy itself that

(a) The money that has been disbursed was legally available for the applied service or purpose

(b) The expenditure conforms to the authority that governs it

(c) Every re-appropriation has been made in accordance with the related rules

3. To examine the accounts of state corporations, trading concerns and manufacturing projects and the audit report of CAG on them (except those public undertakings which are allotted to the Committee on Public Undertakings)

4. To examine the accounts of autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, the audit of which is conducted by the CAG

5. To consider the report of the CAG relating to the audit of any receipt or to examine the accounts of stores and stocks

6. To examine the money spent on any service during a financial year in excess of the amount granted by the Lok Sabha for that purpose

In the fulfillment of the above functions, the committee is assisted by the CAG. In fact, the CAG acts as a guide, friend and philosopher of the committee.

On the role played by the committee, Ashok Chanda (who himself has been a CAG of India) observed: "Over a period of years, the committee has entirely fulfilled the expectation that it should develop into a powerful force in the control of public expenditure. It may be claimed that the traditions established and conventions developed by the Public Accounts Committee conform to the highest traditions of a parliamentary democracy."<sup>5</sup>

*However, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the following:*

(a) It is not concerned with the questions of policy in broader sense.

(b) It conducts a post-mortem examination of accounts (showing the expenditure already incurred).

(c) It cannot intervene in the matters of day-to-day administration.

(d) Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.

(e) It is not vested with the power of disallowance of expenditures by the departments.

(f) It is not an executive body and hence, cannot issue an order. Only the Parliament can take a final decision on its findings.

#### *Estimates Committee*

The origin of this committee can be traced to the standing financial committee set up in 1921. The first Estimates Committee in the postindependence era was constituted in 1950 on the recommendation of John Mathai, the then finance minister. Originally, it had 25 members but in 1956 its membership was raised to 30. All the thirty members are from Lok Sabha only. The Rajya Sabha has no representation in this committee. These members are elected by the Lok Sabha every year from amongst its own members, according to the principles of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation in it. The term of office is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members and he is invariably from the ruling party.

The function of the committee is to examine the estimates included in the budget and suggest 'economies' in public expenditure. Hence, it has been described as a 'continuous economy committee'.

*In more detail, the functions of the committee are:*

1. To report what economies, improvements in organisation, efficiency and administrative reform consistent with the policy underlying the estimates, can be affected

2. To suggest alternative policies in order to bring about efficiency and economy in administration

3. To examine whether the money is well laid out within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates

4. To suggest the form in which the estimates are to be presented to Parliament

The Committee shall not exercise its functions in relation to such public undertakings as are allotted to the Committee on Public Undertakings. The Committee may continue the examination of the estimates from time to time, throughout the financial year and report to the House as its examination proceeds. It shall not be incumbent on the Committee to examine the entire estimates of any one year. The demands for grants may be finally voted despite the fact that the Committee has made no report.

*However, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the following:*

(a) It examines the budget estimates only after they have been voted by the Parliament, and not before that.

(b) It cannot question the policy laid down by the Parliament.

(c) Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.

(d) It examines every year only certain selected ministries and departments. Thus, by rotation, it would cover all of them over a number of years.

(e) It lacks the expert assistance of the CAG which is available to the Public Accounts Committee.

(f) Its work is in the nature of a postmortem.

### *Committee on Public Undertakings*

This committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation of the Krishna Menon Committee. Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha and 5 from the Rajya Sabha). However, in 1974, its membership was raised to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha). The members of this committee are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its own members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members who are drawn from the Lok Sabha only. Thus, the members of the committee who are from the Rajya Sabha cannot be appointed as the chairman.

*The functions of the committee are:*

1. To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings

2. To examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on public undertakings

3. To examine (in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public undertakings) whether the affairs of the public undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices

4. To exercise such other functions vested in the public accounts committee and the estimates committee in relation to public undertakings which are allotted to it by the Speaker from time to time

*The committee is not to examine and investigate any of the following:*
- (i) Matters of major government policy as distinct from business or commercial functions of the public undertakings
- (ii) Matters of day-to-day administration
- (iii) Matters for the consideration of which machinery is established by any special statute under which a particular public undertaking is established

*Further, the effectiveness of the role of the committee is limited by the following:*

(a) It cannot take up the examination of more than ten to twelve public undertakings in a year.

(b) Its work is in the nature of a post-mortem.

(c) It does not look into technical matters as its members are not technical experts.

(d) Its recommendations are advisory and not binding on the ministries.

# **DEPARTMENTAL STANDING COMMITTEES**

On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha, 17 Departmentally-Related Standing Committees (DRSCs) were set up in the Parliament in 1993.<sup>6</sup> In 2004, seven more such committees were setup, thus increasing their number from 17 to 24.

The main objective of the standing committees is to secure more accountability of the Executive (i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the Parliament, particularly financial accountability. They also assist the Parliament in debating the budget more effectively.<sup>2</sup>

The 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the ministries / departments of the Central Government.

Each standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha). The members of the Lok Sabha are nominated by the Speaker from amongst its own members, just as the members of the Rajya Sabha are nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members. $\frac{8}{3}$ 

A minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the standing committees. In case a member, after his nomination to any of the standing committees, is appointed a minister, he then ceases to be a member of the committee.

The term of office of each standing committee is one year from the date of its constitution.

Out of the 24 standing committees, 8 work under the Rajya Sabha and 16 under the Lok Sabha.<sup>2</sup>

The 24 standing committees and the ministries / departments placed under their jurisdiction are shown below in **Table 23.1**.

*The functions of each of the standing committees are:*

1. To consider the demands for grants of the concerned ministries / departments before they are discussed and voted in the Lok Sabha. Its report should not suggest anything of the nature of cut motions

2. To examine bills pertaining to the concerned ministries / departments

3. To consider annual reports of ministries / departments

4. To consider national basic long-term policy documents presented to the Houses

*The following limitations are imposed on the functioning of these standing committees:*

(i) They should not consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the concerned ministries / departments.
