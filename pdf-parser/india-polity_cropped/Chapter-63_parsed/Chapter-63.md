# **63 National Disaster Management Authority**

#### **ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NDMA**

The Government of India, recognising the importance of disaster management as a national priority, had set up a High Powered Committee in 1999 and a National Committee in 2001 after the Gujarat earthquake, to make recommendations on the preparation of disaster management plans and suggest effective mitigation mechanisms. However, after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, the Government of India took a defining step in the legislative history of the country by enacting the Disaster Management Act,  $2005^{\frac{1}{2}}$ .

The Act provided for the creation of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to spearhead and implement a holistic and integrated approach to disaster management in the country.
