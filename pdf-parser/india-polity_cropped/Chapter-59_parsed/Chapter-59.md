# **59 Central Vigilance Commission**

#### **ESTABLISHMENT**

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is the main agency for preventing corruption in the Central government. It was established in 1964 by an executive resolution of the Central government. Its establishment was recommended by the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption<sup>1</sup>  $(1962–64)$ .

Thus, originally the CVC was neither a constitutional body nor a statutory body. Later, in 2003, the Parliament enacted a law conferring statutory status on the  $\text{CVC}^2$ .

In 2004, the CVC has been designated as the agency to receive and act on complaints or disclosure on any allegation of corruption or misuse of office from whistle blowers under the "Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Informers' Resolution" (PIDPI), which is popularly known as "Whistle Blowers" Resolution. The Commission is also empowered as the only designated agency to take action against complainants making motivated or vexatious complaints.<sup>2a</sup>

The CVC is conceived to be the apex vigilance institution, free of control from any executive authority, monitoring all vigilance activity under the Central Government and advising various authorities in Central Government organisations in planning, executing, reviewing and reforming their vigilance work.

### **COMPOSITION**

The CVC is a multi-member body consisting of a Central Vigilance Commissioner (chairperson) and not more than two vigilance commissioners. They are appointed by the president by warrant under his hand and seal on the recommendation of a three-member committee consisting of the prime minister as its head, the Union minister of home affairs and the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha. They hold office for a term of four years or until they attain the age of sixty five years, whichever is earlier. After their tenure, they are not eligible for further employment under the Central or a state government.

The president can remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner from the office under the following circumstances:

(a) If he is adjudged an insolvent; or

(b) If he has been convicted of an offence which (in the opinion of the Central government) involves a moral turpitude; or

(c) If he engages, during his term of office, in any paid employment outside the duties of his office; or

(d) If he is (in the opinion of the president), unfit to continue in office by reason of infirmity of mind or body; or

(e) If he has acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his official functions.

In addition to these, the president can also remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or any vigilance commissioner on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. However, in these cases, the president has to refer the matter to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the cause of removal and advises so, then the president can remove him. He is deemed to be guilty of misbehaviour, if he (a) is concerned or interested in any contract or agreement made by the Central government, or (b) participates in any way in the profit of such contract or agreement or in any benefit or emolument arising therefrom otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company.

The salary, allowances and other conditions of service of the Central Vigilance Commissioner are similar to those of the Chairman of UPSC and that of the vigilance commissioner are similar to those of a member of UPSC. But they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.

# **WHISTLE BLOWERS PROTECTION ACT (2014)**

The salient features of the Whistle Blowers Protection Act  $(2014)^6$  are as follows<sup> $\frac{1}{2}$ </sup>:

1. The Act provides a mechanism for protecting the identity of whistle blowers (a term given to people who expose corruption). People who expose corruption in Government or irregularities by public functionaries can now be free of any fear of victimization.

2. The Act also provides for a system to encourage people to disclose information about corruption or the wilful misuse of power by public servants, including ministers.

3. As per the Act, a person can make a public interest disclosure on corruption before a competent authority - which is at present the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The government, by notification, can appoint any other body also for receiving such complaints about corruption.

4. The Act, however, lays down punishment of up to two years in prison and a fine of up to ₹30,000 for false or frivolous complaints.

5. The Act says that every disclosure shall be made in good faith and the person making the disclosure shall provide a personal declaration stating that he reasonably believes that the information disclosed by him and the allegation contained therein is substantially true.

6. Disclosures can be made in writing or by email message in accordance with the procedure as may be prescribed and contain full particulars and be accompanied by supporting documents, or other material.

7. However, no action shall be taken on a disclosure if it does not indicate the identity of the complainant or public servant or if "the identity of the complainant or public servant is found to be incorrect."

8. The Act is not applicable to the Special Protection Group.
