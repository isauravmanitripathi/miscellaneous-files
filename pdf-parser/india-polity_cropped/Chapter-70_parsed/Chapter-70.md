# **70 Role of Regional Parties**

The presence of a large number of regional parties is an important feature of the Indian Political System. They have come to play a vital role in Indian politics at all levels, i.e. local, state and national. This is more so in the context of the new era of coalition politics.

### **FEATURES OF REGIONAL PARTIES**

Following are the features of a regional party:

1. It generally operates within a particular state or specific region. Its electoral base is limited to a single region.

2. It articulates regional interests and identifies itself with a particular cultural, religious, linguistic or ethnic group.

3. It is primarily concerned with exploiting the local resources of discontent or preserving a variety of primordial demands based on language, caste or community or region $<sup>1</sup>$ .</sup>

4. It focuses on local or regional issues and aims to capture political power at the state level. It has no inclination to expand and control the central government.

5. It has a political desire for greater regional autonomy of states in the Indian Union<sup>2</sup>.

#### **CLASSIFICATION OF REGIONAL PARTIES**

The various regional parties in India can be classified into the following four categories:

1. Those regional parties which are based on the regional culture or ethnicity. These include Shiromani Akali Dal, National Conference, DMK, AIADMK, Telugu Desam, Shiv Sena, Asom Gana Parishad, Mizo National Front, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and so on.

2. Those regional parties which have an all-India outlook but lack a national electoral base. The examples are Indian National Lok Dal, All-India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party, Samajwadi Party, Nationalist Congress Party and so on.

3. Those regional parties which have been formed by a split in national parties. For example, Bangla Congress, Bharatiya Kranti Dal, Utkal Congress, Kerala Congress, Telangana Praja Samithi, Biju Janata Dal, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Party, Samajwadi Janata Party, Samata Party, Trinamool Congress, YSR Congress and so on.

4. Those regional parties which have been formed by individual leaders on the basis of their charismatic personality. These are called as personalised parties and they are short-lived. The examples are Lok Janshakti Party, Haryana Vikas Party, Himachal Vikas Congress, Congress (J) and so on.

- 6. Reorganisation of states on the basis of language.
- 7. Charismatic personality of the regional leaders.

1. They have provided better governance and a stable government at the regional level.

2. They have posed a challenge to the one-party dominant system in the country and led to a decline in the domination of the Congress party<sup>3</sup>.

3. They have made a strong impact on the nature and course of centrestate relations. The tension areas in centre-state relations and the demand for grant of greater autonomy made the central leadership more responsive to the needs of the regional actors $4$ .

4. They have made politics more competitive and popular participation in the political process more extensive at the grass roots $\frac{5}{5}$ .

10. After the dawn of the era of coalition politics, the regional parties have assumed an important role in national politics. The have joined the coalition governments formed at the centre and shared power with the national parties $9$ .

## **DYSFUNCTIONS OF REGIONAL PARTIES**

However, there are also negative points in the role of regional parties. These are as follows:

1. They have given more importance to regional interests rather than national interests. They have neglected the implications and consequences of their narrow approach to the resolution of national issues.

2. They have encouraged regionalism, cas-teism, linguism, communalism and tribalism which have become hurdles to national integration.

3. They are responsible for the unresolution of the inter-state water disputes, inter-state border disputes and other inter-state issues.

4. They have also indulged in corruption, nepotism, favouritism and other forms of misutilisation of power in order to promote their selfinterest.

5. They have focused more on the populist schemes and measures to expand and strengthen their electoral base. This has adversely affected the state economy and development.

6. They bring in regional factor in the decision-making and the policymaking by the coalition government at the centre. They force the central leadership to yield to their demands $\frac{10}{2}$ .
