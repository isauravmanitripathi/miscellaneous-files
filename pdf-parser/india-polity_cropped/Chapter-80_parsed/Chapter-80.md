# **80 National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution**

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) was set up by a resolution of the Government of India in  $2000^{\text{L}}$ . The 11-member Commission was headed by M.N. Venkatachaliah, the former Chief Justice of India<sup>2</sup>. It submitted its report in 2002<sup>3</sup>.

### **I. TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMISSION**

According to the terms of reference, the commission was required to examine, in the light of the experience of the past fifty years, as to how far the existing provisions of the Constitution are capable of responding to the needs of efficient, smooth and effective system of governance and socioeconomic development of modern India and to recommend changes, if any. The terms of reference clearly specified that the commission should recommend changes that are required to be made in the Constitution within the framework of parliamentary democracy and without interfering with the 'basic structure' or 'basic features' of the Constitution.

The commission clarified that its task was to review the working of the Constitution and not to rewrite it and its function was only recommendatory and advisory in nature. It was left to the Parliament to accept or reject any of the recommendations.

The commission had no agenda before it. On its own, it identified the eleven areas of study and proposed to examine them. They included the following<sup>4</sup>:

1. Strengthening of the institutions of parliamentary democracy (working of the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary; their accountability; problems of administrative, social and economic cost of political instability; exploring the possibilities of stability within the discipline of parliamentary democracy).

2. Electoral reforms; standards in political life.

3. Pace of socio-economic change and development under the Constitution (assurance of social and economic rights: how fair? how fast? how equal?).

4. Promoting literacy; generating employment; ensuring social security; alleviation of poverty.

5. Union-State relations.

6. Decentralization and devolution; empowerment and strengthening of Panchayati Raj Institutions.

7. Enlargement of Fundamental Rights.

8. Effectuation of Fundamental Duties.

9. Effectuation of Directive Principles and achievement of the Preambular objectives of the Constitution.

10. Legal control of fiscal and monetary policies; public audit mechanism.

11. Administrative system and standards in public life.

# **II. FIFTY YEARS OF WORKING OF THE CONSTITUTION**

The observations made by the Commission on the working of the Constitution from 1950 to 2000 are as follows $\frac{1}{5}$ :

What are our achievements and failures over the 50 years since Independence? How have each of the three organs of the State–the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary– redeemed the constitutional pledge of ushering in a social revolution? Has the dream of the founding fathers for a life of dignity to the vast millions through the process of socioeconomic transformation been realized ? What then is the Balance Sheet?

#### **1. Political Accomplishments**

1. India's democratic base has stabilized as a working federal polity. With the  $73<sup>rd</sup>$  and  $74<sup>th</sup>$  Constitutional amendments, the base of democratic debate has widened. There is greater push towards noncentralisation. General Elections have been held with regularity; and transfers of power consequent upon the results of elections have been orderly, peaceful and democratic.

2. The educational qualifications of the Members of Parliament and State Legislatures have shown marked improvements. The Parliament and State Legislatures are increasingly more representative of the composition of society. More and more members of the hitherto backward classes are moving up in the political ladder.

#### **2. Economic Infrastructure–Impressive Performance**

1. There has been marked expansion and diversification of production. New technologies and modern management techniques are increasingly employed. There are marked advances in Science, Technology, Medicine, Engineering and Information Technology.

2. Between 1950–2000, the index of agricultural production increased from 46.2 to 176.8.

3. Between 1960–2000, wheat production went up from 11 million tonnes to 75.6 million tonnes.

4. Between 1960–2000, rice production went up from 35 million tonnes to 89.5 million tonnes.

5. Impressive expansion of industrial and service sectors has taken place.

6. Index of industrial production went up from 7.9 in 1950–51 to 154.7 in 1999–2000.

7. Electricity generation has increased from 5.1 billion KWH in 1950– 51 to 480.7 billion KWH in 1999–2000.

8. 6 to 8 per cent annual growth of GNP between 1994–2000 (except in 1997–98) was achieved.

9. Revenues from Information Technology industry have grown from \$ 150 million in 1990 to \$ 4 billion in 1999.

10. India's per capita Net National Product (NNP) in 1999–2000 was more than 2.75 times than what it was in 1951.

# **3. Social Infrastructure– Achievements**

1. Between 1950 to 1998, infant mortality rate have halved to 72 births per 1000 births–down from 146.

2. Life expectancy at birth has grown up from 32 years in 1950–51 to 63 years in 2000.

3. A child born in Kerala today can expect to live longer than a child born in Washington.

4. Life expectancy of women in Kerala is now 75 years.

5. India has put in place an extensive system of Public Health Services and medical network. In 1951, the country had only 725 primary health centers. By 1995, this has increased to more than 1,50,000.

6. The number of primary schools has increased significantly between 1951 and 1995 from 2,10,000 to 5,90,000.

7. Nearly 95 per cent of the villages have a primary school within a walking distance of one kilometer.

## **4. Political Failures**

1. The main cause and source of politicaldecay is the ineptness of the electoral process which has not been able to keep out criminal, antisocial and undesirable elements from participating in and even

dominating the political scene and polluting the electoral and parliamentary processes.

2. Though democratic traditions are stabilizing, however, democracy cannot be said to be an inclusive representative democracy. The pluralism and diversity of India is not reflected in and captured by its democratic institutions; likewise, participation of women in public affairs and decision-making processes is nowhere near proportionate to their numbers.

3. The enormity of the costs of elections and electoral corruption have been having a grievous deleterious effect on national progress and has led to the degradation of political processes to detriment of common good.

4. Political parties, which have a fair share of the criminal elements, handle enormous funds collected ostensibly for meeting party and electoral expenditure. Money-power and criminal elements have contributed to pervasive degeneration of standards in public life and have criminalized politics. This is reflected in the quality of governments and of the governing processes.

5. There are no legal instrumentalities or set of law regulating the conduct of the political parties, legitimacy of fundraising, audit and account requirements and inner-party democracy.

6. National political parties are more divided on the definition of 'common national purpose' than ever before; the noble purposes of public life have degenerated than ever before into opportunistic and self-seeking politics of competitive personal gain.

7. 'Fraternity', the noble ideal of brotherhood of man, enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution has remained unrealized. The people of India are more divided amongst themselves than at the time of the country's independence.

8. There is increasing criminalization and exploitation of the political climate and processes and an increasing criminals-politiciansbureaucratic nexus.

9. There is crisis of confidence. There is crisis of leadership. Political leaders, owing to narrow partisan and sectarian interests and desire for short-time political gains, are unable even to agree upon broad common national purposes.

# **5. Economic Failures**

1. The richest top quintile of population has 85 per cent of the income. The poorest quintile has only 1.5 per cent of the country's income. The second, the third and the fourth quintile from top have respectively 8 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the income.

2. 260 million people live below the poverty line.

#### **6. Social Failures**

1. India's maternal mortality rate in 1998 was 407 per 100,000 live births. These levels are more than 100 times the levels found in the West.

2. Some 53 per cent children (almost 60 million) under five remain malnour-ished–nearly twice the levels reported in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

3. The proportion of low birth weight babies born in India is 33 per cent. It is only 9 per cent in China and South Korea, 6 per cent in Thailand and 8 per cent in Indonesia.

4. India was a signatory to the Alma Ata Declaration in 1978 that assured 'health for all' by the year 2000. Only 42 per cent of the children between 12–23 months are fully immunized - 37 per cent in rural areas and 61 per cent in urban areas. The coverage is shockingly low in Bihar - 11 per cent and in Rajasthan - 17 per cent.

5. While per capita daily consumption of cereals has improved only marginally from 400 gms in 1950 to about 440 gms in 2000, the per capita pulses (protein intake) have over the 50 years decreased.

6. The promise of social revolution has remained unredeemed. There are 270 million Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the measures for their welfare and uplift have not been implemented with sincerity.

7. There are 380 million children below the age of 14. Almost 100 million of them are Dalit children. No effective steps are taken to bring them to the level of the "core-mainstream".

8. Population control measures in the northern States have not succeeded. Fertility rates in Uttar Pradesh indicate that the State is almost a century behind Kerala.

# **7. Administrative Failures**

1. Corruption, insensitivity and inefficiency of administration have resulted in extralegal systems and parallel economies and even parallel governments. Bureaucratic corruption, which cause frustration in people in their daily lives, has pushed more and more people into extralegal systems. The mal-administration has resulted in a lack of faith in and disenchantment with institutions of democracy.

2. There is an increasing non-accountability. Corruption has been pervasive. Public interest has suffered.

3. Constitutional protection for the Services under Article 311 has largely been exploited by dishonest officials to protect themselves from the consequences of their wrong-doings.

# **8. Gender Justice and Equality– Failures**

1. The regional disparities in life expectancy is indicated by the fact that a woman born in Kerala can expect to live 18 years longer than one born in Madhya Pradesh.

2. In most countries life expectancy among women exceeds that of men by about 5 years. In all but a few countries of the world, there are typically 1005 women for every 1000 men. Men outnumber women only in societies where women are specifically and systematically discriminated. In India, there are only 933 women for every 1000 men. This is the phenomenon about 'missing' women.

3. Overall representation of women in public services is just 4.9 per cent.

4. Political participation of women indicates that in 1952 there were only 22 women in Lok Sabha against 499 seats (4.41 per cent). In 1991, this increased to 49 seats as against 544 seats (9.02 per cent).

5. Between 1995–2000, out of 503 judges of the High Court, only 15 were women.

## **9. Judicial System–Failures**

1. Judicial system has not been able to meet even the modest expectations of the society. Its delays and costs are frustrating, its processes slow and uncertain.

2. People are pushed to seek recourse to extra-legal methods for relief.
3. Trial system both on the civil and criminal side has utterly broken down.

On an overall assessment, there are more failures than success stories, making the inference inescapable that the fifty years of the working of the Constitution is substantially a saga of missed opportunities.

# **III. AREAS OF CONCERN: COMMISSION'S PERCEPTION**

The following are the important areas of concern according to the perception of the Commission<sup>6</sup>:

1. There is a fundamental breach of the constitutional faith on the part of Governments and their method of governance lies in the neglect of the people who are the ultimate source of all political authority. Public servants and institutions are not alive to the basic imperative that they are servants of the people meant to serve them. The dignity of the individual enshrined in the Constitution has remained an unredeemed pledge. There is, thus, a loss of faith in the Governments and governance. Citizens see their Governments besieged by uncontrollable events and are losing faith in institutions. Society is unable to cope up with current events.

2. The foremost area of concern is the present nature of the Indian State and its inability to anticipate and provide for the great global forces of change ushered in by the pace of scientific and technological developments.

3. The next and equally important dimension is the increasing cost of government and fiscal deficits which are alarming. In 1947, there was a deficit of ₹2 crores in the revenue budget; in 1997–98, it became ₹88,937 crores; in 2001–02, it is about ₹1,16,000 crores (4.8 per cent of GDP). India is on its way to a debt-trap.

4. There is pervasive impurity of the political climate and of political activity. Criminalisation of politics, politicalcorruption and the politician-criminal-bureaucratic nexus have reached unprecedented levels needing strong systemic changes.

5. Issues of national integrity and security have not received adequate and thoughtful attention. Mechanisms for the assessment of early warning symptoms of social unrest are absent. Mechanisms for adequate and immediate state responses to emergencies and disaster management are wholly inadequate. Administration, as a system for anticipating coming events and planning responses in advance, has failed. It has become un-coordinated and directionless amalgam of different departments often with over-lapping and even mutually conflicting jurisdictions, powers and responsibilities which merely acts as a reaction to problems. There are no clear-cut standards or basis for fixing responsibilities.

6. Though India's overall record and experience as a working democracy (despite many centrifugal forces) are worthy to mention and though the bases of democratic debate have widened with the  $73<sup>nd</sup>$ and  $74<sup>th</sup>$  Constitutional amendments, the working of the institutions of parliamentary democracy, however, have thrown-up serious fault-lines, which might, if unattended, prove destructive of the basic democratic values.

7. There is pervasive misuse of the electoral process and the electoral system is unable to prevent the entry of persons with criminal record into the portal of law-making institutions.

8. The Parliament and the State Legislatures, owing to the inherent weakness of the electoral system, have failed to acquire adequate representative character. The  $13<sup>th</sup>$  Lok Sabha represents only 27.9 per cent of the total electorate and the Legislature of U.P. represents only 22.2 per cent of electorate respectively.

9. The increasing instability of the elected governments is attributable to opportunistic politics and unprincipled defections. The economic and administrative costs of political instability are unaf-fordably high and their impact on the polity is not clearly comprehended and realized. Though just four Prime Ministers ruled the country for 40 years out of the 54 years of independence and one political party alone was in power for 45 years, however, 1989 onwards the country saw five General Elections to the Lok Sabha. Costs of this political instability are simply colossal.

10. The state of the Indian economy is disturbing. The economy is gradually sinking into a debt-trap. Economic, fiscal and monetary policies, coupled with administrative inefficiency, corruption and wasteful expenditure are increasingly pushing the society into extralegal systems, crime-syndicates, mob-rule and hoodlum out-fits. Black-money, parallel economy and even parallel governments are the overarching economic and social realities. Legitimate governments will, in due course, find it increasingly difficult to confront them. In course of time these illegal criminal out-fits will dictate terms to the legitimate governments.

11. Rural de-population, urbanization, urban-congestion and social unrest need immediate attention and solutions. Increasing unemployment will prove a serious threat to orderly government.

12. Future of society is increasingly knowledge-based and knowledgedriven. The quality of education and the higher research need urgent repair. The country is engaged in a unilateral and unthinking educational disarmament.

13. System of administration of justice in the country is another area of concern.

14. Criminal justice system is on the verge of collapse. The quality of investigations and prosecutions requires a strong second look. Law's delay and costs of litigation have become proverbial. Victimology, victim-protection and protection of witnesses in sensitive criminaltrials need institutional arrangements. Recruitment, training, refresher and continuing legal education for lawyers, judges and judicial administrators need immediate attention. The increasing utilization of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration as well as mechanisms of auxiliary adjudicative services need to be stressed.

15. Communal and other inter-group riots in a country like India with its religious, social and cultural diversity cannot be treated as merely law and order problem. They are manifestations of collective behavioural disorders. Legal and administrative measures are required to be taken to remove the insecurity felt by the minorities and for bringing them into the mainstream of the national fabric.

16. The state of social infrastructure is disturbing. There are 380 million children below the age of 14. The arrangements for their education, health and well-being are wholly inadequate both qualitatively and quantitatively. 96.4 per cent of the primary education budget goes for salaries alone.

17. Rates of infant mortality, blindness, maternal mortality, maternalanemia, child malnutrition and child-immunization, despite significant progress achieved, yet remain at high and disconcerting levels.

18. Public health and hygiene have not received adequate attention. There is alarming increase of infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, Hepatitis, HIV etc.

#### **IV. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION**

# **11. On Institutions in North East India**

1. Efforts are to be made to give all the States in this region the opportunities provided under the  $73<sup>rd</sup>$  and  $74<sup>th</sup>$  Constitutional Amendments. However, this should be done with due regard to the unique political traditions of the region.

2. The subjects given under the Sixth Schedule and those mentioned in the Eleventh Schedule could be entrusted to the Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).

3. Traditional forms of governance should be associated with selfgovernance because of the present dissatisfaction.

4. A National Immigration Council should be set up to examine a range of issues including review of the Citizenship Act, the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunal Act, the Foreigners Act and so on. 5. As regards Nagaland, the Naga Councils should be replaced by elected representatives of various Naga society groups with an intermediary tier at the district level.

6. As regards Assam, the Sixth Schedule should be extended to the Bodoland Autonomous Council and other Autonomous Councils be upgraded to Autonomous Development Councils.

7. As regards Meghalaya, a tier of village governance should be created for a village or a group of villages in the Autonomous District Councils.

8. As regards Tripura, the changes which may be made in respect of other Autonomous Councils should also apply in respect of the Autonomous District Councils.

9. As regards Mizoram, an intermediary elected tier should be developed at the district level in areas not covered by the Sixth Schedule.

10. As regards Manipur, the provisions of the Sixth Schedule should be extended to hill districts of the State.

## **12. On Electoral Processes**

1. Any person charged with any offence punishable with imprisonment for a maximum term of five years or more, should be disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of Parliament or Legislature of a State.

2. Any person convicted for any heinous crime like murder, rape, smuggling, dacoity, etc., should be permanently debarred from contesting for any political office.

3. Criminal cases against politicians pending before Courts either for trial or in appeal must be disposed of speedily, if necessary, by appointing Special Courts.

4. The election petitions should also be decided by special courts. In the alternative, special election benches may be constituted in the High Courts and earmarked exclusively for the disposal of election petitions and election disputes.

5. Any system of State funding of elections bears a close nexus to the regulation of working of political parties by law and to the creation of a foolproof mechanism under law with a view to implementing the financial limits strictly. Therefore, proposals for State funding should be deferred till these regulatory mechanisms are firmly in position.

6. Candidates should not be allowed to contest election simultaneously for the same office from more than one constituency.

7. The election code of conduct should be given the sanctity of law and its violation should attract penal action.

8. The Commission while recognizing the beneficial potential of the system of run off contest electing the representative winning on the basis of 50 per cent plus one vote polled, as against the present firstpast-the-post system, for a more representative democracy, recommends that the Government and the Election Commission of India should examine this issue of prescribing a minimum of 50 per cent plus one vote for election in all its aspects.

9. An independent candidate who loses election three times consecutively should be permanently debarred from contesting election to the same office.

10. The minimum number of valid votes polled should be increased to 25 per cent from the current 16.67 per cent as a condition for the deposit not being forfeited.

11. The issue of eligibility of non-Indian born citizens or those whose parents or grandparents were citizens of India to hold high offices in the realm such as President, Vice-President, Prime Minister and Chief Justice of India should be examined in depth through a political process after a national dialogue<sup>10</sup>.

12. The Chief Election Commissioner and the other Election Commissioners should be appointed on the recommendation of a body consisting of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Similar procedure should be adopted in the case of appointment of State Election Commissioners.

# **13. On Political Parties**

1. A comprehensive law regulating the registration and functioning of political parties or alliances of parties should be made. The proposed law should-

(a) provide that political party or alliance should keep its doors open to all citizens irrespective of any distinctions of caste, community or the like.

(b) make it compulsory for the parties to maintain accounts of the receipt of funds and expenditure in a systematic and regular way.

(c) make it compulsory for the political parties requiring their candidates to declare their assets and liabilities at the time of filing their nomination.

(d) provide that no political party should provide ticket to a candidate if he was convicted by any court for any criminal offence or if the courts have framed criminal charges against him.

(e) specifically provide that if any party violates the above provision , the candidate involved should be liable to be disqualified and the party deregistered and derecognized.

2. The Election Commission should progressively increase the threshold criterion for eligibility for recognition so that the proliferation of smaller political parties is discouraged.

3. A comprehensive legislation providing for regulation of contributions to the political parties and towards election expenses should be enacted by consolidating such laws. This new law should:

(a) aim at bringing transparency into political funding;

(b) permit corporate donations within higher prescribed limits;

(c) make donations up to a specified limit tax exempt;

(d) make both donors and donees of political funds accountable;

(e) provide that audited political party accounts should be published yearly; and

(f) provide for de-recognition of the party and enforcement of penalties for filing false election returns.

# **14. On Anti-Defection Law**

The provisions of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution should be amended to provide the following:

1. All persons defecting (whether individually or in groups) from the party or the alliance of parties, on whose ticket they had been elected, must resign from their parliamentary or assembly seats and must contest fresh elections.

2. The defectors should be debarred to hold any public office of a minister or any other remunerative political post for at least the duration of the remaining term of the existing legislature or until the next elections whichever is earlier.

3. The vote cast by a defector to topple a government should be treated as invalid.
4. The power to decide questions regarding disqualification on ground of defection should vest in the Election Commission instead of in the Speaker / Chairman of the House concerned.

## **V. EARLIER EFFORTS TO REVIEW THE CONSTITUTION**

Even before the appointment of this Commission in 2000, certain attempts were already made to review the working of the Constitution. The Commission itself has summarized those attempts in the following  $\frac{11}{\text{way}}$ :

1. There was nothing entirely new in the effort at reviewing the working of our Constitution. The debate had continued right from the first decade of the life of the Constitution. Also, every amendment had been an occasion for review. But, in the half-a-century and more since the Constitution came into force, whereas as many as eighty-five amendments have been instituted, there has been (till the setting up of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution) no comprehensive and transparent official exercise to review the working of the Constitution in its entirety with a view to evaluating its achievements and failures in fulfilling the objectives of the Constitution in the context of experience gained, and for future requirements perceived.

2. After the Constitution came into force, within two years, it was required to be amended. In the course of his speech on the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill, 1951, on 2 June 1951 Nehru once again repeated his views as to the need for the Constitution to be amenable to amendment. On this occasion, his words were trenchant and unsparing. He said:

"A Constitution which is unchanging and static, it does not matter how good it is, but as a Constitution it is past its use. It is in its old age already and gradually approaching its death. A Constitution to be living must be growing; must be adaptable; must be flexible; must be changeable... Therefore, it is a desirable and a good thing for people to realize that this very fine Constitution that we have fashioned after years of labour, is good in so far as it goes, but as society changes as conditions change, we amend it in the proper way".

3. Four years later, as an experienced Prime Minister with prolonged firsthand knowledge of the efficacy of the fundamental law of the land, he held the same view. Speaking on the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1955 Nehru said:

"After all, the Constitution is meant to facilitate the working of the Government and the administrative and other structures of this country. It is meant to be not something that is static and which has a static form in a changing world, but something which has something dynamic in it, which takes cognizance of the dynamic nature of modern conditions, modern society."

4. In the years that followed the Fourth Amendment, the Constitution has been amended 81 times. The Union and the State Governments and Parliament faced the Supreme Court over fundamental rights issues: freedom of expression visa-vis national integrity; personal liberty visa-vis political stability; special treatment for some segments of society visa-vis abstract equality for all; property rights vis-a-vis social revolution needs etc. Questions also arose whether the power of constitutional amendment was complete, unrestrained and unlimited and whether there were limits to the power of judicial review of constitutional amendments.

5. In the period 1950 to 1967, Parliament and most State Assemblies had preponderant Congress majorities. General Elections in 1967 were followed by the formation of non-Congress coalitions in a number of States in the northern region of the country. Certain issues pertaining to Union-State relations arose during this period directly from the functioning of mechanisms and processes under the Constitution. An Administrative Reforms Commission was constituted by the Government of India to examine administrative aspects of Union-State relations.

6. In the period following the fourth General Election, the phenomenon of unprincipled defections for money or ministerships etc. came to the fore: legislators changing their party allegiance again and again in utter disregard of all moral and political proprieties, constituency choice and public opinion. Wide-spread concern about the problem was mirrored in Parliament, and led to a unanimous resolution in the Lok Sabha on 8 December 1967. The resolution read:

"This House is of opinion that a high-level Committee consisting of representatives of political parties and constitutional experts be set up immediately by Government to consider the problem of legislators changing their allegiance from one party to another and their frequent crossing of the floor in all its aspects, and make recommendations in this regard."

7. Known subsequently as the Y.B. Chavan Committee, after the then Union Home Minister who was the Chairman of the Committee, this body produced a valuable report which addressed a variety of issues germane to the handling of the problem of defections which had basic implications with reference to the working of constitutional machinery and connected statutory and procedural instrumentalities.

8. The  $25<sup>th</sup>$  anniversary of the coming into force of the Constitution of the world's largest democratic republic occurred, ironically, in the year in which the Emergency was clamped on the nation in an atmosphere of burgeoning national unrest. It was in this context that the first concerted initiative towards a review and revision of the Constitution was undertaken in 1975. At the AICC Session in December, 1975 - the 'Kamagata Maru Session' -a resolution on the political situation stated:

"If the misery of the poor and vulnerable sections of our society is to be alleviated, vast and far-reaching changes have to be effected in our socio-economic structure... The Congress urges that our Constitution be thoroughly examined in order to ascertain if the time has not come to make adequate alterations to it so that it may continue as a living document."

9. A document titled 'A Fresh Look at Our Constitution - Some Suggestions' surfaced at this time and was circulated but, after the recommendations contained in it had drawn stringent criticism from diverse quarters, it was not pursued. Amidst tenacious advocacy about the need for constitutional change, particularly after the Kamagata Maru Session of the Indian National Congress, the then Congress President, D.K. Borooah appointed, on 26 February 1976, a Committee "to study the question of amendment of the Constitution.. in the light of experience." The twelve-member Committee, headed by Sardar Swaran Singh, submitted "tentative proposals" to the Congress President in April 1976 and these were then circulated among a select few. The then Chairman of the Law Commission of India, Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar wrote to the Prime Minister that while amendment to the Constitution was necessary to expedite the socio-economic revolution, "ad-hocism is undesirable and adoption of extremist doctrinaire positions is irrelevant and inadvisable". He advised the Prime Minister "to appoint a high powered committee to research and discuss the problem in depth for a dedicated and comprehensive effort."

10. The Swaran Singh Committee Report stated that its recommendations had been made with the background of the tentative proposals circulated earlier to Congress Chief Ministers and Pradesh Congress Committees, the views of Bar Associations of the Supreme Court and all the High Courts, comments in the Press and in public and memoranda and opinions received from individuals, professional bodies etc. It said:

".....the Committee has kept before it certain important objectives. Our Constitution has functioned without any serious impediment during the past 26 years or so. While this is so, difficulties have been thrown up from time to time in the interpretation of some of its provisions, more particularly when they concern the right of Parliament to be the most authentic and effective instrument to give expression and content to the sovereign will of the people".

The Committee also declared that:

"The Parliamentary system is best suited to our country, and it is unnecessary to abandon it in favour of the Presidential or any other system. In a vast country like India, with the kind of regional diversity as we have, the Parliamentary system preserves best the unity and integrity of the country and ensures greater responsiveness to the voice of the people."

11. The Committee made a series of recommendations on a wide range of issues including the Preamble; the Directive Principles; the constituent power of Parliament to amend the Constitution; the power of judicial review; article 276; service matters; industrial and labour disputes; matters relating to revenue, land reform, procurement and distribution of food grains and other essential commodities; Election matters; Article 227; disqualification for membership of a house of Parliament or either house of the State Legislature; article 352 and Union State Coordination. The Committee also undertook to make separate proposals for the deletion of some provisions of the Constitution which, it observed, had become "obsolete or redundant."

12. Reacting to the Swaran Singh Committee and its report as published, Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar, then still the Chairman of the Law Commission, in a letter to Smt. Indira Gandhi, reiterated his view that the amendment to the fundamental law of the land should not have been left to a party committee and that the modality could, advisedly, have been a committee of experts to hear all parties and persons. He said, further, that the Committee appointed by Congress President Borooah had "worked in a hurry, discussed issues in a casual manner and based its recommendations mainly on political considerations."

13. When the Forty-Second Amendment Bill was prepared, the Statement of Objects and Reasons echoed some of Jawaharlal Nehru's words. "A Constitution to be living must be growing", it declared. "If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the Constitution will suffer virtual atrophy." The Prime Minister, in her speech in the Lok Sabha on 27 October 1976, said that the purpose of the Bill was "to remedy the anomalies that have long been noticed and to overcome obstacles put up by economic and political vested interests," and that the Bill was "responsive to the aspirations of the people, and reflects the realities of the present time and the future".

14. After the change of Government, following general elections in 1977, the then Prime Minister, Morarji Desai appointed a Committee of Members of Parliament as a forum for considering substantive changes in the amendments brought about during the Emergency. Subsequently, the Prime Minister set up a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet for the same purpose. Issues germane to the  $42<sup>nd</sup>$  Amendment were subject matter of voluminous expression of opinion by jurists, parliamentarians, editors and professional bodies. But, essentially, the effort focused on the correction of the imbalance in the Constitution caused by some provisions of the Forty Second Amendment.

15. The need was felt for a comprehensive review of Union-State relations following the experience gained in the period after the General Elections of 1977 which had resulted in non Congress governments at the Centre and in several major States in the north, but governments formed by the Congress in the southern States. In 1983, a Commission was constituted under the chairmanship of Justice R.S. Sarkaria with fairly wide-ranging terms of reference. These included:

"(i) The Commission will examine and review the working of the existing arrangements between the Union and the States in regard to powers, functions and responsibilities in all spheres and recommend such changes or other measures as may be appropriate;

(ii) In examining and reviewing the working of existing arrangements between the Union and States and making recommendations as to changes and measures needed, the Commission will keep in view the social and economic developments that have taken place over the years and have due regard to the scheme and framework of the Constitution which the founding fathers have so sedulously designed to protect the independence and ensure the unity and integrity of the country which is of paramount importance for promoting the welfare of the people."

16. There were also some other especially note-worthy studies of particular problems in the political system. Deep concern had been voiced relative to flaws in the electoral process. This had occasioned a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Amendments to Election Law, which submitted its report in 1972. The Committee for Democracy set up by Loknayak Jaya Prakash Narayan had also studied the subject. Various aspects of electoral reforms were reviewed by a Cabinet Sub Committee appointed in 1977 and another in 1982. In 1990, the Government of India constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of the then Union Law Minister Dinesh Goswami with Members drawn from different political parties. The Report of the Committee contained a series of recommendations, most of which were accepted for implementation.

17. A Committee to examine issues related to State Funding of Elections was constituted in May 1998, known as the Indrajit Gupta Committee after that outstanding Parliamentarian and leader who was its Chairman. Although the Committee had a relatively limited compass of study, its observations are noteworthy and comprise valuable supplementary material pertaining to the process of elections.

18. Various Reports of the Law Commission of India provide a wealth of insights into the working of the machinery of the Constitution. The 170th Report of the Law Commission, on Reform of Election Laws, presented in May 1999, considers radical approaches seeking to improve the system of elections - the very sheet anchor of Parliamentary Democracy under the Constitution.

19. The most significant of the non-political civil society efforts was the seminar organised by 15 national institutions in 1992 and the committee appointed by the India International Centre to review the working of the Constitution. The committee which had the senior Congress leader and former cabinet minister, Dr. Karan Singh as the Chairman and included among its members two of the members of this Commission, presented its report to the President and others. Concluding recommendation of the committee was that of a Review Commission being appointed.

20. The National Agenda for Governance issued by the National Democratic Alliance as the NDA Election Manifesto before the last general elections contained a pledge that a Commission would be appointed to review the Constitution in the light of its working for fifty years. The Pledge was affirmed in the President's address to Parliament and was followed by the appointment of this Commission in February 2000.
