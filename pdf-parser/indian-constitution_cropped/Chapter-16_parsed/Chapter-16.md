# INTRODUCTION

An amendment to constitution means any change brought to the constitution by adding or deleting or modifying any provision of the constitution. The procedure for amendment determines whether a constitution is rigid or flexible. If the procedure for amending the constitution is simple, the constitution is flexible and in case the procedure is difficult the constitution is said to be rigid.

# Need for the Procedure for Amendment

Every constitution of the world contains provisions for amending the constitution. A constitution to be living, must be growing. 'If the impediments to the growth of the constitution are not removed, the constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy. The question of amending the constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and

disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of government and the public for some years now'.[1] Amendment provisions are essential for any constitution due to the following reasons:

- 1. The working of the constitution may bring out certain difficulties which needed to be addressed in order to make the constitution workable.
- 2. There is need for amendment procedure in order to prevent any one resorting to extra-constitutional means to make necessary changes for the effective functioning of the constitution.
- 3. A rigid constitution may become redundant and might lose its relevance to the society. Further, too much rigidity of the constitution will make it impossible to amend the constitution. Such instances would be another reason to adopting extraconstitutional methods which could adversely affect the national integrity.
- 4. The constitution needs to be dynamic and keep pace with the changing needs of the society. Any society as it grows requires the constitution to adapt itself to the changing needs.
- 5. Indian constitution being a social document has certain social objectives and is committed to promote social changes. Hence, there is a need for the constitution to adapt itself with the social changes that are an outcome of the constitution itself.
- 6. In the absence of a procedure for amendment, the need for change in the constitutional provisions would not be smooth. It might lead to revolutionary changes that might adversely affect the social fabric.

# AMENDMENT IN INDIA

Article 368 of the constitution provides for the procedure for amendment to constitution. However, some parts of the constitution can be amended by ordinary legislation. Rest other parts can be amended only by the procedure given in Article 368. Certain other provisions can be amended by the procedure and ratified by the states. Thus, Indian Constitution is both flexible and rigid. It is known as 'progressively rigid' constitution.

#### Constitution Amendment: Quick Facts

- Previous recommendation of President is not needed.
- Both Houses have equal powers.
- To be passed by special majority.
- No joint sitting.
- No powers for state unitary feature.
- Basic features must not be amended.

#### Procedure for Amendment

There are two broad procedures for amending the Constitution of India. They are:

- (i) Amendment by the procedure given in Article 368.
- (ii) Amendment by ordinary legislations.

<sup>1</sup> Statement of objects and reasons: The Constitution (Forty-Second Amendment) Act, 1976.

# (a) Amendment by the Procedure Given in Article 368

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

How is the Constitution of India amended? Do you think that the procedure for amendment makes the constitution a plaything in the hands of the centre? *(IAS Mains GS: 2002)*

- 1. The power to amend the constitution is vested in the union Parliament. The state legislatures do not have the power to initiate any amendment. Hence, it is a unitary power.
- 2. A bill seeking to amend the constitution can be introduced in either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. Both the Houses have equal powers and enjoy equal status in respect of the amending the constitution.
- 3. A constitution amendment bill does not require the previous recommendation of the President.
- 4. The constitution amendment bill has to be passed by a majority of total membership of the House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the House present and voting.
- 5. The bill needs to be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha separately. In case of any difference of opinion between the two Houses, then the amendment cannot be carried out. As a result, it is clear that the constitution does not provide for joint sitting, under Article 108, in case of constitution amendment bill.
- 6. After being passed by each House, the bill is to be presented to the President. After the Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971, it is binding on the President to give his assent. Thus, the President does not enjoy any veto in respect of a constitution amendment bill.
- 7. The bill has to be ratified by the legislature of at least half the number of states, for amending the following provisions mentioned in Article 368 (2) namely:
  - (a) Article 54, Article 55, Article 73, Article 162 or Article 241, or;
  - (b) Chapter IV of Part V, Chapter V of Part VI, or Chapter I of Part XI, or;Any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule, or;
  - (c) The representation of states in Parliament, or;
  - (d) The provisions of this article.

#### *Limitations on the Amendment Power*

The power to amend the constitution is subjected to certain limitations. Though the amendment power vested in the Parliament is a constituent power, it is only to enable the constitution to keep pace with the changing circumstances. It is not a power to substitute the constitution with a new constitution. The Parliament cannot increase the amendment power by using the power conferred upon it by the Article 368.

Further, in the Keshavananda Bharti case, the Supreme Court had propounded the 'Doctrine of Basic Features', under which any amendment cannot take away or abridge the basic features of the constitution.

#### Amendment Needing State Legislature Approval

- Election of President: Article 54
- Manner of election of President: Article 55
- Extent of executive power of the union: Article 73
- Extent of executive power of the states: Article 162
- High Courts for Union Territories: Article 241
- Supreme Court and high courts
- Schedule 7
- Article 368

Any amendment made to the constitution is subjected to judicial review. In case the court found the amendment to be *ultra vires* the constitution, then the court can strike it down. Recently, the Supreme Court had struck down the amendment to constitution establishing the National Judicial Appointments Commission.

In view of the above, it is clear that the constitution cannot be amended without any valid reason or arbitrarily to sub-serve any political vested interest. Hence, the amendment power and the procedure do not make the constitution a plaything in the hands of the politicians.

#### *No Joint Sessions*

Since Article 368 provides that the constitution amendment bills have to be passed by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha separately there cannot be joint session with respect to a constitution amendment bill. Article 368 (2) reads, 'An amendment of this constitution may be initiated only by the introduction of a bill for the purpose in either House of Parliament and when the bill is passed in each House…' So, in case a difference of opinion between the two Houses, then the bill cannot be passed but has to be discarded.

## (b) Amendment by Ordinary Legislations

Some of the provisions of the constitution can be amended by ordinary legislative process. Such changes to the constitution are not to be deemed as an amendment for the purpose of Article 368. Such provisions are as follows:

- 1. **Article 4:** When a new State is established or admitted under the provisions of Article 2 or when a new State is created or names of any existing State is, then the Schedule I and Schedule IV need to be amended. Such changes are consequential and need not be amended by the procedure given in Article 368. The law enacted for the purpose shall itself make the required amendments to the First and the Fourth Schedules and supplemental, incidental and consequential matter.
- 2. **Article 4:** When a new State is created or names area or boundary of any existing State under Article 3, then the Schedule I and Schedule IV need to be amended. Such changes are consequential and need not be amended by the procedure given in Article 368. The law enacted for the purpose shall itself make the required amendments to the First and the Fourth Schedules and supplemental, incidental and consequential matter.
- 3. **Article 169**: Parliament is empowered to create or abolish Legislative Council of a State. When the Council is created or abolished the 'supplemental, incidental and consequential' changes required can be brought by the law creating or abolishing the Council and procedure under Article 368 need not be adopted.

#### Amendment by Ordinary Law

- 1. Article 4
- 2. Article 169

- 5. Article 243M
- 6. Article 243ZC
- 9. Schedule V
- 10. Schedule VI

3. Article 239A 4. Article 239AA

- 4. **Article 239A:** Parliament is empowered to create of local legislatures or Council of Ministers or both for certain UTs by a law. In case this requires any amendment to the constitution it shall not be deemed to be an amendment for the purpose of Article 368.
- 5. **Article 239AA:** Any law-making provisions for giving effect to, or supplementing the provisions relating to the special provisions for National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.

- 6. **Article 243M:** Law of the Parliament to extend the provisions of Part IX, *panchayats*, to the Scheduled Areas and the tribal areas.

- 10. Any law amending the provisions of the Schedule V.
- 11. Any law amending the provisions of the Schedule VI.

The first amendment act was enacted immediately after one year the constitution coming into force. The amendment was needed to operationalize 'reservation' guaranteed by Article 16(4) in public employments in favour of backward classes. The concept of 'special protection' or 'positive discrimination' was introduced to enable reservation.

It amended Article 19 (2) and introduced seven grounds except 'sovereignty and integrity of India<sup>'(2)</sup> on which the right to freedom of speech and expression can be restricted.

The amendment also inserted Article 31A. Article 31A provides for exempting any law for compulsory requisitioning or acquisitioning of property or taking over the management of any organization in the interest of public even if the law infringed on the rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 31.

It also inserted Article 31B and Schedule IX. Article 31B grants exemption to any law included in Schedule IX from being declared invalid on the ground of violating fundamental rights.

# (b) Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Highlight the significance of the 24th Amendment to the Constitution of India?

*IAS Mains GS (1999)*

<sup>2</sup> Inserted by Constitution (16th Amendment) Act, 1963.

It was enacted in 1971 in order to override the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Golaknath case. It amended Articles 13 and 368.

#### *Golaknath Case*

In the Golaknath case, the Supreme Court ruled that:

- (a) The power to amend the constitution is not a constituent power but only an ordinary legislative power.
- (b) Article 368 provides only the procedure for amendment and does not confer any power on the Parliament.
- (c) Parliament derives the power to amend from Article 246.
- (d) Parliament does not have the power to amend the fundamental rights.

#### *24th Amendment*

In order to override the Golaknath case judgement, the 24th amendment was enacted. The main provisions of the amendment are:

- (a) The title of Article 368 was amended. Changed to 'Power of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and procedure therefore'.
- (b) Inserted Clause 3 to Article 368. It exempts the any amendment from Article 13.
- (c) Inserted Clause 4 to Article 13. It exempts the constitution amendment act from the meaning of law in Article 13 (3).
- (d) As a result, the constitution amendment act is immunized from judicial review.
- (e) Thus, the power of the Parliament to amend the constitution is a constituent power.

#### *Keshavananda Bharti Case*

The 24th Amendment was challenged in the Keshavananda Bharti case. In this case the Court overruled its judgement in the Golaknath case. The main provisions are:

- (a) The court upheld the 24th amendment to the constitution.
- (b) Article 368 does not only provide for the procedure for amendment, but also confers the power on the Parliament.
- (c) The Parliament has the power to amend any part of the constitution including Preamble and fundamental rights.
- (d) The court propounded the concept of 'Basic Features'. The Parliament can amend any part of the constitution but cannot takeaway or alter the basic features of the constitution.

(e) Judicial review being a basic feature cannot be taken away and hence, constitution amendment is subjected to judicial review.

#### 'Basic Features'

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What constitutes the doctrine of the 'basic features' as introduced into the Constitution of India by the judiciary? *IAS Mains GS (2000)*

The concept of basic features was not part of the original constitution, but was propounded by the Supreme Court in the Keshavananda Bharti case. Basic features of the constitution are the fundamental values that reflect the philosophy of the constitution. They form the basic foundation and provide the fundamental structure of the constitution. Hence, taking away the basic features or amending them would amount to abrogating the constitution. Hence, they cannot be taken away.

'Amendment' is to enable the constitution to conform to the socio-political and socio-economic changes. It is implied that the old constitution survives without losing its identity, though certain changes are brought to it. Hence, the amendment cannot abrogate the basic structure of the original constitution.

Thus, the Supreme Court restored the constitutional supremacy. The Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament does not have unlimited law-making power and rejected parliamentary supremacy. Any law, including constitutional amendment, is subjected to judicial review and an amendment can be challenged on the ground of violating the basic features.

However, the Supreme Court ruled that an exhaustive list of what constitutes the basic structure cannot be drawn at one go. They have to determined based on the facts involved in any case. In several cases the Supreme Court had declared the following as the basic features. Rule of Law, judicial review, democracy, which implies free and fair elections, secularism, etc., are few among them.

### (c) Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976

#### Why 42nd Amendment?

- • To spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation.
- To make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights.To specify the fundamental duties of the citizens.
- • To make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities, whether by individuals or associations.
- To establish Administrative Tribunals to reduce the mounting arrears in high courts and to secure speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other matters of special importance.

42nd Amendment Act, 1976, is sometimes known as 'mini constitution' as it had left no part of the constitution. It was enacted when the proclamation of National Emergency was in operation. The statement of objectives of the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, states that 'the democratic institutions provided in the constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities, whether by individuals or associations.' Thus, the act is significant in many respects and few important among those are as follows:

1. **Amendment to Article 31C**: Article 31C was inserted by the 25th Amendment. It exempts any law enacted to implement the DPSP provided in Articles 39 (b) and 39 (c) from being declared invalid even in case the law infringed upon the fundamental rights. Thus, it grants supremacy to the DPSP given in Articles 39 (b) and (c) over the fundamental rights. According to the Supreme Court, Articles 39 (b) and (c) represent the 'Doctrine of Distributive Justice' and are essential for achieving the socialistic goals of the constitution. Hence, they needed to be provided with such immunity.

 42nd Amendment expanded the scope of Article 31C to cover all the DPSPs. Thus, Article 31C would immunize any law to implement any of the DPSPs. It was arguing that DPSPs represent the collective liberties of the society and they must be given supremacy to fundamental rights. DPSP must be implemented to enable the citizens to enjoy their fundamental rights completely. However, this amendment was declared invalid by the Supreme Court in the Minerva Mills case.<sup>[3]</sup>

- 2. **Insertion of Article 39A:** After Article 39, a new Article 39A was inserted. This article provides for 'Equal justice and free legal aid'. 'An important impact of Article 39A read with Article 21 has been to reinforce the right of a person involved in a criminal proceeding to legal aid.'<sup>[3]</sup> Further, the Court in the Kishore versus state of Himachal Pradesh case ruled that 'Legal aid may be treated as a part of the right created under Article 21'.
- 3. **Insertion of Article 43A, 48A and 51A:** It is inserted Article 43A which provides for participative management of industries. Article 48A provides for 'Protection and improvement of environ-

ment and safeguarding of forests and wild life'. Thus, it infuses the environmental consciousness in the constitution.

Further, it also added Part IVA and inserted Article 51A to the constitution. Part IVA contains the fundamental duties prescribed to the citizens. It was borrowed from the Japanese and Soviet Constitutions. Though they are not enforceable it creates an obligation to the citizens.

- 4. **Amendment of Article 74:** Article 74 was amended and made the advice of the Council of Ministers binding on the President. This created the debate on the constitutional position of the President.
- 5. **Insertion of Part XIVA: Administrative Tribunals:** The amendment inserted Part XIVA, Article 323A and Article 323B. It empowers the Parliament to enact law to establish Administrative Tribunals. Article 323A provides for tribunals for settling 'of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of any State'.

Article 323B provide for setting up of tribunal for 'the adjudication or trial by tribunals of any disputes, complaints, or offences with respect to levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax, foreign exchange, import and export across customs frontiers, industrial and labour disputes, land reforms by way of acquisition by the State of any estate, etc.

## (d) Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978

The amendment is important because it along with the 43rd and 45th amendment, attempted to set right the anomalies created by the 42nd amendment. The following are the important aspects of the 44th amendment:

1. **Amendment of Article 74:** 44th amendment in a way restored the position of the President. 42nd amendment made the advice of the Council of Ministers binding on the President. This literally made President a mere 'rubber stamp' endorsing the decisions of the Council. But this is not the position envisaged by the founding fathers.

 However, 44th amendment did not completely restore the position of the President. It inserted a proviso to Article 74 (1). The proviso reads 'that the President may require the Council of Ministers to reconsider such advice, either generally or otherwise, and the President shall act in accordance with the advice tendered after such reconsideration'. Thus, the President can effectively return the advice tendered by the Council for reconsideration once. In such a circumstance, the Council must reconsider and advice the President. In case the Council tenders the same advice after reconsideration, then it is binding on the President.

 The significance of this amendment is that it had removed the discretion of the President to reject the advice tendered by the Council and act on his own. Before this amendment, it was possible for the President to get the advice form the Council to satisfy the constitution, reject it and act in his discretion. Thus, there was a possibility of the President acting alike a 'dictator'. After the 44th amendment that has been made impossible. Hence, there is a view that 'the President before the 44th amendment could have been more assertive'.[5]

#### Do You Know?

**RA 80** 

The 44th amendment provided for a referendum of people to pass any amendment that would effect of impairing its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights, prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage or compromising the independence of judiciary.

<sup>5</sup> IAS Mains (2004) Public Administration Paper II.

2. **Amendment to Article 38 and Repealing Right to Property:** Article 38 in the original constitution was renumbered as Article 38 (1) and a Clause 2 was inserted. Article 38 (2) reads 'the State shall, in particular, strive to minimize the inequalities in income, and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations'.

 When looked plainly, this clause appears colourless and innocently silent. But this amendment was the reason for the repealing the right to property as a fundamental right. The amendment embodies the concept of socialism as envisaged in the Preamble. The amendment provided for the removal of right to property from Part III and made it a constitutional right.

 The statement of objectives of 44th amendment declares 'In view of the special position sought to be given to fundamental rights, the right to property, which has been the occasion for more than one amendment of the constitution, would cease to be a fundamental right and become only a legal right. Necessary amendments for this purpose are being made to Articles 19 and 31 is being deleted. It would, however, be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental rights would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice'.

- 3. **Insertion of Article 134A:** In order to safeguard the time of the Supreme Court and to avoiding delays in disposing the cases Article 134A was inserted. It empowers the high courts to grant certificates in cases that merit an appeal to Supreme Court. This also discourages the practice of appealing to the Supreme Court as a matter of routine.
- 4. **Amendment to Emergency Provisions:** 44th amendment made elaborate changes in Article 352, in order to ensure that the provision is not misused. In 1975, the national emergency was proclaimed under Article 352 on the ground of 'internal disturbance'. This is regarded as a dark page of Indian democracy. After 1978, proclamation of emergency has been made more stringent.

 The statement of objectives of 44th amendment declares 'A Proclamation of Emergency under Article 352 has virtually the effect of amending the constitution by converting it for the duration into that of a unitary State and enabling the rights of the citizen to move the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights including the right to life and liberty to be suspended. Adequate safeguards are, therefore, necessary to ensure that this power is properly exercised and is not abused. It is, therefore, proposed that a Proclamation of Emergency can be issued only when the security of India or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion. Internal disturbance not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for the issue of a Proclamation'.

#### Do You Know?

- 'Cabinet' an extraconstitutional body was recognized by 44th amendment.
- The term 'Internal Disturbance' was deleted from Article 352 but continues to remain in Article 355.
- 5. **Insertion of Article 361A: Protection of Media Freedom**

Article 361A is the provision 'guaranteeing the right of the media to report freely and without censorship the proceedings in Parliament and the state legislatures'.[6] It protects any person who publishes anything related to the proceedings of the House of legislatures if the House had not restrained the publishing of the same.
