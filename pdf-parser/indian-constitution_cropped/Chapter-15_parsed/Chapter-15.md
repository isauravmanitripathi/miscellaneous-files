# INTRODUCTION

Articles 168 to 213 in chapter 3 of Part VI of the constitution deal with state legislature. The constitution provides for parliamentary form of government in both union and states. Hence, it provides for a bicameral legislature in the states also. However, in the states, the Legislative Council can be created or abolished according to the will of the Legislative Assembly. Unlike the Rajya Sabha, the Legislative Council is not a standing house.

Article 168, provides that the state legislature shall comprises the Governor, Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. The Governor is not a member of state legislature but he is constituent part of the state legislature. However, only in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh there are state Legislative Council.[1] In rest other, states there is only one House.

# CREATION OR ABOLITION OF LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

Article 169 provides for the creation or abolition of Legislative Council of the state. The Legislative Council is created or abolished by a law of the Parliament. The law to create or abolish the Council is an ordinary legislation.

The Parliament shall create or abolish the Council if the state Legislative Assembly passes a resolution, requesting the Parliament, by a majority of the total membership of the house and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting.

Once created or abolished article the name of the state needs to be either inserted or deleted from Article 168. Any such change to Article 168 is not to be deemed as an amendment to the constitution and the procedure for amendment given in Article 368 need not be followed.

<sup>1</sup> Here Jammu and Kashmir is not included because according to the special status accede to the state under Article 370, the provision of Article 168 does not apply to the state.

#### Composition of State Legislative Council

Article 171 provides for the composition of the Legislative Council. The total strength of the Legislative Council must not exceed one-third of the total strength of the Legislative Assembly. However, in any case the 'total number of members in the Legislative Council of a state shall in no case be less than forty'. Article 171 (3) provides for the composition of the Legislative Council as:

- (a) One-third of the member of the Council shall be elected by members of municipalities, district boards and such other local authorities in the state.
- (b) One-twelfth shall be elected by persons who have been for at least three years graduates of any university in the territory of India or have been for at least three years in possession of qualifications prescribed by or under any law made by Parliament as equivalent to that of a graduate of any such university, residing in the state
- (c) One-twelfth shall be elected by persons who have been engaged in teaching in such educational institutions within the state, not lower in standard than that of a secondary school, for at least three years
- (d) One-third shall be elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly of the state from amongst persons who are not members of the Assembly.
- (e) The remainder one-sixth shall be nominated by the Governor from persons having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service.

The members of the Legislative Council to be elected by the members of the local bodies, graduates and teachers shall be chosen in such territorial constituencies. The members of the Legislative Council to be elected by the members of the Legislative Assembly are elected in the election held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. However, Article 171 (2) empowers the Parliament to determine the composition of the state Legislative Councils.

#### Origin of State Legislature

Regulating Act, 1773: Legislative power of the presidencies recognized.

Charter Act, 1833: Deprived provinces of independent legislative power.

Charter Act of 1853: Law member of Governor-in-Council made a full member and paved way for establishing first legislative body.

Indian Councils Act, 1861: Restored legislative power of provincial legislatures taken away by the Charter of 1833 were and made them mere advisory bodies.

Indian Councils Act, 1909: Made the legislatures an elected body but by indirect election. Government of India Act, 1919: Introduced dyarchy in provinces and provincial legislatures made law-making body.

#### *Legislative Council Versus Rajya Sabha*

Unlike Rajya Sabha there is minimum and maximum ceiling in respect of the membership of the Legislative Council. The strength of Rajya Sabha is not based on the strength of the Lok Sabha whereas the Legislative Council strength cannot be more than one-third of the strength of Legislative Assembly.

While Rajya Sabha cannot be abolished the Legislative Council can be abolished by a law of Parliament if requested by the Legislative Assembly. The existence of the Council is dependent on the will of the Legislative Assembly whereas Rajya Sabha exists independent of the Lok Sabha. Rajya Sabha is a federal House and Legislative Council does not play any such role.

While Rajya Sabha enjoys equal powers with Lok Sabha in certain respects the Legislative Council is completely subordinated to the Legislative Assembly. Hence, Rajya Sabha is the second House and the Legislative Council is a secondary House to Legislative Assembly.

### *Utility of the Legislative Council*

- (a) The Legislative Council acts an active link between the local bodies and the state legislature.
- (b) It acts as a revising house of the policy proposals and legislations originating in the Legislative Assembly.
- (c) The Council provides opportunity for the graduates to participate in the legislative process.
- (d) The membership of teachers in the Legislative Council enables the political socialization process.
- (e) The review of the policy proposals and legislations originating in the Legislative Assembly by the Council which is a body of senior statesmen, graduates, teachers and local body representatives adds value to them. Further the review by the House helps to get rid of person-centric politics.
- (f) The provision for nomination of members by Governor helps the Chief Ministers to include persons of eminence in his Council and their knowledge and experience is available to the state.

#### Political Socialization

It refers to the learning process inculcating political values, development of political beliefs and attitudes which enables people to effectively participate in politics.

It is the process by which an individual becomes acquainted with the political system and which determines his reactions to political phenomena.

It involves formal and informal learning and could be both deliberate and unplanned.

It imparts knowledge for effective political participation and incentivizes the participation.

A politically socialized individual comes forward to assume different roles.

According to Fred Greenstein, it includes not only explicitly political learning but also nominally non-political learning that affects political behaviour.

#### *Duration of the Legislative Council*

The power to extend the term of the Assembly is vested in the Parliament. The Parliament by enacting a law extends the term.

...

#### *Qualification of Members*

#### Know the Facts

- Madras Legislative Council was the first Legislative Council to be set-up in 1861.
- Bengal Legislative Council set-up in 1862 was the second Legislative Council to be set-up in 1861.

# LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES

The legislative procedures in the state legislatures are similar to that in the Parliament. All the procedures in the Parliament relating to the motions, resolutions and bills are same as in the Parliament.

# Passage of Bills

The procedure for the passage of the ordinary bills and money bills in the state legislatures are similar to the procedure in the Parliament.

#### *Passage of Ordinary Bills*

The ordinary bill can be introduced in either House of the legislature. An ordinary bill undergoes three readings in the Houses and become law once assented to by the Governor.

#### *Ordinary Bills Originating in Legislative Assembly*

Sikkim to have 40 Member Legislative Assembly

- The number of seats in the Sikkim legislative assembly is to be increased from the existing 32 to 40 members.
- This is to accommodate the demands of the Limboo and Tamang tribes of Sikkim who were notified as scheduled tribes in 2003.
- Although the Delimitation Act 2002, postponed the readjustment of seats in Parliament and the State Legislatures until 2026, the Act does not apply to Sikkim.
- Article 371F provides the exemption from the application of Delimitation Act to Sikkim.

A bill originating in the Legislative Assembly undergoes three readings and then it is passed. After the Assembly passes the bill, it is transmitted to the Legislative Council. In the Council, the bill undergoes the same three readings. The Council does not have the powers to reject a bill originating in the Legislative Assembly.

However, the Council can retain the bill for a maximum period of three months from the date of receipt. In case the Council had any recommendations for amendment or any disagreement, then the Council has to return the bill within the said three months. On the receipt of the bill the Assembly has to reconsider the bill with the recommendations of the Council. However, the Assembly has the discretion to either accept or reject the recommendations of the Council.

After passing the bill for the second time, the bill will be transmitted to the Council again. In the second instance the Council can retain the bill for a period of one month. Within the said one month the Council has to pass the bill or return the bill with its recommendations. In that case the Assembly has to reconsider and pass the bill. At this stage, the bill will not be transmitted to the Council but is presented to the Governor for his assent. The bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses in the form in which it is passed by the Assembly.

When the bill presented to the Governor, he can either give his assent or veto the bill or reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. The President can give his assent or veto the bill or can direct the Governor to return the bill for reconsideration if it is not a money bill.

#### *Bills Originating in the Legislative Council*

A bill originating in the Legislative Council undergoes three readings in the Council and once passed is transmitted to the Legislative Assembly. If the bill is passed by the Legislative Assembly, the bill is presented to the Governor for his assent.

The Legislative Assembly has absolute power to reject the bill. In case the assembly rejects the bill, the bill is dead and buried. If the Assembly returns the bill with its recommendations for amendment to the Legislative Council, then the recommendations are binding on the Council and the Council has to incorporate the recommendations and pass the bill again. Once passed again the bill is transmitted to the Assembly. In the second instance also, the Assembly has the power to reject the bill.

Thus, the Assembly enjoys absolute power in respect of the ordinary bills over the Legislative Council. But the Council is only a secondary House to the Assembly.

#### *Deadlock between the Houses*

In the state legislature because of the superior position of the Legislative Assembly, there is no possibility of deadlock between the two Houses. Hence, there is no provision for joint sitting in the states.

Further, the Legislative Councils owe their existence to the Legislative Assembly and hence not all the states have two Houses. Hence there is no provision for joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the deadlock.

| 1. An ordinary bill may be introduced in<br>either House (Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha).                                                                                                                                                                                  | 1. An ordinary bill may be introduced in either house<br>(Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2. A bill is passed by the Parliament when<br>both the Houses agree to the bill with or<br>without amendments.                                                                                                                                                        | 2. A bill is passed by the state legislature when<br>both Houses agree to the bill with or without<br>amendments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <b>3.</b> Final disagreement is said to take place<br>where a House after receiving a bill passed<br>by another house:<br>• Rejects the bill, or; Proposes<br>amendments which the other House<br>does not accept, or;<br>• Does not pass the bill within six months. | <b>3.</b> Final disagreement is said to take place where<br>a House after receiving a bill passed by the other<br>House:<br>• Rejects the bill, or;<br>• Proposes amendments which the other House<br>does not accept, or;<br>• Does not pass the bill within three months.                                                                                      |
| 4. In the situation described as final<br>disagreement above, a deadlock arises.<br>The situation is resolved by calling a joint<br>sitting of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.                                                                                         | 4. In the situation described above, there is<br>no provision for joint sitting in case of state<br>legislature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. The Lok Sabha cannot override the Rajya<br>Sabha by passing a bill a second time.<br>The only way to resolve the deadlock is a<br>joint sitting.                                                                                                                   | 5. If the Assembly passes the bill for the second<br>time and transmits it to the Council, the Council<br>may withhold it for the period of one month in<br>this second journey. Even if the Council rejects<br>the bill or proposes amendments which are not<br>acceptable to the Assembly, the bill is deemed to<br>have been passed by the state legislature. |
| 6. The procedure for resolving deadlock<br>applies to ordinary bills whether originating<br>in the Lok Sabha or in the Rajya Sabha.                                                                                                                                   | 6. The above procedure of passing a bill twice<br>applies only in the case of a bill originating in the<br>Legislative Assembly.<br>If a bill which has originated in the Council and<br>was transmitted to the Assembly is rejected by<br>the Assembly, such rejection brings the bill to a<br>final end. The bill becomes dead.                                |

#### *Passage of Money Bills*

The procedure for the passage of money bills is similar to that in the union Parliament. The money bill cannot be introduced in the Legislative Council. It can be introduced only in the Legislative Assembly. It

**000** 

can be introduced only with the previous recommendation of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly has the powers to certify a money bill and his decision is final.

The money bill after being passed by the Assembly is transmitted to the Legislative Council which can retain the bill for a period of 14 days. Within the said 14 days, the Council has to return the bill with or without its recommendations. It is the discretion of the Assembly to either accept or reject the recommendations. Once passed by the Assembly, the bill is presented to the Governor for his assent.

On receiving the money bill the Governor may declare that he gives his assent to the bill or he may reject the bill or reserve the bill for the consideration of the President. But the Governor cannot return the money bill for the reconsideration of the House.

#### *Constitution Amendment Bills*

The state legislatures do not have the power to initiate any amendment to the constitution. Amendment power is centralized with the Parliament. Only in respect of certain amendments according to Article 368 (2), the state legislatures have the limited power of ratifying the amendments.

#### Bills to be Reserved for the Consideration of the President

According to Article 200, if a bill once becoming a law would derogate the power of the High Court and endanger the position of the High Court then the Governor has to reserve the bill for the consideration of the President.
