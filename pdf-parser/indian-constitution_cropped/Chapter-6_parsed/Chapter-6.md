# INTRODUCTION

In India fundamental rights can be traced to Motilal Nehru Committee Report 1928. The term fundamental rights have not been defined objectively. There are widely accepted meanings of the term. Fundamental rights are defined as the rights which are essential for a human being, in a civilized society, to utilize his fullest possible potential to the fullest possible extent to achieve the fullest possible development.

#### 'Nehru Report'

- All Parties Conference on 19 May 1928 appointed committee headed by Motilal Nehru to work out details of the constitution.
- It recommended for inclusion of a Declaration of Rights in the constitution to assure fullest liberty of conscience and religion.
- Syed Ali Imam and Shoaib Qureshi were the two Muslims members of the nine-member committee.

# Reasons for Having Fundamental Rights

According to Professor Laski, the civil liberties enjoyed by the citizens determine whether a democracy succeeds or fails. A true democracy needs to limit the will of the majority so that it does not become a 'tyrannical rule by majority'. In a modern democracy, this is sought to be done by guaranteeing the bill of rights. Unlimited political power vested in a body of men will eliminate the liberties to express dissent and ensure the government accountability. Instead, it will breed submissiveness and will result in a totalitarian system. This requires the incorporation of fundamental rights in any modern constitution. The following are the main reasons for incorporating fundamental rights in any modern democratic constitution:

- According to the political philosophy, any good rule has to ensure the presence of all the conditions which are essential for the pursuit of 'happiness' of a human being. It is the ultimate aim of human birth. This can be possible only by guaranteeing the fundamental rights.
- The conflict between the liberties of the individual and those of the society is common in any society. This conflict is balanced by the fundamental rights and conditions for the peaceful and harmonious coexistence is created.
- The state personifies the collective liberties of the society and in that process may assume absolute power resulting in tyranny. This can be prevented only by guaranteeing the fundamental rights. India under the British rule witnessed the state using its legitimate power against the subjects to suppress them.
- Every society has its own historical errors which has rendered a section of the population underprivileged or deprived. For instance, in India the practice of untouchability had resulted in the discriminative treatment of people which was justified as an accepted social practice. To correct these historical errors fundamental rights are needed.
- Every society aims at modernizing its social, cultural, and economic institutions. Such modernization requires changes to be brought in the social values, attitudes and aspirations of the people. Such changes have to be smooth and harmonious. This can be possible only by guaranteeing the fundamental rights.
- Lastly, democracy has rights of the citizens as its central element. The 'success and failure of the democracy depends on the extent to which the liberties are enjoyed by the citizens'.<sup>[1]</sup>

A common device to ensure this is the fundamental rights.

#### Why Fundamental Rights?

- Creating conditions for pursuit of happiness.
- Resolving conflict between collective liberties of society and the individual liberties.
- Preventing state tyranny.
- Correcting historical errors of the society.
- Modernizing the society.
- Preserving democracy.

#### Why Fundamental Rights are Needed for India?

Indian society is characterized by religious and linguistic diversity and cultural differences. So to build confidence in the minds of the religious and linguistic minorities fundamental rights need to be guaranteed. Guaranteed fundamental rights are the antidote to communalism and casteism. When the individual is guaranteed with the rights such problems might get resolved on their own.

Secondly, the guaranteed fundamental rights would build a set of values in the society and regulate the conduct of the individuals and state, especially the legislature and the executive.

Thirdly, the fundamental rights will act as a reminder for the legislature and the executive whenever there is a violation of the rights.

Fourthly, the rights would enable the citizen to organize himself against any such measure.

Fifthly, the experience India had under the British rule. The brutal use of the state's power against its own subject was witnessed before independence and hence, such situations must be prevented in the free India.

<sup>1</sup> Professor Laski: Liberty in the Modern State: Discussion on implications of democracy.

Sixthly, Indian society has been a strictly hierarchically organized society in which the status differential was prominent. The status difference has conferred the special status and associated privileges to certain sections and rendered another section deprived. As a consequence, the 'enterprising middle class was denied equality of opportunity in securing a fair share in the administration.<sup> $(2)$ </sup> To remedy such wrongs, they were elevated as fundamental rights.

There is another view that Indian society is different from other societies that Indian society is a state built society' within the framework of the constitution. Though India existed as a cultural space for centuries, the political unification and organizing the society of modern times is more done by the state. This can be understood by the prescription of values like socialism by the constitution to the society. Article 38 expressly provides for 'securing social order' based on justice. So, in this process there is every possibility for the state to assume a greater power that may be adversely affecting the rights of the citizen. Hence, the fundamental rights are guaranteed.

#### GUARANTEED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS: MEANING AND NEED

Guaranteed fundamental rights refer to such rights that are enforced in a court of law. Without being enforceable, the fundamental rights become meaningless. Hence, they need to guaranteed due to the following reasons:

- Pattern of politics and associated controversies are not constant and they are ever-changing. Fundamental rights have to be kept out of such uncertainties and so they need to be guaranteed. Otherwise, the rights will be subjected to the free interpretation of political conditions.
- Fundamental rights must be established as legal principles which the court will apply as standards while determining the cases. Hence, they have to be kept away from the reach of the majority in the legislature and officials in the government.
- To protect the individual citizens from the excesses of the state actions.

#### UNENUMERATED AND ENUMERATED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

Certain constitutions do not expressly enumerate the fundamental rights. They are left to be understood by the citizen by deducing them from the law. For this the citizen is required to know law. English constitution is an example. Certain other constitutions expressly mention the list of fundamental rights. For instance, Indian constitution contains a list of fundamental rights. Given the low rate of literacy in India, people cannot be expected to know law for exercising their fundamental rights. Hence, the founding fathers of the constitution chose to provide enumerated fundamental rights.

# FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

- 1. Discuss the provisions of the Human Rights Protection Act (1993) relating to the following:
  - (a) Definition of human rights.
  - (b) Composition of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
  - (c) Functions of the commission.
  - (d) What suggestions have been made for amending the act for making the role of the NHRC effective?

<sup>2</sup> Fundamental rights constituent assembly view as given in 'Constitutional Government in India': M. V. Pylee

Human rights, according to the UN Human Rights Declaration, 1948, are the rights that are fundamental to all men and women that enable them to use all possible talents, skills abilities, the power of reasoning in order to achieve maximum possible extent their material and spiritual goals. Almost all the fundamental rights included the meaning of human rights. However, these two sets of rights differ in the following

#### CLASSIFICATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

The fundamental rights in the constitution can be classified on the certain bases such as:

- Those available to citizens and aliens
- Negatively worded and positively worded
- Limitations imposed
- Against state and/or private
- Public and private rights

#### Those Available to Citizens and Aliens

Some of the fundamental rights are granted only to citizens and these rights are addressed to 'citizens'. Such rights are:

- Article 15: Protection from discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.Article 16: Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment.
- Article 19: Freedoms of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence and profession.
- Article 30: Cultural and educational rights of minorities. Certain other rights are available to both citizens and also to aliens. These rights are worded as 'persons'. Such rights are:
- Article 14: Equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.

<sup>4</sup> Article 226 is not mentioned here because the guarantee of the fundamental rights is expressly provided in the Article 32 and Article 226 is the power of the High Courts to enforce fundamental rights. Article 32 (1) reads, 'The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part is guaranteed'.

- Article 20: Protection in respect of conviction against *ex post facto* laws, double punishment and self-incrimination.
- Article 21: Protection of life and personal liberty against action without authority of law.
- Article 23: Right against exploitation.
- Article 25: Freedom of religion.
- Article 27: Freedom as to payment of taxes for the promotion of any particular religion.
- Article 28: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or worship in state educational institutions.

#### Negatively Worded and Positively Worded

Some of the fundamental rights are negatively worded and act as prohibitions to the state.

- Article 14: The state shall not deny to any person equality before the law.
- Article 15 (1): The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.
- Article 16 (2): No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the state.
- Articles 18 (1) and (2): No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the state. No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign state.
- Article 20: No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.
- Article 21: No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.
- Article 22 (1): No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.
- Article 28 (1): No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of state funds.

Some of the fundamental rights are positively worded which confer some benefits upon the individual. Such rights are:

- Article 25: Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion.
- Article 26: Freedom to manage religious affairs.
- Article 29: Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same.
- Article 30: All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

# Limitations Imposed

Fundamental rights are classified on the basis of the limitation they impose on the executive and legislature.

For instance, Article 21 imposes limitation on the executive but does not impose limitation on the legislature. On the other hand, the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 15, 17, 18, 20 and 24 completely and absolutely restrict the legislatures. The legislatures cannot regulate or restrict the exercise of the said rights.

n n n

Article 19, falls in-between these two categories of fundamental rights. Article 19 empowers the legislatures to impose restrictions on the fundamental rights on the prescribed grounds.

#### Against State and/or Private

Certain rights are guaranteed against the state, that is, when the state violates or infringes such rights the remedy will be available under Article 32. However, in case of any violation of such rights by private individuals then the ordinary legal remedies are available. The rights guaranteed by Articles 19 and 21 are examples.

Certain rights are available both against the state private individuals. Such rights are:

- Articles 15 (2): Equality in regard to access to and use of places of public resort.
- Articles 17: Prohibition of untouchability.
- Articles 18 (3) and (4): Prohibition of acceptance of foreign title.
- Articles 23: Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour.
- Articles 24: Prohibition of employment of children in hazardous employment.

#### Public and Private Rights

The constituent assembly classified the fundamental rights into two broad categories, namely, public and private rights. Public rights also known as political rights are the right to choose the government, make it accountable, citizen's right to play a role in policy-making, etc. Private rights are those such as the right to personal freedom, religion, freedom of thought and expression, etc.

#### FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

The original constitution provides for a set of seven fundamental rights namely:

- 1. Right to equality
- 2. Right to particular freedoms
- 3. Right against exploitation
- 3. Right to freedom of religion
- 4. Cultural and educational rights
- 5. Right to property
- 6. Right to constitutional remedies

Of the seven fundamental rights, the right to property has been repealed as a fundamental right by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act 1978.

#### Points to Remember

- The right to own and administer property is not an absolute right. It is subject to reasonable regulation by the state.
- Property of a religious institution can be acquired under Article 31 A (1) (a) for effecting agrarian reform.
- Right to property was omitted because validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the state legislatures led to many litigations.
- Article 31 C was inserted because of litigations relating to adequacy of compensation for the property acquisitioned by government.

#### Right to Property

Original constitution provided the right to property as a fundamental right under Article 19 (1) (f) as a particular freedom and Article 31. However, the right had to be repealed as a fundamental right as it was preventing the implementation of the land reforms.

Initially, the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, inserted Article 31 A to provide for exemption, from being invalidated on the ground of conflicting with Articles 14, 19 and 31, to the laws seeking:

- Acquisitioning and requisitioning of properties.
- Taking over of the management of any property by the state for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property.
- The amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations.

However, this exemption did not serve the purpose as it resulted in litigations relating to compensation. Subsequently, Article 31 C was inserted by the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act 1971. Article 31 C provides for exempting any law which gives effect to provisions of Article 39 (b) and (c) from being invalidated even if it violated any of the fundamental rights. Despite this the disputes relating to the compensation kept rising. This finally resulted in the omission of right to property as a fundamental right.

#### *Right to Property Omitted*

The Constitution (44th Amendment Act) 1978, renumbered Article 38 as Article 38 (1) and inserted clause 2 to Article 38. Article 38 (2) reads as follows:

'The state shall, in particular, strive to minimize the inequalities in income, and endeavour to eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only amongst individuals but also amongst groups of people residing in different areas or engaged in different vocations.'

This amendment paved the way for the omission of the right to property as a fundamental right.

#### *Right to Property Still a Fundamental Right*

However, the right is still a fundamental right to certain category of people. Such categories are as follows:

- According to Article 31 A, the state cannot acquisition or requisition the property of any person if:
- The property is agricultural land within the limits of ceiling imposed by the law.
- It is under his personal cultivation.It is his only means of livelihood.

In such case, the property becomes a fundamental right as Article 31 A is within part III (fundamental rights) of the constitution and hence, the remedy under Article 32 is available to any violation of the right.

According to Article 26, any religious denomination or group is entitled to own, acquire and maintain property, both immovable and movable, in accordance with law. This is part of the fundamental right to freedom of religion.

According to Article 30 (1A), inserted by the Constitution (44th Amendment Act) 1978, confers the property rights of the educational institutions established by minorities. In case the property owned by such institutions is to be acquisitioned then 'the state shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause'. In case of any dispute in this regard, the remedy lies under Article 32.

Hence, right to property is still a fundamental right to the above three categories of people. For the rest, the right to property has been made a constitutional right. The 44th Amendment inserted Article 300A, which makes right to property a constitutional right.

#### Application to Jammu and Kashmir

Since the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been accorded a special status, the fundamental rights are applicable to the state subject to the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. Accordingly:

- In Article 13, the references 'the commencement of the constitution' shall be read as the commencement of the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.
- Article 16 (3) is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Parliament is empowered to enact law for the prescribing 'residence' as a qualification for public employment in any state.
- Article 19 (1) (f): Though the provision is omitted by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, for the purpose of Jammu and Kashmir, it shall read as 'to acquire, hold and dispose of property'. So, the permanent resident of Jammu and Kashmir will have the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property.
- Article 30 (1 A): Is not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.
- Article 31 (Right to Property): This is inserted after Article 30.
- Article 31 C is not applicable to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
- Article 32 (3) is not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.
- Article 35 A shall be inserted after Article 35.

#### Right to Property in Jammu and Kashmir: Article 31

Article 31 was inserted under the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. It deals with the compulsory acquisitioning of property. The provisions of Article 31 are as follows:

- No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.
- No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for an amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law; and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash:

Provided that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause (1) of Article 30, the state shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause.

- Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the state or to a corporation owned or controlled by the state, it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property, notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property.
- Nothing in sub-clause (f) of clause (1) of Article 19 shall affect any such law as is referred to in clause (2).
