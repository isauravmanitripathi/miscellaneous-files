# INTRODUCTION

Coordination between the units of the federation is fundamental for the success and strength of the federal polity. But in view of the peculiar conditions of this country and, especially the developments at the time of independence, the union control over state governments has been provided. The reasons have already been explained in Chapter 2. Thus, the relationship between the Centre and the States is tilted in favour of the Centre. However, without the cooperation between the Centre and the States 'cooperative federalism' cannot operate. The concept of 'cooperative federalism' envisaged by the founding fathers of the Indian Constitution vindicates this. The relationship between the Centre and the States can be studied as that in:

- Legislative sphere
- Administrative sphere
- Financial sphere

Of these in the executive and legislative spheres the relations are federal in nature, whereas there is no federal relation in the financial sphere.

#### Instruments of Cooperative Federalism

- Interstate council
- Zonal council
- Statutory bodies to coordinate in specific areas like education: UGC
- • Joint venture by Central and State governments: Damodar Valley Corporation
- Central and State governments mutually granting tax immunity

### (A) LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS (ARTICLES 245–254)

According to Article 245, the Parliament has the power to make law for the whole of the territory of India and the State legislatures have the power to make law only for the State. However, the laws made by the Parliament have an extraterritorial jurisdiction that is the laws are valid even out of the territory of India wherever relevant.

Article 246, provide for the subject matters on which the Parliament and the State legislatures have powers to make law. Accordingly, the Parliament has 'exclusive' powers to make law on the matters in the List I (Union List) in Schedule VII. The State legislatures have the power to enact law on matters in the List II (State List).

In this context it is relevant to recall the Doctrine of Pith and Substance.<sup>[1]</sup> Since the jurisdiction of the Parliament and the State legislatures are exclusive in their respective spheres, there must not be any encroachment by either of them. The court applies the Doctrine of Pith and Substance to ascertain this. Any law that is made deliberately to encroach upon the jurisdiction not belonging to it is known as 'Colourable Legislation' and is struck down by the court as unconstitutional.

With respect to the matters in the Concurrent List both Parliament and the State legislatures have equal powers to make laws. However, this is subjected to the provision of Article 254. It deals with the inconsistency between the laws made by the Parliament and State legislatures. In case any provision of a law made by a State legislature on a matter in Concurrent List conflicts with any provision of a law made by the Parliament on the same subject, then the law enacted by the Parliament shall prevail over the law made by the State.

However, according to Article 254 (2), if the State law has been reserved for the consideration of the President and he has given his assent, then the law shall remain applicable for that State. For the rest of the States the Parliament law will be applicable. But the Parliament has the powers to override or amend the State law if needed.

Article 248 vests the 'residuary powers' in the union. Hence, the power to make law on any such matter that is not enumerated in any of the Lists in Schedule VII. This includes the power to make any law that imposes tax. The States do not have any power with regard to such matters.

#### Distribution of Legislative Powers Notable Features

- Three-fold distribution of legislative power.
- Maintaining supremacy of federal laws
- • Vesting the 'Residuary Powers' in centre
- Power of Parliament to legislate on State subjects during emergency.

#### Power of the Parliament to Make Law on State Subjects

Although the legislative relations between the union and the States are federal in nature there are certain circumstances in which the Parliament can enact law on the matters in the State List.

• Article 249 empowers Parliament to enact law on any matter in the State List. If the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution that it is expedient in the interest of the nation, then the Parliament can make law on any subject on State List. Such resolution has to be 'supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the House'. Such resolution has the validity of one year from the date of passing. However, the validity of the resolution may be extended. Such a law will cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of six months after the resolution has ceased to be in force [Article 249 (3)].

<sup>1</sup> Refer the Chapter on Judiciary.

- Article 250 confers on the Parliament unlimited powers to make law on any matter in State List during when a national emergency remains in operation. But the law will not remain in force six months after the proclamation ceases to remain in operation.
- Article 252 provides that the Parliament shall have the powers to make a common law on State subjects if two or more States. If the State legislatures request by a resolution the Parliament shall make law on the State subjects applicable to the States. The law can be adopted by any other State later. The power to amend such a law is vested in the Parliament. The State legislatures do not have the power to amend or repeal the law.

• Article 253 confers on the Parliament the power to make law to implement any international treaty, agreement or convention with any other country.

The law enacted by Parliament on a matter in State subject under Article 249 or Article 250 conflicts with a law enacted by the State legislature, the State law shall be inoperative until the Parliament law remains in force.

#### How Supremacy of Union Law Maintained?

According to Article 246, if any question arises as to whether a subject fall within the List 1 or List 2 or Concurrent List, the union law if any enacted will prevail. This is the importance of 'Notwithstanding' clause in Article 246.

# (B) ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS (ARTICLES 256–263)

The administrative relations between Centre and State spans over the power of the union to control the States, delegate certain functions, settlement of disputes and coordination between states.

#### Control of Union over States

In a truly federal system, the idea of the union giving directions to the States is irrelevant. However, the constitution provides for the control of the union over States.

Article 256 expressly makes it an obligation for the States to comply with the law of the Parliament. The State must exercise its executive power in compliance with the laws enacted by the Parliament. Towards this the union government has the powers to issue binding directives to the States.

Article 257 expressly provides that the union government shall have powers to control the States. According to Article 257 (1), the union government has the powers to give directions to the States as to the exercise of their executive powers.

The union government also has the power to give directions towards 'the construction and maintenance of means of communication declared in the direction to be of national or military importance' [Article 257 (2)]. The union government also has the powers to give directions to the State to take measures to protect the railways within the State.

**RA 80** 

#### Specific Agencies For Union Control

- Directions to the State government
- Delegation of union functions
- • All-India Services
- • Grant-in-aid
- Interstate councils
- Interstate Commerce Commission (Article 307)

The Parliament has the power to declare any highway or waterway as national highway or national waterway. Also, the union government has the power to construct and maintain means of communication for naval, military and air force works.

In case of any dispute relating to the expenses incurred by the State in fulfilling the directives between the union and the States it shall be decided by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India.

#### Delegation of Functions

Article 258 provides for the power of the union government to delegate its functions to States. The President has the powers to entrust either conditionally or unconditionally any of the executive functions of the union government. The Parliament may law confer upon the State or its officers' certain functions which may not be part of the subject matter over which the State has powers.

Article 258A confers powers on the State to delegate its functions to union government. The original constitution did not have this provision. It was inserted by the Constitution (70th Amendment) Act, 1956. Article 258a states, 'the Governor of a State may, with the consent of the Government of India, entrust either conditionally or unconditionally to that government or to its officers' functions' relating to the executive powers of the State.

#### Article 258A: Purpose

Article 258A is the provision enabling the Governor of a State to entrust State functions in connection with the execution of certain development projects in the States to the Central government or its officers

Source: Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956.

#### Settlement of Disputes over Interstate River Water and River Valleys

Article 262 provides for the mechanism for the settlement of disputes relating to interstate river water and river valley. The Parliament has powers to enact a law and establish an Interstate river Water Dispute Settlement Tribunal. The law can exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the dispute.

#### *Complexity of the Problem and Adequacy of the Mechanisms*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Constitutional mechanisms to resolve interstate water disputes have failed in its role. Is it due to structural inadequacy or process inadequacy or both? *IAS Mains GS II (2013)*

88 A

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Disputes between the riparian states on sharing of river waters in post-Independence India are becoming increasingly complex. Objectively analyse the major disputes in this connection, with special reference to the southern states. *IAS Mains (2010)*

Interstate river water disputes have been a problem prevalent even before independence. But the problem has in the recent past has become more complex since independence. The increasing complexity of the problem can be attributed to the following reasons:

- The area of the arable lands increased after independence as all the States undertook measures to increase agricultural production. Every State attempt to achieve self-sufficiency in food production.
- The need for water for many States increased due to industrialization also.
- The upper riparian States especially in the peninsular region (Example Karnataka) needed to construct dams and water storage facilities as the water flows down due to the gradient of the land structure.
- The lower riparian States like Tamil Nadu demand their rights over certain rivers like Cauvery based on historical and cultural reasons. Such demands are not accepted by the State like Karnataka.
- The historical and cultural reasons have made the problem to be more taken over by certain local linguistic and regional groups which make the issue a political problem.
- The failure of the government of the union and the States to undertake adequate measures to create drought resistant seed and plant varieties. This could have been a joint venture of various states so that the funding and other resources could have been optimally spent in the mission.
- The State political parties tend to use the interstate water problem as an election issue to garner voter support in the elections. Hence, there have not been honest and genuine moves to resolve the problem. Instead, attempts were made only to keep the issue alive through legal battles.
- Water supplies and irrigation being a State subject and regulation of interstate river water development being a central subject makes it more complex prevents a viable solution.

The constitution provides for Interstate River Water Dispute Settlement Tribunal. Further, Supreme Court also serves as a mechanism to adjudicate relating to the disputes where the tribunal has not been constituted. But the mechanisms suffer from structural and procedural inadequacies:

- 1. There is no permanent mechanism with adequate powers to deal with the interstate river water disputes. Though Article 262 provides for setting up a river water disputes settlement tribunal, it is not a permanent body. It is left to the Parliament to determine whether to set-up one or not.
- 2. The tribunal set-up for the purpose is not vested with enough powers. For instance, when the States did not comply with the tribunal awards, the tribunal does not have powers to force to implement the orders.
- 3. Entry 56 in the Union List vests in the union government the function of 'Regulation and development of interstate rivers and river valleys to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest'. But this is very ambiguous and is left to the Parliament to determine in the public interest.
- 4. The union government in the past has not taken any concrete step to resolve this issue. Though there is a Water Resources Ministry and a National Water Resources Council but their functioning is grossly inadequate in dealing with the interstate river water disputes. The union government has not taken any significant step with respect to evolve a distress sharing arrangement to share waters.
- 5. **River Board:** The River Boards Act, 1956, provides for the establishment of a River Board for the purpose of advising the governments interested in relation to the regulation or development of an interstate river or river valley. But no significant policy measure has been taken in this regard.

# TABLE 20.1 Major Disputes *(Continue)*

# Coordination between States

Towards bringing coordination between the States constitution provides for setting up of interstate council by Article 263. For details please refer the Chapter 25 on the constitutional offices.

# Other Controls

The control of the union over the States also extends in respect of:

- The power to appoint and dismiss the Governor (Articles 155–156).
- Power to appoint other dignitaries in the State, e.g., judges of the court.
- Appointing members of the Joint Public Service Commission (Articles 316) and removal of the members of State Public Service Commission (Articles 317).
- Grating previous sanction to introduce legislation the State legislature (Article 304).
- Assent to specified legislation which must be reserved for his consideration and the veto power in respect of other State Bills reserved by the Governor (Article 200).
- Instruction of President required for the Governor to make ordinance relating to specified matters  $[Article 213(1)].$

# (C) FINANCIAL RELATIONS

The Centre-State financial relations are not in a federal structure and are unitary in nature. The financial powers are distributed more in favour of the union. All the taxes provided in the constitution are levied by the union government. The States do not have the power to levy the taxes referred in the constitution.

# Immunity from Mutual Taxation

Immunity from mutual taxation can prevent redundancy in assessment and calculation and crossaccounting of taxes between the two governments (Union and State). This matter is dealt with in Articles 285 and 289 of our Constitution, relating to the immunity of the Union and a State, respectively.

#### *Immunity of Union Property from State Taxation*

The property of the union shall, save insofar as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by a State or by any authority within a state [Article 285(1)].

#### *Exemption of Property and Income of a State from Union Taxation*

The property of a State is immune from union taxation [Article 289(1)]. The immunity, however, does not extend to all union taxes, as held by our Supreme Court, but is confined only to such taxes as are levied on property. A State is, therefore, not immune from customs duty, which is imposed, not on property, but on the act of import or export of goods.

Not only the 'property' but also the 'income' of a State is exempted from union taxation. The exemption is, however, confined to the State government and does not extend to any local authority situated within a State. The above immunity of the income of a State is, again, subjected to an overriding power of Parliament as regards any income derived from a commercial activity. Thus:

- Ordinarily, the income derived by a State from commercial activities shall be immune from incometax levied by the union.
- Parliament is, however, competent to tax the income of a State derived from a commercial activity.
- If, however, Parliament declares any apparently trading functions as functions 'incidental to the ordinary functions of government', the income from such functions shall be no longer taxable, so long as such declaration stands.

#### Borrowing Powers

The borrowing powers of the Government of Union and of the States are dealt by Articles 292 and 293 respectively. According to Article 292 the union government has the powers to borrow upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India. However, it should be within the limits fixed by the law of Parliament.

The Parliament is empowered to fix the limits of the borrowing powers of the union and fix the limits for the guarantee to given on the Consolidated Fund of India. The union government can borrow both from within India and outside India within the limits and upon the guarantee on the Consolidated Fund.

According to Article 293, the States are allowed to borrow only within the territory of India. That is, the State governments cannot borrow from out of India. The States can borrow upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of the State. The limits of such borrowing are fixed by the law enacted by the State legislature.

The law can also fix the limits for the guarantee to given on the Consolidated Fund of the State. The State governments can borrow only with the consent of the union government, in case the:

- State has already borrowed from the union and the loan is still outstanding or;
- The union government has given a guarantee in respect of a loan raised by the State.
