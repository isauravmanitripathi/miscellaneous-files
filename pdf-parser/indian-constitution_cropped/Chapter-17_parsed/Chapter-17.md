FIGURE 17.1: Indian Judiciary

# THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

The constitution provides for Supreme Court in the Part 4, Chapter IV between Articles 124 and 147. Article 124 (1) establishes the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court comprises the Chief Justice of India and other judges. The constitution sanctions nine judges to the Supreme Court and confers the power to increase the number of judges to the Parliament. Parliament may increase the number of judges from time to time. At present, after enactment of the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2008, the number of judges in the Supreme Court excluding of the Chief Justice (CJ) is 30.

According to Article 130, the seat of the Supreme Court is in Delhi. However, the court may sit in such other place or places, as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) may from time to time, appoint, with the approval of the President.

#### Supreme Court: A Court of Record

Article 129 declares that the Supreme Court is a court of record. According to the Law Dictionary, 'A court of record is a court whose records are admitted to be evidentiary value and are not questioned when they are produced before the court.' The attributes of a court of record are that<sup> $(1)$ </sup>:

- Its judgements and proceedings are enrolled for perpetual memory and testimony. Its record has evidentiary value and cannot be questioned when produced in a court. It is conclusive evidence of what is contained in it.
- A court of record has the power to punish for contempt. Article 129 confers the power to punish for its contempt. According to Contempt of Court Act, there are two types of contempt namely civil contempt and criminal contempt.

Article 142 (2) provides that the Supreme Court has 'all and every power to make any order for the investigation or punishment of any contempt of itself, subjected to the provisions of any law made by Parliament'.

#### Supreme Court History

- Supreme Court in India was first established by the Regulating Act, 1773.
- It was situated in the Fort William, Calcutta.It had the Chief Justice and three other judges.
- Sir Elija Impey was the first Chief Justice.

#### *Contempt of Court*[2]

The Contempt of Court Act, 1971, defines 'civil contempt' as wilful disobedience to any judgement, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.

The law defines 'criminal contempt' as the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which:

- (i) Scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court or;
- (ii) Prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding or;
- (iii) Interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.

# APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES

According to Article 124 (2), the power to appoint the judges of Supreme Court is vested in the President. A judge of Supreme Court is appointed by the President by a warrant under his hand and seal. The President, in appointing the judges has to consult 'such of the judges of the Supreme Court and of the high courts in the States as the President may deem necessary'.<sup>[3]</sup>

# Issues Involved in the Appointment of Judges

There are two important issues in relation to the appointment of the judges of Supreme Court namely:

- 1. Appointment of Chief Justice of India
- 2. Appointment of other judges.

# *Appointment of Chief Justice of India*

The senior most judge of the Supreme Court by age is appointed as the Chief Justice of India. This is followed as a convention since the commencement of the constitution. However, in 1956 the Law Commission in its report was critical of this practice and recommended that seniority should not the criterion and 'the experience of the person as a judge, his administrative competence and merit', must be considered for the appointment of the Chief Justice. However, the government rejected this recommendation and the practice of appointing the senior most judge of Supreme Court as Chief Justice was continued.

Memorandum of Procedure: Appointment of Chief Justice

- Senior most judge of Supreme Court considered fit to hold the office.
- • Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs seeks recommendation of outgoing CJI.
- In case of any doubt about the fitness of the senior most judge to hold the office of the CJI other judges as envisaged in Article 124 (2) are consulted.
- On recommendation of CJI, the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Company Affairs puts up the recommendation to Prime Minister.
- Then Prime Minister advises the President for making the appointment.

In 1973, the government accepted the recommendation retrospectively and appointed Justice A. N. Ray as the Chief Justice, superseding three senior judges. However, the government justified its stand stating that Article 124 confers discretion on the President to appoint the Chief Justice. In the first 22

**RA 80** 

<sup>3</sup> Article 124: Since the Supreme Court struck down the Constitution 99th Amendment relating to the constitution of National Judicial Appointments Commission, the condition before the amendment is restored.

years of the commencement of the constitution the President had chosen not exercise the discretion. However, this reasoning was deplored by the constitutional experts on the following grounds:

- The principle of seniority followed in the appointment of the Chief Justice, was not a mere practice but had been an established convention as it was followed for 22 years.
- The Law Commission recommended for considering the merit of the judge but the merit is not in the view of the executive. The supersession of the three senior judges was not on the reason of their merit determined by the Law Commission. They were superseded, for they had decided the Keshavananda Bharti case against the will of the government.
- It was argued the social philosophy of the judges must be taken into account while appointing the judges.[4] This means the judges must be subscribing to the view of the executive. This would be a kind of spoils system which would amount to packing of judiciary.

The event of superseding the judges had been viewed as a blow on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. It has thus, made it essential to establish the method for the appointment of the Chief Justice. After the general elections 1977, the Janata Party came to power. The Janata Party was against the supersession of the judges and once coming to power the party revived the practice of appointing the senior most judge of the Supreme Court as Chief Justice. Hence, the practice of appointing the senior most judge as Chief Justice was restored.

#### *Appointment of Other Judges*

Another important issue relating is to the appointment of other judges. Article 124 lays down that the President 'shall consult the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the high courts in the States as the President may deem necessary'. In case of the appointment of a judge other than the Chief Justice 'the Chief Justice shall always be consulted' [Article 124(2)].

The term 'consult' in Article 124 became the bone of contention between the executive and the judiciary. In 1977, in the Sankalchand Seth case, the Supreme Court ruled that the President has to consult the constitutional functionaries, but the advice was not binding on the President. The President can differ with the opinion of the constitutional functionaries and take contrary view.

Later, in 1982 in the S. P. Gupta versus Union of India case (Judges Transfer Case), the Supreme Court unanimously agreed with the Sankalchand view and ruled that the consultation is not binding on the President. It implies that the power of appointing the judges is the sole prerogative of the Union government. However, it was also observed that this view would have an adverse impact on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.

In 1993, in the SCARA versus Union of India case, the Supreme Court overruled the Sankalchand Seth case judgement. The court held that the Chief Justice must have supremacy in matters of the appointment of judges.

#### **Connect**

#### Article 124

- Sankalchand Seth case, consultation is mandatory but not binding.
- • S. P. Gupta versus Union of India case, consultation is not binding.SCARA versus Union of India case, supremacy of CJI in appointment of judges.
- • President reference, 1998 consultation is 'concurrence'.

In 1998, the President referred to the Supreme Court, nine issues relating to the appointment of Supreme Court judges and transfer of high court Judges for its opinion exercising his power under Article 143. The President sought clarification on the consultation process relating to judge's appointment and transfer. The court ruled as follows:

- 1. The President has to consult the Chief Justice while appointing a judge of Supreme Court and the consultation is binding. That is, consultation means 'concurrence' of the Chief Justice.
- 2. The consultation process requires 'consultation of plurality of judges'. The sole opinion of the CJI does not constitute the 'consultation' process.
- 3. Therefore, the Chief Justice of India should consult a collegium of four senior most judges of the Supreme Court before giving his opinion. The CJI should not send the recommendation to the government, even if two judges give an adverse opinion.
- 4. 'The collegium should make the decision in consensus and unless the opinion of the collegium is in conformity with that of the Chief Justice of India, no recommendation is to be made'.
- 5. Regarding the transfer of high court judges, in addition to the collegium of four senior most judges, the Chief Justice of India was obliged to consult the Chief Justice of the two high courts (one from which the judge was transferred and the other receiving him).
- 6. In regard to the appointment of high court judges, the CJI was required to consult only two seniors most judges of the apex court.
- 7. The transfer of puisne judges of the high courts was judicially reviewable, only if the CJI had recommended the transfers without consulting four senior most judges of the apex court and two Chief Justices of the high courts concerned.
- 8. The requirement of consultation by the CJI with his colleagues does not exclude consultation with those judges who are conversant with the affairs of the high court concerned—either as a parent court (the high court from where the transfer is made) or who have occupied the office of a judge or Chief Justice of that court on transfer from his parent high court or any other court.
- 9. Strong and cogent reasons must exist regarding a person's name not being recommended. Only positive reasons may be given. The views of the other judges consulted by the CJI should be in writing and the same should be conveyed to the government, along with the recommendation by the CJI (Judgment dated 28 October 1998).<sup>[5]</sup>

#### Do You Know?

- • Within the Supreme Court is the 'Judges' Library'.
- It was established in 1937.
- Then it was known as 'Federal Court Library'.
- • Judges, senior advocates, officers of the registry and law clerks attached to judges are permitted to use the library.

# Need for National Judicial Commission (NJC)

As a consequence of the issues discussed in respect of the appointment of judges, the demand for setting up of a National Judicial Commission was raised. The demand was made on the following grounds:

Firstly, the appointment of judges of Supreme Court and the transfer of the judges of high courts had become a bone of contention between the executive and judiciary. Both try to acquire supremacy of one over the other. This cannot be granted in a democratic welfare state.

Secondly, to uphold the constitution, its values and to guarantee good governance to the citizens, it is essential to keep the judiciary out of such controversies. Otherwise, the very purpose of the constitution will be defeated.

...

<sup>5 11</sup>th Presidential Reference to Supreme Court 1998.

Thirdly, democracy requires effective participatory of both the executive and judiciary playing their respective roles rather than contending for power. Hence, the need for judicial commission arose.

Fourthly, the present system of appointments and transfer of judges is not transparent. According to Justice Krishna Iyer, the present system of collegium is 'often dilatory, arbitrary and smeared by favouritism'.

Fifthly, there is a need for independent mechanism for the ensuring the accountability of the judges and ensuring ethical conduct of the judges.

#### NJC, View of NCRWC

- National Commission to review the working of the constitution first recommended for the setting up of the National Judicial Commission
- The National Judicial Commission for appointment of judges of the Supreme Court shall comprise of:
  - (a) The Chief Justice of India: Chairman
  - (b) Two senior most judges of the Supreme Court: Member
  - (c) The Union Minister for Law and Justice : Member
  - (d) One eminent person nominated by the President after consulting the Chief Justice of India: Member
- A committee comprising the CJI and two senior most judges of the Supreme Court will comprise the committee of NJC to examine complaints of deviant behaviour and complaints of misbehaviour and incapacity against judges of Supreme Court and high courts.

### National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)

The NJAC was established by the constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014. The act amended Articles 124,127, 128, 217, 222, 224 and 231. It inserted Articles 124A, 124B, 124C and 224A.

Article 124 was amended to make it mandatory for the President to consult the NJAC for the appointment of the judges of the Supreme Court. The amendment deleted the controversial phrase, 'Provided that in the case of appointment of a judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted'.

Article 124A established the NJAC. The NJAC shall consist of:

- The Chief Justice of India as the *ex officio* Chairperson.
- Two other senior judges of the Supreme Court next to the Chief Justice of India as *ex officio* members.

#### Do You Know?

- • Law Commission 121st Report (1987), recommended establishing National Judicial Service Commission with CJI as Chairman, three senior most judges of the Supreme Court, three senior most CJs of high courts, the Minister for Law and Justice, the Attorney General, outgoing CJI and a legal academic as members.
- • Constitution (67th Amendment) Bill, 1990: First bill moved to establish a National Judicial Commission.
- National Advisory Council, recommended for a seven member NJC with Vice-President as Chairman and PM, Speaker of Lok Sabha, Law Minister, Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and CJI.

- The Union Minister in-charge of law and justice as *ex officio* member.
- Two eminent persons to be nominated by the committee consisting of the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India and the Leader of Opposition in the House of the People or where there is no such Leader of Opposition, then, the leader of single largest opposition party in the House of the People as members.

One of the eminent persons nominated for membership in NJAC must be a person belonging to the Scheduled Caste, the Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minorities or women. Such an eminent person shall be nominated for a period of three years and shall not be eligible for re-nomination.

Article 124B laid down the duties of the National Judicial Appointments Commission to:

- (a) Recommend persons for appointment as Chief Justice of India, judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justices of high courts and other judges of high courts.
- (b) Recommend transfer of Chief Justice and other judges of high courts from one high court to any other high court.
- (c) Ensure that the person recommended is of ability and integrity.

The constitutional validity of 99th amendment was challenged by the Supreme Court Advocates on Records Association. The Supreme Court struck down the amendment as unconstitutional and so void on the following grounds:

- Article 124A (1) does not provide an adequate representation, to the judicial component in the NJAC.
- Article 124A (1) is insufficient to preserve the primacy of the judiciary, in the matter of selection and appointment of judges, to the higher judiciary (as also transfer of Chief Justices and judges, from one high court to another).
- Judicial appointments and the primacy judiciary in judicial appointments (with executive participation) is part of the basic features of the constitution which cannot be taken away by any amendment.
- The Clause (c) of Article 124 A (1) is *ultra vires* the provisions of the constitution, because of the inclusion of the Union Minister is in-charge of Law and Justice as an *ex officio* member of the NJAC and is violative of the principle of 'independence of the judiciary'.
- According to Article 124C, empowers the Parliament to amend the powers governing the NJAC through the ordinary law-making process. This is a clear violation the theory of the separation of powers. 'It basically gives the legislative pillar massive powers, which can lead to an elected dictatorship by Parliament and ultimately the suppression of democracy.' $(6)$

# NJAC Judgement: A Review

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Critically examine the Supreme Court's judgment on 'National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014' with reference to appointment of judges of higher judiciary in India.

*IAS MAINS GS PAPER 2 (2017)*

Although it is well in the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review any law and declare it unconstitutional if the law conflicts with the constitution, the judgement relating to the NJAC needs a closer and critical analysis.

The judgement has not in any way settled the issue of appointing the judges of Supreme Court and high courts. The collegium system which is presently followed was created by the court and is no way constitutional. The court has also agreed upon this. In the judgement against the NJAC the judges have expressly stated that the collegium system is not free of flaws.

<sup>6</sup> Supreme Court: NJAC case judgment.

#### National Advisory Council View

- Unaccountable nature of the appointment process of judges.
- • Appointment suffers from caste, communal and political considerations, especially in high courts.
- Appointment, not to open to public scrutiny makes determining criteria for appointment difficult.
- Seniority is used as a proxy to merit.

The system is in complete violation of the 'separation of powers'. It has resulted in the condition of judges appointing judges. It is argued that this arrangement is needed for maintaining the independence of the judiciary. However, it is essential to ensure that no organ of the democracy possesses absolute power. The collegium system makes the judiciary absolutely powerful in the appointment of judges.

Moreover, appointment of judges by the NJAC will increase the 'public confidence' on judiciary and retains the 'checks and balances'. After all the independence of the judiciary also needs to balanced. In this context the views expressed by Justice Chalameshwar, who gave a dissenting judgement in the case needs to noted. The most important points of his judgement favouring the NJAC are as follows:

- 1. 'Transparency is a vital factor in constitutional governance.... Transparency is an aspect of rationality. The need for transparency is more in the case of appointment process. Proceedings of the collegium were absolutely opaque and inaccessible both to public and history, barring occasional leaks.'
- 2. Assumption that 'primacy of the judiciary' in the appointment of judges is a basic feature of Constitution 'is empirically flawed.'
- 3. There were cases where the apex court collegium 'retraced its steps' after rejecting recommendations of a particular name suggested by the high court collegium giving scope for a great deal of 'speculation'. 'There is no accountability in this regard. The records are absolutely beyond the reach of any person including the judges of the Supreme Court who are not lucky enough to become the Chief Justice of India. Such a state of affairs does not either enhance the credibility of the institution or good for the people of this country.
- 4. 'To hold that government should be totally excluded from the process of appointing judges would be wholly illogical and inconsistent with the foundations of the theory of democracy and a doctrinal heresy,' because the exclusion of the executive branch is destructive of the basic feature of checks and balances, a fundamental principle in constitutional theory.

From the foregoing one can clearly conclude that the judgement has instead of resolving the conflict has only aggravated. Furthermore, it is essential to note that the judiciary being dragged into such controversies would result the loss of public confidence in the judiciary and democracy in the long run.

# All India Judicial Service (AIJS): Arguments 'For' and 'Against'

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Present your views for and against the creation of an All India Judicial Service.

*IAS MAINS GS (1997)*

Article 312 which provide for the procedure for creating a new All India Service, expressly mentions the need for the creation of the All India Judicial Service. It also provides that 'the All India Judicial Service shall not include any post inferior to that of a district judge as defined in Article 236'. There have been arguments 'for' and 'against' the creation of All India Judicial Service.

#### *Arguments 'For'*

The first Law Commission recommended for the creation to the All India Judicial Service on the ground of bringing efficiency to the judiciary.

According to the former Chief Justice of India Sikri, the conditions of the subordinate judiciary were poor and the creation of All India Judicial Service would improve the conditions of service of subordinate judiciary.

The Supreme Court in the Judges case (1992) observed that, 'it is in the interest of the health of the judiciary throughout the country that this should be done'. The court viewed that the presence of All India Judicial Service could resolve the contention in the appointment of judges.

The National Judicial Pay Commission, based on the opinion elicited for the high courts, recommended that the All India Judicial Service should be constituted only in the cadre of district judges.

The All India Judicial Service also will have the advantage being a unifying factor and enable the nation-building activity.

Similarly, like the other All India Judicial Services, this will also help in evolving uniformity throughout India with respect to the judicial administration.

#### *Arguments 'Against'*

There have been equally strong arguments against the creation of All India Judicial Service.

Officers recruited through the All India Judicial Service at the national level may suffer from inadequate knowledge of regional language. This would affect their ability to understand the arguments placed in the trial and would corrode judicial efficiency.

The high court may lose its control over the subordinate judiciary which would impair the independence of the judiciary.

Article 312, after the 42nd Amendment Act, the All India Judicial Service shall not include any post inferior to that of a 'district judge' as defined in Article 236. If the All India Judicial Service is to 'induct bright and young persons' to the service, then such persons have to take charge as district judges after selection and training.' District judges not only try serious criminal cases but also exercise appellate jurisdiction in both criminal and civil matters. They also exercise original jurisdiction in certain civil matters.' It might be counterproductive.

An intelligent and competent lawyer would be able to establish himself in his profession by his 35–40 years of age. Such a lawyer may not be inclined to join the service as he may be allotted to State cadres and would be transferred frequently.<sup>[7]</sup>

When a young person selected to All India Judicial Service is appointed as a District Judge, he becomes eligible for being appointed as a judge of High Court on completion of 15 years of his service as a District Judge. For instance, if such a person enters All India Judicial Service by his 24 years, he will be considered for being appointed as a judge of High Court in about 40 years. This is too young an age for being appointed as a judge of High Court.

#### All India Judicial Service

- 1st, 8th and 116th reports of Law Commission recommended.
- Parliamentary Standing Committee on law and justice 15th report recommended
- First National Judicial Pay Commission (1999) recommended.
- • National Advisory Council to the Centre also reiterated the recommendation.
- • Supreme Court in Judges c All India Judicial Service case (1992) endorsed the creation of an AIJS.

**...** 

<sup>7</sup> The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, Consultation Paper on All India Judicial Service, 200.
### QUALIFICATION OF JUDGES

According to Article 124 (3), a person is qualified to be appointed as a judge of Supreme Court only if he:

- (a) Is a citizen of India
- (b) Has been for at least five years a judge of a high court or of two or more such courts in succession or;
- (c) Has been for at least ten years an advocate of a high court or two or more such courts in succession or;
- (d) Is, in the opinion of the President, a distinguished jurist.

## TERM OF OFFICE

The constitution does not prescribe any fixed term of office for the judges. Once appointed, a judge holds office 'until he attains the age of 65 years'. However, a judge of Supreme Court can resign his office by writing under his hand addressed to the President.

# Removal of the Judge of Supreme Court

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

How can a judge of Supreme Court be removed? *IAS MAINS GS (2004)* 

A judge of Supreme Court is removed by the process of impeachment. Article 124 and the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968, provide for the procedure:

- 1. A judge of Supreme Court can be removed only on the ground of 'proved misbehaviour' or 'incapacity'.
- 2. A motion to remove a judge, addressed to the President must be submitted to the Speaker of Lok Sabha or Chairman of Rajya Sabha. The motion has to be signed by at least 100 members of Lok Sabha or 50 members of Rajya Sabha.
- 3. On the receipt of the motion a three member committee comprised of two judges of Supreme Court and one distinguished jurist is constituted to investigate the charges.
- 4. If the report of the committee contains a finding that the judge is guilty of any misbehaviour or suffers from any incapacity, then, the motion together with the report of the committee, shall be taken up for consideration by the House or the Houses of Parliament.
- 5. If the motion is passed by a majority of total membership of the House and by a majority of twothirds of the members of that House present and voting, then the motion shall be presented to the President.
- 6. On receipt of the resolution, the President passes the order removing the judge.

# In-House Disciplinary Mechanism

The constitution provides only for the removal of the judges of Supreme Court and high courts on specific grounds of 'proved misbehaviour' and 'incapacity'. However, the removal by impeachment would an extreme remedy if there was any other misconduct or deviant behaviour. There must be a penalty other than removal in such cases. There must also be a procedure and a mechanism to deal with such matters at an appropriate level. Such mechanism needs to be one that will not affect the independence of the judiciary. The Supreme Court evolved such a mechanism in 1997.

If the Chief Justice of a high court receives a complaint against a judge of the high court, then he initiates a probe if he is satisfied that there might substance in the allegations placed against the judge. Then, the Chief Justice of the high court can conduct an inquiry and get the explanation from the judge. If, out of the inquiry, he is satisfied that the allegations do not contain any substance, then he closes the inquiry. However, if he is satisfied that the allegations contain substance, then he may prescribe penalty as he may think fit.

#### Proved Misbehaviour Uncertainty of Meaning: NCRWC View

Do the following amount to 'misbehaviour' within the meaning of Article 124 (4)?

- • Whether not observing the court hours or;Whether holding the court at one's own pleasure or;Whether not delivering judgments for years together.
- • Whether reserving judgments for years together and leaving them un-disposed of till their retirement or transfer.

In case, the Chief Justice is of the opinion that the allegations need a deeper probe then he can forward the complaint, the response of the judge concerned along with his opinion to the Chief Justice of India.

If the Chief Justice of India is satisfied that the matter requires further inquiry, he will constitute a three member panel to conduct the inquiry in accordance with the Judges (Inquiries) Act. The judge facing the allegations is entitled to appear before the committee and place his explanations. The inquiry will not be a formal one involving examination or cross-examination of evidences and witnesses.

After the inquiry, the committee may submit a report to the Chief Justice of India that:

- There is no substance in the allegations contained in the complaint, in that case the allegation is dropped or;
- There is sufficient substance in the allegations but the misconduct disclosed is not of serious nature to call for initiating the procedure for the removal of the judge or;
- There is sufficient substance in the allegations that the misconduct disclosed is so serious that the procedure for removing the judge must be initiated. In that case the Chief Justice of India will convey the report to the Parliament and will request the Parliament to initiate the procedure for the removal of the judge.

The same procedure is adopted in case of the judges of Supreme Court also. The in-house mechanism was instituted on the recommendation of Justice Aggarwal Committee in 1997. Since, then the debate on the judicial accountability and the independence has been alive. While the independence of the judiciary is paramount, the accountability of the judiciary is also equally important. This has resulted in the demand for a permanent mechanism to deal with this matter. In the post 1991, era of transparency and accountability the demand had gained momentum and a Judicial Accountability Bill was introduced in 2006. However, the bill was not passed and lapsed. Later, the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, 2010 was introduced in the Lok Sabha and passed. But the bill lapsed due to the dissolution of the House.

## Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill

The bill replaces the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 and provides for:

- Establishing judicial standards that can be enforced to regulate the conduct of judges of high courts and the Supreme Court.
- Replace the present in-house mechanism for investigating the allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity of judges of high courts and the Supreme Court with a statutory body.
- Amend the process for removing the judges of Supreme Court and the high courts.
- Disciplinary proceedings against judges for minor cases.
- The declaration of assets by the judges. A judge must furnish the information relating to the assets and liabilities within thirty days from the date on which he makes and subscribes an oath or affirmation.

**RA 80** 

### What are 'Judicial Standards'?

- 1. Norms, including:
  - Punctuality and commitment to work
  - Having integrity and detachment
  - Impartial administration of justice.
- 2. Being conscious that he is under the public gaze.Not doing any act or omission which is unbecoming of the high office.
- 3. Maintaining a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his office.
- 4. Judgments should speak for themselves.

Source: The Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill, 2012.

Ethics in judiciary is prescribed by the 'Restatement of values of Judicial Life' adopted by the Supreme Court in 1997. The Judicial Standards Bill, 2010, incorporates most of the provisions in the statement. The bill prescribes to judges 'universally accepted values of judicial life and requires them to follow certain standards of conduct. The bill prohibits a judge:

- From contesting the election to any office of a club, society or other association except one connected with law or any court.
- Having close association with individual members of the Bar particularly with those who practice in the same court in which he is a judge.
- From allowing family members who are members of the Bar to use his official residence for professional work or to appear before him or associated in any manner with a cause to be dealt with by him.
- To hear and decide a matter in which a member of his family, or his close relative or a friend is concerned.
- From entering into public debate or express his views in public on political matters or on matters which are pending or are likely to arise for judicial determination by him.
- From giving interview to the media in relation to any of his judgment delivered, or order made, or direction issued, by him, in any case adjudicated by him.
- From engaging in trade or business, either by himself or in association with any other person, directly or indirectly.

Further, to investigate complaints against judges, the bill provides for the establishment of:

- National Judicial Oversight Committee
- Scrutiny Panel
- Investigation Committee

## *National Judicial Oversight Committee*

The committee is comprised of a retired Chief Justice of India as the Chairperson, a judge of the Supreme Court, a Chief Justice of the high court, the Attorney General for India, and an eminent person appointed by the President as members.

Any person making an allegation of misbehaviour or incapacity in respect of a judge may file a complaint with the committee. The committee is vested with supervisory powers on investigation into complaints against judges, and the power to impose minor measures.

#### Independent Judiciary Need

An independent judiciary is needed:To protect and preserve rule of law

- To ensure supremacy of the constitution and law
- To quarantee the rights of the individuals
- To settle disputes between individuals, groups and government

# Position of Supreme Court

Under the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court enjoys the position as, a federal court, guardian of constitution, guarantor of fundamental rights, highest interpreter of the constitution and the apex court.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What is the position of Supreme Court under the Constitution of India? How far does it play its role as the guardian of the constitution? *IAS MAINS GS (2002)*

### *(a) Federal Court*

The Supreme Court in its original jurisdiction under Article 131 acts as a federal court. A federal court is a court that deals with the disputes between the federating units. In India, the Supreme Court is the only court that has the power to entertain the petitions relating to the dispute between union and State governments or any dispute between the States.

Article 131 provide that the Supreme 'shall have original jurisdiction in any dispute between:

- The Government of India and one or more States or;
- The Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other or;
- Two or more States, if and in so far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends.'

### *(b) Guardian of the Constitution*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What is the position of the Supreme Court under the Constitution of India? How far does it play its role as the guardian of the constitution? *IAS MAINS (2002)*

The founding fathers have entrusted the responsibility of guarding the constitution with the Supreme Court. Being the guardian of the constitution, the Supreme Court seeks to:

- Protect and preserve the constitution from undue encroachment.
- Prevent the abuse of the powers conferred on the legislature and executive.
- Uphold the values and philosophy of the constitution.
- Interpret the constitution to clarify and ensure that the objectives of the constitution are achieved.
- Guarantee the fundamental rights.

The Supreme Court in various cases, by the power of judicial review has been performing its role as the guardian of the constitution judicially. The court has prevented the undue encroachment of the constitution in several occasions by declaring such amendments to the constitution void. For instance, the court in the Keshavananda Bharti case propounded the Doctrine of Basic Structure, which has effectively prevented the legislature from making any law that may take away certain features of the constitution which would amount to substitute the constitution with a new one. Thus, the constituent power of the Parliament is limited only to enable the constitution to keep pace with the changing needs of the time but not to replace the constitution.

The court has effectively prevented the abuse of the power vested in the Parliament and the executive. For example, the court had effectively prevented the power to proclaim constitutional emergency in any State. Since 1958, when it was first used against the E. M. S. Namboodhiripad Government in Kerala, the power had been subjected to misuse in several occasions. After the S. R. Bommai case judgment, this has been effectively prevented from being misused. The court has restored the State governments whenever the emergency was proclaimed on political reasons. The restoration of the Arunachal Pradesh government in 2016 is a glaring example.

The court has ensured that the philosophy of the constitution as enshrined in the Preamble is represented in all the actions of the State and its apparatus. The court's judgement regarding secularism, social justice and sovereignty are worth noting here.

Similarly, the court has in various judgements has ensured that the constitutional objectives are upheld in the State actions. The court, by interpreting the right to life guaranteed by Article 21, as the right to 'live with human dignity', has clarified that the objective of the constitution is to secure dignity of individuals. This has given way for the emergence of the concept of 'Implied Rights'.

In the Minerva Mills case, the court clarified that the fundamental rights and the DPSP together constitute the 'conscience of the constitution' and there is no inherent conflict between the two. The court by evolving the 'Doctrine of Harmonious Construction' gave the means to resolve any apparent conflict between any two provisions of the constitution.

Further, the court also has played its role as the guarantor of the fundamental rights. Since upholding the fundamental rights is an essential function of the court, enforcement of the rights may also be included in its role as the guardian of the constitution.

## *(c) Guarantor of Fundamental Rights*

The Constitution of India provides for enumerated and guaranteed fundamental rights. Keeping in mind the low rate of literacy and the low level of political socialization in the India, the founding fathers of the constitution chose to have the guaranteed fundamental rights. The responsibility of enforcing the rights is vested in the Supreme Court by Article 32. The Supreme Court has been playing this role effectively. The following instance may be quoted as examples:

- In the Mandal Commission case, the Court had upheld reservation as constitutional and protected the right of the weaker sections.
- In the Maneka Gandhi case, the Court has clearly established the relationship between Articles 19 and 21. The Court ruled that the Articles 19 and 21 are not watertight compartments but are closely related. The right to personal liberties guaranteed by Article 21 include the rights guaranteed by Article 19. The court interpreted 'procedure established by law' as 'due process'. So, any action by the State to deprive the right to personal liberties is subjected to test of reasonableness.
- Further, the interpretation of the fundamental rights by the Court has evolved the concept of 'Implied Rights'. This has resulted in the rise of many rights such as right to shelter, right to pollution-free environment, etc.
- The court has come out with the guidelines to be followed by the Police while detaining any person in the D. K. Basu case. This has established a deterrent against the violation of Human Rights.
- With respect to Child Labour, in the M. C. Mehta case, the court directed the setting up of the Child Labour Relief Fund for the rehabilitation of the Child Labour. Thus, protecting the Child Rights.
- The court in the Reverend Father Stanislas case, the court clarified the 'freedom of conscience' and the right to propagate.
- With respect to the constitutional remedies the court has provided the guidelines for the issuing the writs. The court had ruled that the court must not refuse to grant relief on certain grounds.<sup>[9]</sup>

Thus, the court has played its role as the guarantor of fundamental rights.

# *(d) Highest Interpreter of the Constitution*

Article 147, vests the power to interpret the constitutional provisions involving 'any substantial question of law'. Any interpretation made by the court to any provision of the constitution is binding on all the courts within the territory of India. Only the Supreme Court or the legislature (Parliament or the state legislature) is empowered to overrule the ruling of the court. For example, the court had propounded the Doctrine of Basic Feature in the Kesavananda Bharti case, which has now come to stay since 1973.

The Supreme Court in the interpretation of provisions of the constitution has evolved various doctrines. The most notable doctrines are:

- Doctrine of Prospective Overruling
- Doctrine of Progressive Interpretation

**RA 80** 

<sup>9</sup> For details refer the Fundamental Rights.

- Doctrine of Eclipse
- Doctrine of Severability
- Doctrine of Natural Justice
- Doctrine of Liberal Interpretation
- Doctrine of Public Trust
- Doctrine of Pith and Substance
- Doctrine of Territorial Nexus
- Doctrine of Harmonious Construction

**Doctrine of Prospective Overruling:** It means that any interpretation given to any provision of the constitution or any law declared by the Supreme Court shall not be given a retrospective application. It shall only have a prospective value and be applied only to cases arising after the ruling of the court. For instance, the concept of basic feature propounded by the Supreme Court is applicable only to cases after 1 April 1973 and will not be applicable to cases before that date.

#### Do You Know?

- Doctrine of Prospective overruling first originated in the USA.
- • In India the doctrine was invoked in the Golaknath case by the CJI Subba Rao

#### Objections against the Doctrine

- 1. It amounts to legislation by courts.
- 2. It would not encourage parties to prefer appeals as they would not get any benefit.
- 3. Declaration for the future would only be obiter and is not a desirable change.
- 4. It is a brake on courts which otherwise might be tempted to be so fascile in overruling.

**Doctrine of Progressive Interpretation:** In case there are two interpretations to any provision of the constitution or law one progressive and the other regressive, the courts shall take the progressive meaning in to consideration and let the other go. The courts are expected to contribute to the progress of the society in a welfare state.

**Doctrine of Eclipse:** The doctrine is related to Article 13 (1). Article 13 (1) provides that any law enacted before the commencement and in force at the commencement of the constitution is void if it is 'inconsistent with or in derogation' of fundamental rights. 'Doctrine of Eclipse is based on the premise that fundamental rights are prospective in nature'.<sup>[10]</sup>

As a consequence, 'an existing law inconsistent with a fundamental right, though it becomes inoperative from the date of commencement of the Constitution, is not dead altogether. $(11)$  The law is said to be eclipsed by the fundamental rights. In case, any amendment is made to the fundamental rights then the law will come into force.

**Doctrine of Severability:** The doctrine is also related to Article 13. According to Article 13, any law 'inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights shall be void to the extent of such incon-

sistency shall be void'. If any part of a law is infringing upon the fundamental rights, then only such part shall be void. Whereas if the rest other parts of the law are consistent with the rights and can survive without the impugned part then it shall remain in force.

| <b>Natural Justice: Constitutional Provisions</b> |                 |                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| (a) Preamble                                      | (d) Article 21  | $(g)$ Article 136 |

| (c) Article 14                                    | (f) Article 39A | $(i)$ Article 311 |

**Doctrine of Natural Justice**<sup>[12]</sup>: The doctrine is termed as a synonym of fairness in the concept of justice and stands as the most accepted methodology of a governmental action. The doctrine is to check the arbitrary exercise of power by the State. It is not only to secure justice but also to prevent miscarriage of injustice because the underlying objective of the principle of natural justice is to ensure fundamental rights of the citizens are guaranteed.

**Doctrine of Liberal Interpretation:** The doctrine means that the court must be liberal in interpreting the provisions of the constitution. Every provision must be construed as to give meaning and relevance to every word used. The provision must be interpreted in widest possible terms that the widest meaning must be taken. The Supreme Court refused the plea in A. K. Gopalan case but has accepted in the Maneka Gandhi case.

**Doctrine of Public Trust:** The Supreme Court has enunciated the doctrine of 'Public Trust', M.C. Mehta versus Kamal Nath (1997) case. The idea of this theory was that certain common properties such as rivers, seashores, forests and the air were held by the government in trusteeship for the free and unimpeded use of the general public.

The resources like air, sea, waters and the forests have such a great importance to the people as a whole, that it would be totally unjustified to make them a subject of private ownership. The concept 'environment' bears a very close relationship to this doctrine. The doctrine enjoins upon the resources for the enjoyment of the general public, rather to permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes.

**Doctrine of Pith and Substance:** The doctrine corresponds to Article 246. According to Article 246, the Parliament has exclusive powers to make law on matters in Union List and the state legislatures exclusive powers to make law on matters in State List, respectively. Thus, any encroachment on each other's powers is not permitted by the constitution. For example, if any law made by the Parliament is encroaching upon a matter in State List, then the court will apply this doctrine to determine the validity of the law. In case the encroachment is eventual and not intentional then the court may declare the law as valid.

In case the court finds that the encroachment was deliberate and intentional, then the court will declare the law as unconstitutional. The law is known as 'colourable legislation'. The Parliament is utilizing a matter in Union List to take the chance of legislating on the State List and hence unconstitutional.

#### Doctrine of Public Trust

Supreme Court applied the Doctrine of Public Trust in Spectrum 2G case and cancelled the 122 licenses allotted and observed that:

- Natural resources belong to the people but the State legally owns them on behalf of its people and from that point of view natural resources are considered as national assets, more so because the State benefits immensely from their value.
- The State is empowered to distribute natural resources. However, as they constitute public property/national asset, while distributing natural resources, the State is bound to act in consonance with the principles of equality and public trust and ensure that no action is taken which may be detrimental to public interest.
- • In Article 39(b) of the Constitution it has been provided that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community should be so distributed so as to best sub-serve the common good.

**Doctrine of Territorial Nexus:** It is corresponding to Article 245. The doctrine limits the applicability of a State law to the territory of the State. It shall be applied only to persons within the State. However, it will be applicable persons and objects outside the State if there is a direct nexus between the State making the law and the purpose of the law. In effect the doctrine means the State laws will not have validity out of the territorial limits of the law. According to Article 245, only the law enacted by the Parliament will have extraterritorial jurisdiction.

**Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:** When two provisions of the constitution appear to conflict with each other, the meaning of such provisions which gives effect to both the provisions ensuring smooth and harmonious operation of both the provisions should be accepted. The doctrine was applied in the Minerva Mills case.

# *(e) Apex Court*

The Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority in India. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is the Chief Justice of India. According to Article 141, 'the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India'. Thus, the Supreme Court plays the role of an apex court.

# JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT

Under the Indian constitution, jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be classified as five types namely:

- (i) Original jurisdiction
- (ii) Appellate jurisdiction
- (iii) Writ jurisdiction
- (iv) Advisory jurisdiction
- (v) Revisory jurisdiction

However, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be enlarged in accordance with Article 138. Article 138 provides that the Parliament can enlarge the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by conferring powers and jurisdiction with respect to the matters in the Union List in Schedule 7. Further, the Parliament can confer upon the Supreme Court, such powers and jurisdiction in accordance with any international or bilateral agreements to which India is signatory.
# (a) Original Jurisdiction

Article 131 defines the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In its original jurisdiction the Supreme Court is a federal court. In its original jurisdiction:

- The Supreme Court has 'exclusive' power to inquire into any question of law or fact relating to 'the existence or extent of a legal right' of or any dispute in that regard between:
  - (a) The Government of India and one or more States or:
  - (b) The Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other States on the other or;
  - (c) Two or more States.
  - These are known as the 'original suits' filed in the Court.
- According to Article 32, the Supreme Court has the original jurisdiction for the enforcement of fundamental rights.
- According to Article 139A (1), inserted by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, empowers the Supreme Court to transfer certain cases pending in the Supreme Court or any high court, if the case involves 'any substantial question of general importance'. The court can withdraw case either on its own, or if the Attorney General makes an application regarding this.
- According to Article 139A (2), inserted by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 'the Supreme Court may, if it deems it expedient so to do for the ends of justice, transfer any case, appeal or other proceedings pending before any high court to any other high court'.

# *Exemption to Original Jurisdiction*

There are certain cases which are exempted from the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Such exemptions are as follows:

#### 1. **Articles 131 and 363**

The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court will not extend over any 'dispute arising out of any treaty, agreement, covenant, engagement, *sanad* or other similar instrument which, having been entered into or executed before the commencement of this constitution, continues in operation after such commencement, or which provides that the said jurisdiction shall not extend to such a dispute', even the dispute is between the federating units.

### 2. **Article 257 (4)**

Any dispute relating to the sharing of 'the extra cost incurred in the construction or maintenance of any means of communication or the measures to be taken for the protection of any railway by any State on the direction by the union government'. Any default of in this regard shall be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India.

### 3. **Article 258 (4)**

Any dispute relating to the sharing of the costs with respect to the powers conferred or functions delegated to any State shall be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India.

### 4. **Article 262**

In case of any interstate river water dispute, the Parliament is empowered to establish an Interstate River Water Disputes Settlement Tribunal by a law. By the law the dispute may be excluded from jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

### 5. **Article 290**

Any dispute relating to the adjustment in respect of certain expenses and pensions 'payable to or in respect of a person who has served before the commencement of this constitution under the Crown in India or after such commencement in connection with the affairs of the union or of a State', shall be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Chief Justice of India.

#### 6. **Matters referred to Finance Commission**

Any matter referred to the Finance Commission under Article 280, shall be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

n n n

# (b) Appellate Jurisdiction

The Supreme Court, being the apex court is also the highest court of appeal in India. Therefore, all appeals lie to the Supreme Court. However, under Article 134A, the certificate issued by the high court is essential for appealing to the Supreme Court. Article 134A was inserted by the 44th Amendment Act.

Article 134A empowers the high courts to issue certificate for appeal to the Supreme Court. The high court can issue the certificate either on its own or if an application is made on behalf of the aggrieved. The high court can issue the certificate if the case merits and it has the discretion to reject the application for the certificate. However, the certificate issued by the high court is not binding on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decides to admit the petition of appeal on the basis of the merit of the case. The court can also reject the petition in its discretion. The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is of four categories namely:

- (i) Appeal in constitutional matters
- (ii) Appeal in civil matters
- (iii) Appeal in criminal matters
- (iv) Appeal by special leave

### *Appeal in Constitutional Matters*

Article 132 deals with the appeal in the constitutional matters. If any case 'involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution', then an appeal will lie to the Supreme Court from the orders, decree or judgement of a high court. The appeal is available in all cases—civil, criminal or other proceedings. The condition is that the case must involve a need for the interpretation of the constitution. 'Other proceedings' are the proceedings other than the civil or criminal proceedings such as any proceeding relating to sales tax, etc.

![](1__page_19_Figure_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 17.2: Appellate Jurisdiction

### *Appeal in Civil Matters*

Article 133 deals with the appeal to Supreme Court in the civil proceedings. The appeal will lie to Supreme Court from any judgment or final order if the high court under Article 134A, certifies that:

- The case involves a substantial question of law of general importance
- In the opinion of the high court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.

Before 1972, Article 133 contained a clause prescribing a monetary value for the appeal to Supreme Court in civil matters. Article 133 provided that if only the high court certifies that the case involved the claim of an amount of  $\bar{\tau}$  20000/ and above, the appeal will lie to Supreme Court. The Constitution (30th Amendment) 1972, removed the monetary condition.

# *Appeal in Criminal Matters*

Article 134 deals with the appeal in criminal matters. According to Article 134, the appeal in criminal matters is of two categories namely:

(i) **Without the Certificate of the High Court**

In any criminal case the appeal to the Supreme Court form the final order or decree of the high court without the certificate of appeal, will be available if the high court has:

- On appeal reversed an order of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death  $[Article 134 (a)] or;$
- Withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate to its authority and has in such trial convicted the accused person and sentenced him to death [Article 134 (b)].

#### (ii) **With the Certificate of the High Court**

In all the other cases the appeal will lie to the Supreme Court from the high court only when the certifies under Article 134A.

Thus, according to Article 134, appeals to Supreme Court is permitted in specific case. Articles 134 (a) and (b) permit appeal in case involving death sentence and Article 134(c) permits appeal in other cases. Clause (c) is much wider and if the high court certifies that the case merits the appeal then the appeal is competent.

#### **Supreme Court Guidelines on Issuing Certificate of Appeal**

- (a) In the Nar Singh versus State of UP case, the Supreme Court ruled that the power of the high court to grant the certificate of appeal is a discretionary power of the court. But the court has to exercise the power judicially on the 'well established lines'.
- (b) In the Siddheshwar Ganguly case, the Supreme Court ruled that the high court must not grant the certificate on the questions of fact and it shall be granted only in cases involving a substantial question of law. There must be an 'exceptional circumstance', for example, the case demands an appeal as substantial and grave injustice has been done.

## *Appeal by Special Leave*

Article 136 provides for the appeal by special leave granted by the Supreme Court. It is a discretionary power of the Supreme Court. The jurisdiction is of the widest amplitude as regards: $[13]$ 

- The court from whose decision the appeal may be entertained. The appeal will lie from any court including Administrative Tribunals except courts martial.
- The nature of the decision that may be appealed from. The appeal will lie in any kind of decision interim orders, final order, decree or judgment. Even in cases where no order has been passed by any tribunal, the appeal will lie if the case merits.
- The nature of the proceeding in which appeal may be entertained, it is irrespective of whether the proceeding is constitutional, civil, and criminal or other proceedings.
- The grounds that may be allowed to be raised for seeking such special leave.

From the above, it can be inferred that it is a 'plenary jurisdiction' vesting very wide powers and involves much of discretion to the Supreme Court. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the power must be 'exercised sparingly'.<sup>[14]</sup>

**Supreme Court Guidelines on the Exercise of the Power:** In various cases the Supreme Court has evolved the guidelines for the exercise of the power to grant appeal by special leave.

TABLE 17.1 Difference between Ordinary Appeal and Appeal by Special Leave

Firstly, the power must not be exercised in circumstances when the high court has taken the reasonably possible view.

Secondly, the appeal may be granted in cases where there has been a violation of the Principle of Natural Justice.

Thirdly, in civil cases, the appeal shall be granted only if the case involves a 'substantial question of law of general importance.

Fourthly, in criminal cases, the appeal shall be granted only when it is shown that 'exceptional circumstances exist that substantial and grave injustice has been done'.

Fifthly, with respect to the quasi-judicial tribunals, the appeal shall be granted only when they exceeded their jurisdiction.

Lastly, in general terms the appeal shall be granted only when ordinary course of appeal by other means is not applicable.

## (c) Writ Jurisdiction

Article 32, confers the power to issue writs for the enforcement of the fundamental rights. Article 32 (2) reads 'the Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights'.

The Supreme Court has laid down the following conditions for the exercise of the writ jurisdiction. If there has been any violation of fundamental rights, then the Supreme Court must not refuse to grant relief on the ground that:

- The person whose right is violated can seek remedy from some other court or under the ordinary law. This is because the Article 32 guarantees the remedies as a fundamental right or;
- The facts relevant to the dispute need to be investigated and the evidences regarding the violation of rights are not adduced or;

<sup>14</sup> Supreme Court: Mohd Khalil Chisti versus State of Rajasthan 2013.

- The writ pleaded in the case was not appropriate and corresponding to the right violated. It is the responsibility of the court to issue the proper writ because Article 32 vests the responsibility in the court or;
- The person whose right has been infringed has not approached the court. Thus, the public interest litigation is permitted.

The constitution confers the power to issue various writs to enforce the fundamental rights on the Supreme Court. Though Article 32 mentions only five writs, the court has the powers to issue other writs<sup>[15]</sup> if it was needed for the enforcement of the fundamental rights. Article 32 reads, 'Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate'.

**Writ of Habeas Corpus:** Habeas corpus literally means 'to produce the body of either alive or dead'. When the writ is issued the person needs to be produced before the court either alive or dead. The general rule is that only a person whose rights are infringed upon must only move the court for remedy. However, in case of a person on behalf of whom the writ of habeas corpus is sought is detained and remains in the custody of someone, the writ may be pleaded by any other person than the aggrieved.

The writ is meant for ascertaining whether a person detained or taken into custody has been done so in accordance with law or not. In case, the court is satisfied that the person was detained or taken in to custody unlawfully, then the court has the powers to order his release and set him free immediately. It effectively prevents the arbitrary use of the power by the executive. Thus, it is known as the 'bulwark of personal liberty'.

The writ may not be available in the cases:

- (i) In which the person is detained in a place over which the jurisdiction of the court does not extend.
- (ii) In which the person is detained for a proceeding for the contempt by a court of record or by Parliament.
- (iii) Of securing the release of a person imprisoned to serve the sentence imposed by a court of law on a criminal charge after due trial. However, the Supreme Court has relaxed this condition. The court had ruled that in case a person who is serving the sentence in a prison is subjected to torture or inhuman treatment then the writ may be applicable in such cases.

On the basis of the evidences produced before it, if the court is satisfied, that the person is subjected to such agony then, the court may issue the writ of habeas corpus. By this the court is only ordering the prison authorities to produce the person before the court, only to ascertain whether he was subjected to inhuman treatment or torture. The court need not set him free, for he is detained by the authority of law.

<sup>15</sup> Potential question in the Preliminary exam

### Writs: Origin

- • Writs originated in the English judicial system.
- Originally the power was vested with the King in Council.
- It was considered as a royal order.
- Initially writ was issued to protect the interest of the Crown.
- Later extended to grant relief to citizens as well.
- In India power to issue writs was vested in the Supreme Court by the Regulating Act, 1773.

The Supreme Court<sup>(16)</sup> in various cases had held that habeas corpus is granted, only if the detention is illegal. Principal grounds for challenging the legality of detention are as under:

- The law under which the detention order has been issued, is invalid.
- The order under which detention has been ordered, is invalid.
- Detention is not in compliance with the law.
- The order of detention is *mala fide*.
- The order of detention is based on irrelevant or extraneous considerations.
- The order is passed without application of the mind.

**Writ in case of 'Threatened Detention'**<sup>[17]</sup>: The exceptional cases, in which threatened detention may give rise to the writ, are where the court is satisfied about one of the following circumstances:

- The order of detention is not passed under the act under which it purports to be passed
- It is passed against a wrong personIt is passed for a wrong purpose
- It is passed on vague, extraneous and irrelevant grounds
- The officer purporting to pass the order has no authority, in law, to make the order.

**Writ of Mandamus:** Mandamus literally means 'to command'. When the fundamental rights of any person are infringed upon due to any public authority failing to perform his lawful duties then, the writ of mandamus lies against him. By issuing the writ the court directs the public servant to perform his duties. On the other hand, it is also issued to restrain a public servant form performing any act which is unconstitutional.

### Certiorari and Prohibition

The writs of certiorari and prohibition may be issued in cases of:

- Defect of jurisdiction
- • Non-observance of the rules of natural justice
- Errors of law

<sup>16</sup> The cases for the reference of this include Emperor versus Sibnath Banerjee, (AIR 1943 FC 75), Kishore Mohan versus State of West Bengal, (AIR 1972 SC 1749), Vimlabai Deshpande versus Emperor (AIR 1945) *et al*.

<sup>17</sup> Additional Secretary versus Alka Subhash Gadia, (1990).

It is to be noted that the writ of mandamus issued by a judge of Supreme Court will be binding on the Chief Justice in his administrative capacity. However, the writ is not applicable in the following cases:

- To direct the legislature to enact a law or restraining the legislature from making the law.
- Where the public servant is entrusted with the discretion of decision-making by law.
- Where the public servant is need not perform the particular function under any law.
- Involving private parties, the writ does not apply to private.
- Where it seeks to direct the President or the Governor of a State to exercise their executive powers.
- To compel a court or judicial tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction when it has refused to exercise it.

**Writ of Prohibition:** It is one of the writs issued by a superior court against an inferior court. The writ is issued in cases involving 'Error of Jurisdiction' of the court. This is issued even before the inferior court passes any order. The writ is issued when the inferior court acts:

- In excess of or without its jurisdiction or;
- In violation of the rules of natural justice or;
- Under any law which itself is unconstitutional or;
- In contravention to fundamental rights.

**Writ of Certiorari:** This is another writ issue by the superior court against the inferior court. The writ is issued in cases where a court has passed an order wrongfully. By issuing the writ of certiorari the superior court quashes (nullifies) the order made by the inferior court and withdraws the case for trial before itself.

The writ is issued in cases involving—Error of law, Error of facts, Error of procedure or Error of jurisdiction. The writ is issued when the court acts without sufficient evidence or the court misdirects itself in considering the available evidence or in case of any irregularity of procedure.

The writ is also applicable in case of administrative bodies which may not possess judicial obligations. In case the functions of the body affect the rights of the individuals by not conforming to the principle of natural justice.

Writ of Quo Warranto: It literally means 'by what authority'. It is a writ issued by the court to ascertain from which law a public servant derived the authority to perform a particular function. The writ is warranted when any authority is exercised without legal sanction. It is also available in cases involving any unreasonable act, where there is no principle to unquestionably justify the action. In such cases the State is bound to prove and explain on what authority the action was taken.

### *Limits of Writ Jurisdiction*

The Supreme Court in various cases identified the limits of the writ jurisdiction. There must be a clear breach of fundamental right not involving disputed questions of fact. Non-justifiable and political matters cannot be dealt with under the guise of public interest litigation. Policy preferences not involving fundamental rights cannot be agitated under Article 32 because 'articles of the constitution cannot be a means to indicate policy preference'. Hence, government policy cannot be enforced by writ under Article 32. A directive principle cannot be enforced by writ under Article 32.

### *Article 139 and Writs*

Article 139 empowers the Parliament to enact law to confer the power to issue writs for the purposes other than enforcement of the fundamental rights. According to Article 32, the Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights.

**RA 80** 

### (d) Advisory Jurisdiction

Article 143 deals with consultative or advisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Article 143 (1) states that if it appears to the President that:

- A question of law or fact has arisen or is likely to arise.
- Such question is of such nature or importance that.
- It is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon then he may refer the question to the Supreme Court for its consideration.

When any matter is so referred to the President, the Supreme Court can give its opinion to the President after 'such hearing as it thinks fit'. The court has the discretion of either giving its opinion to refusing to give its opinion.

For example, the Supreme Court gave its opinion in the Judges' case in 1999, by which the collegium system for the appointment of the judges is in operation. On the other hand, the court refused to give its opinion in respect of the Ram Jahnma Bhoomi issue.

However, according to Article 143 (2), if the President notwithstanding anything in the proviso to Article 131, then it is obligatory on the court to give its opinion to the President after due consideration and such hearing as it may think fit.

## (e) Revisory Jurisdiction

The judgements or orders made by the Supreme Court are binding on all courts within the territory of India (Article 141). However, according to Article 137, the Supreme Court has the powers to review and revise its own judgements. Such power to review is subjected to the law made by the Parliament and the rules made by Supreme Court under Article 145. Accordingly, any such review of the judgement of the court can be made by a bench which is larger than the original bench that delivered the judgement.

For example, the Supreme Court reviewed its judgement in A. K. Gopalan case and in the Maneka Gandhi case. The court reversed its judgement in the Golaknath case by the Kesavananda Bharti case.

In the Mandal Commission case the Court ruled that it 'would not depart from a long-settled interpretation solely depending upon the facts given case. Where, however, there has been no uniformity in previous decisions, the later court would examine the principle in the light of the scheme of the constitution and the materials placed before it.'

### *Enforcement of Decrees and Orders of Supreme Court*

The Supreme Court is vested with the power to pass any order 'necessary for doing complete justice in any matter pending before it'.<sup>[18]</sup> Any such order passed by the court is enforceable throughout India in accordance with the law made by the Parliament for the purpose. In the absence of such a law, the President has the power to prescribe by an order.

This is a plenary power of the Supreme Court 'for doing complete justice'. The court ruled that 'complete justice' demands granting equitable relief to eradicate injustice by this power.[19] Doing justice between parties is a constitutional obligation under Article 142. Further, the court also 'observed that it is advisable to leave this power undefined and un-catalogued, so that it remains elastic enough, to be moulded to suit the given situation'.<sup>[20]</sup> Under Article 142, 'the Supreme Court can grant appropriate relief where:

- There is some manifest illegality or;
- There is manifest want of jurisdiction or;
- Some palpable (felt) injustice is shown to have resulted. $(21)$

#### Do You Know?

- The term judicial review is not mentioned in the constitution.
- Judicial review is an implied power flowing from Article 13.

### JUDICIAL REVIEW

It is an essential feature of a federal constitution and is drawn from the American Constitution. In the USA, the power is derived by the court by interpreting the constitution. But the Indian Constitution confers the power on the judiciary by the provisions of Articles 13 and 32.

The original and appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court between Articles 131 and 136 also provide for judicial review. The scheme of dividing the legislative powers between the Parliament and the state legislatures is provided in Article 246. The scheme also confers the power of judicial review on the Supreme Court.

It is the power of the judiciary to review and determine the validity of any law. It is the power of the courts to enquire whether a law conflicts with the provisions of the written constitution. If the court is satisfied that the law conflicts with the constitution, the court has the powers to declare the law as *ultra vires* the constitution and therefore, void. The power of judicial review serves the following purposes:

- It seeks to protect the private rights (fundamental rights) of the individuals.
- It legitimizes the government actions.
- It helps in upholding the Rule of Law.
- It helps to ensure that provisions of the constitution are abided by.
- It prevents arbitrary us e of power or action.
- It ensures just standards of procedures.

#### Public Interest Litigation

- • The liberal interpretation of *locus standi* resulted in the rise of the concept of PIL
- PIL is a proceeding in which an individual or group seeks relief in the interest of general public and not for its own purpose.
- In PIL, there is no adjudication on individual rights.
- It is also known as 'Social Action Litigations'.
- In India PILs originated in the Hussainara Khatoon versus Bihar case (1979).
- Justice P. N. Bhagwati is the originator of the PIL in India.

# Principles of Judicial Review

The principles of judicial review as given by jurisprudence are as follows:

- (a) While entertaining a petition for reviewing a law, the court must presume that law is constitutionally valid and the onus of proving the unconstitutionality of the law lies with the person who challenges the law.
- (b) In case there are two interpretations to a schedule or any provision of a law, one violating the constitution and another upholding it, then the court shall prefer the latter to the former.
- (c) The court shall not go into the constitutional questions which are otherwise decided.
- (d) The court shall not decide larger questions than what is required by the case before it.
- (e) The court shall not hear an objection as to the constitutionality of the law by a person whose rights are not affected by it. This is known as the concept of *locus standi.*
- (f) The courts cannot pronounce the validity of an act or any of its parts which is not in force.
#### Judicial Review and Judicial Activism

Judicial review in India has enabled the Supreme Court to effectively play its constitutional role as the guardian of constitution and guarantor of fundamental rights. However, it has also resulted in the rise of judicial activism in India. Judicial activism is the result of courts expanding the jurisprudence and liberally interpreting the concept of *locus standi*. Executive and legislative inactivism has also contributed for the rise of judicial activism.

Where the constitution has not defined the scope of judiciary's powers, the judiciary has defined them on its own and has expanded the jurisprudence. For instance, the human rights and the power of the courts to uphold them are not defined anywhere in the constitution. This has given the scope for the courts to define them and assume the powers to them.

Similarly, the concept of *locus standi* has been liberally interpreted by courts. *Locus standi* demands that only a person who is aggrieved can move the court for relief. However, to give the poor improved access to justice, the court allowed social activists and lawyers to bring the case on the behalf of the poor.

Further, the failure of the executive and the legislature to fulfil their responsibilities to the satisfaction of the people has made them move the court seeking remedy. This has given the court the opportunity to usurp certain powers of the legislature and executive. Thus, the judicial review has resulted in the rise of judicial activism.

#### **Can Judicial Review and Judicial Activism be Distinguished?**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Is it possible to distinguish between judicial review and judicial activism in India? Does the recent behaviour of the Indian judiciary partake more of judicial activism? Argue with suitable examples. *IAS MAINS GS (2005)*

- (a) What is meant by 'Judicial Activism'? Evaluate its role in the context of the functioning of the Indian polity. *IAS MAINS (2008)*
- (b) Starting from inventing the 'basic structure' doctrine, the judiciary has played a highly proactive role in ensuring that India develops into a thriving democracy. In light of the statement, evaluate the role played by judicial activism in achieving the ideals of democracy.

*IAS MAINS GS Paper II*

It is often opined that judicial review and judicial activism are not distinguishable as it is difficult to identify where judicial review transforms to judicial activism. However, it is possible to distinguish the two by applying the principles of judicial review (please refer to the Principles of Judicial Review given above) defined by the jurisprudence. Any action of the judiciary that does not conform to the principles may become judicial activism.

## Judicial Activism in India

Judicial activism means any action of the judiciary which is beyond its constitutional mandate or expanding the jurisdiction of the courts or the courts acting '*suo moto*,' taking up cases on its own without being moved by any aggrieved person.

Judicial activism is not a new concept to India. The Golak Nath case and Kesavananda Bharti case are examples of judicial activism. In Golak Nath case, the Supreme Court by a majority view ruled that the fundamental rights are 'immutable and beyond the reach of the amendatory process'. That are the fundamental rights are not amendable and the Parliament does not have any power to amend any provision in Part-III.

In Kesavananda Bharati case, this judgment was overruled by a majority of seven against six. The Supreme Court held that by Article 368 of the Constitution the Parliament has powers amend to any part of the constitution including the Preamble and the fundamental rights. But the power cannot be exercised in the manner to alter the 'basic structure or framework of the constitution'. The court propounded the 'Doctrine of Basic Features', which was never discussed or envisaged by the founding fathers of the constitution.

#### Obiter Dicta

*Obiter dicta* is that part of the judgement which was strictly not necessary for the disposal of the cause or matter before the court.

That which was necessary to dispose of the matter and forms the crux of the decision is called *ratio dicidendi*— 'the rationale for the decision'

Later in certain other judgements, the court had broadened the scope of the environmental laws and had even gone to the extent of passing orders that amount to making policies. At a point in time, the post lunch session of the Supreme Court on every Friday was scheduled for hearing the cases relating to environmental issues. It was known as 'Green Bench'. The Supreme Court orders relating to the Delhi CNG case, ban on plying the vehicles which were older than 15 years on the roads of Delhi and the order for removing the foundries around the Taj Mahal on the ground of curtailing pollution are worth quotable examples.

The court has also interfered in the legislative privileges while exercising the power of judicial review. In UP, Kalyan Singh headed Council of Ministers were dismissed by the then Governor on his subjective assessment of loss of confidence. The Governor, then appointed Jagdambika Pal as the Chief Minister of UP. This was a clear breach of the Bommai case guidelines and Kalyan Singh moved the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court. The court exercised the power to restore the *status quo ante* and reinstated Kalyan Singh as Chief Minister. Thus, at that time UP had two Chief Ministers, resulting in a constitutional question. Later, the high court directed the Speaker of the UP Legislative Assembly to conduct a secret ballot to determine on whom the House had confidence. This is a clear breach of the privilege of the House and is an example of judicial activism.

Though the eventuality was created by the Governor by not following the Supreme Court guideline, the experts were of the view that the high court could have restrained itself from ordering the legislative procedure.

The executive and the legislature had deplored this behaviour of the judiciary. The executive had called this as 'judicial tyranny' and it will result in 'rule by judiciary' than 'rule of law'. At times it is criticized as the result of the 'popular proclivities of the individual judges'. This has often made the executive to refrain from making decision fearing the judicial intervention. This has slowed down the decision-making in government which in turn has adversely affected the public welfare.

However, the view of the judiciary in this regard is different. The judiciary refuses the presence of anything called judicial activism in India. The judiciary is of the view that the founding fathers envisaged an active judiciary, for they had entrusted the responsibility of ensuring that the executive and legislature exercised their powers conforming to the constitution towards securing the welfare of the people and without infringing upon their rights. Hence, the glaring 'inactivism' of the executive and the legislature is construed as judicial activism.

#### High Courts having Jurisdiction Over More than one State and Not Over UTs

- 1. Punjab and Haryana High Court
- 2. Guwahati High Court
- 3. Andhra Pradesh High Court

- 5. Madras High Court
- 6. Kerala High Court
- 7. Kolkata High court

4. Bombay High Court

**...** 

According to Justice Krishna Iyer, coining the term judicial activism is the mischief of the press. He said 'judicious use of the power of judicial review by the judiciary' is termed as judicial activism. Further, the Supreme Court also has ruled that judicial activism is an essential feature of an independent judiciary. It refers to the right of individual judges to express and record their observation and opinion as *obiter dicta* along with the judgment they deliver. This will enable the legislature and the executive to fulfil their constitutional duties better. It will also open to them a new perspective with respect to the policies of the government. This needs to be taken in right spirit. Although, the above view is accepted in one sense, judicial activism has caused several impediments.

## THE HIGH COURTS

Article 214 of the constitution provides for a high court for each State. The high court is at the head of the judicial administration of a State. At present there are 25 high courts in India after the setting up of Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura high courts in 2013 and Andhra Pradesh High Court in 2019. Of the 25 high courts:

- 1. High Court of Punjab and Haryana has jurisdiction over the States of Punjab, Haryana and their common capital Chandigarh.
- 2. Kolkata High Court has jurisdiction over the State of West Bengal and the UT of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
- 3. Guwahati High Court has jurisdiction over the North–Eastern States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland.
- 4. Madras High Court has jurisdiction over the State of Tamil Nadu and the UT of Puducherry.
- 5. Kerala High Court has jurisdiction over the State of Kerala and UT of Lakshadweep.
- 6. Bombay High Court has jurisdiction over the State of Maharashtra, Goa and the UT of Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu.

According to Article 216, every high court consists of a Chief Justice and other judges. The number of judges in the high courts is fixed by the President from time to time as he deems necessary. Article 215 declares the high courts to be Courts of Record and so the high courts also enjoy the same powers as the Supreme Court.

Article 230 empowers the Parliament to extend the jurisdiction of a high court to any Union territory, by a law. Similarly, the Parliament also has the power to exclude any UT from the jurisdiction of a high court.

In the same way, the Parliament has the powers to establish common high courts for two or more States or for two or more States and a UT (Article 231).

## APPOINTMENT OF A JUDGE OF A HIGH COURT

A judge of a high court is appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and, in the case of appointment of a judge other than Chief Justice of the high court.[22]

## **Qualification**

To be appointed as a judge of a high court, a person must be a citizen of India and has for at least ten years:

- Held a judicial office in the territory of India or;
- Been an advocate of a high court or of two or more such courts in succession.

<sup>22</sup> Article 217, Since the Supreme Court had declared the National Judicial Appointments Commission as unconstitutional, the older method of consulting the Chief Justice and the Governor of the State is restored.

# Term of office

Judge of high court once appointed shall hold office until he attains the age of 62. However, a judge may resign by writing under his hand addressed to the President. A judge of high court is removed on the like grounds and in the like manner as a judge of Supreme Court is removed.

Apart from the above reasons a judge of high court may vacate if he is appointed as a judge of Supreme Court or transferred to another high court, by the President. A judge of high court is transferred from one high court to another by the President after consulting the Chief Justice of India, Chief Justices of the respective high courts from which he is transferred and the court to which he is transferred. The transfer of the judges is subjected to judicial review. $[23]$ 

## WRIT JURISDICTION OF THE HIGH COURT

The high courts also have the power to issue writs like the Supreme Court. Unlike the power of the Supreme Court, the high courts have the power to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal rights. According to the Supreme Court, in the power conferred upon the high court under Article 226 is discretionary in nature which can be invoked for the enforcement of any fundamental right or legal right. $[24]$

1. Both the Supreme Court and the high court's issue the writs of remain same.

- 2. While the writ issued by the Supreme Court is applicable throughout India, the writ issued by the high courts is applicable only within its territorial limits and by the existence of cause of action within the State territory.
- 3. The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court flows out of the citizen's right to constitutional remedies under Article 32. But the writ jurisdiction of the high courts under Article 226 is not a fundamental right.
- 4. Therefore, the remedy provided under Article 226 is at the discretion of the high courts. But in cases in which the infringement of fundamental rights is established, the Supreme Court has no discretion but it has to grant remedy.
- 5. The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of the fundamental rights whereas the high courts under Article 226 can issue writs for enforcement of both fundamental rights and any other legal rights.
- 6. The high court can deny issuing writ in case an alternative remedy is available however, this does not bar the court from issuing the writs.
- 7. Hence, the high court can decline to entertain writs while the Supreme Court cannot.

## Power of Superintendence Over Subordinate Courts

The high court has the power of 'superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction' (Article 227). It is noteworthy to mention here that the Supreme Court does not have the power to superintendence, although it is the apex court. Article 222 confers upon the high courts the power to:

- Call for returns from such courts
- Make and issue general rules and prescribe
- Forms for regulating the practice and proceedings of such courts
- Prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts shall be kept by the officers of any such courts.

However, this power does not extend over any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.

## Transfer of Cases: Article 228

The high court can withdraw a case from a subordinate court if the case 'involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this constitution'. By this the high court can dispose of the case itself or it can return the case the concerned subordinate court to dispose after determining the question.

## Officers and Servants and the Expenses of High Courts: Article 229

All the officers and the servants of the high court are appointed by the Chief Justice of the high court. The Chief Justice may also authorize any other judge or officer of the high court to exercise this power of appointment.

The conditions of service of the officers of the high court are prescribed by the Chief Justice in accordance with the law of the legislature.

All the administrative expenses of a high court, including all salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of the officers and servants of the court, shall be charged upon the Consolidated Fund of the State.

#### SUBORDINATE JUDICIARY

Each district in India has civil courts hearing civil cases, criminal courts disposing of criminal cases and revenue courts.

Property disputes, breach of contract, etc., are few examples of civil cases. Civil courts settle these disputes.

Criminal cases are those which deal with an offence or crime. According to the Supreme Court, an offence is an act of violation of laws.<sup>[25]</sup> Cases relating to disputes regarding land revenue, etc., are known as revenue cases.

### Qualifications and Appointment of Judges

According to Article 233, the subordinate court judges are appointed by the Governor after consulting the Chief Justice of high court exercising jurisdiction over the State. Article 233A, inserted by the Constitution 20th Amendment, prescribes the qualification for the appointment of a district judge.
