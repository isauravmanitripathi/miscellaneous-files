## INTRODUCTION RIGHT TO FREEDOMS (ARTICLES 19–22)

The most important of all fundamental rights is personal liberty. The provisions of Articles 19 to 22 deal with personal liberty. These provisions form the backbone of fundamental rights.

## Article 19: Right to Particular Freedoms

In the original constitution, Article 19 guaranteed seven freedoms namely:

- 1. Freedom of speech and expression [Article 19 (1) (a)].
- 2. Freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms [Article 19 (1) (b)].
- 3. Freedom to form unions, associations or cooperatives [Article 19 (1) (c)].
- 4. Freedom to movement throughout the territory of India (Article 19 (1) (d)).
- **5.** Freedom to reside or settle anywhere within India (Article 19 (1) (e)).
- 6. Freedom of owning and acquiring property [Article 19 (1) (f)].
- 7. Freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business (Article 19 (1) (g)).

Of the seven freedoms, the right to property was omitted by the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978. This has been already explained. Hence, in effect at present there are only six freedoms guaranteed by the constitution. Such rights are available only to citizens of India.

## *Right to Freedoms Is Not Absolute*

In any civilized society the fundamental right cannot be guaranteed absolutely and without restrictions. Rights guaranteed without any restrictions will result in chaos and anarchy. To guarantee absolute fundamental rights

is detrimental to the society. 'If people were given complete and absolute liberty without any social control the result would be ruin'.<sup>[1]</sup> The Supreme Court in A. K. Gopalan case expressed that 'man as a rational being desires to do many things, but in a civil society his desires have to be controlled, regulated and reconciled with the exercise of similar desires of other individuals'. Therefore, in order to uphold the collective liberty of the society and enable smooth exercise of fundamental rights by every member if society, the individual rights are to be restricted. The power to impose such restrictions by law is conferred on the state by the constitution. However, such restrictions have to be only the grounds given in Articles 19 (2) to (6) corresponding to the rights guaranteed by Article 19 (1) and must be a 'reasonable restriction'.

#### *Reasonable Restrictions—Supreme Court Guidelines*

The word 'reasonable' implies intelligent care and deliberation which reason dictates. Hence, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and excessive so that it completely prevents a person from exercising his rights. The Supreme Court laid down the following guidelines to determine the reasonableness of the restrictions:<sup>(2)</sup>

- The courts have the final authority to judge the reasonableness of any restriction.
- The restrictions must have a reasonable relation with the legislation and must not exceed the objective.
- There is no standard or general pattern of reasonableness and each case shall be treated in its own merit.
- Restrictions must be reasonable from the procedural and substantive standpoints, i.e., the duration and circumstances calling for restriction should also be considered.
- The restrictions imposed for securing the objective of Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) can also be regarded as reasonable restrictions.
- At times, the restriction may be in the form of prohibiting or depriving the citizens of certain fundamental rights.
- While judging the reasonableness of any restriction, the courts shall confine to that question only, i.e., the law imposing such restriction should not be reviewed.

The question of reasonableness has been considered by the Supreme Court in many cases and the court has laid down several tests and guidelines. The major criterion must be to ensure that the law balances the social control and the individual rights properly. In this regard, 'the court must consider the following aspects:

- Nature of the right infringed.
- Underlying purpose of the restriction imposed.
- Evils sought to be remedied by the law, its extent and urgency.
- How far the restriction is or is not proportionate to the evil.
- Prevailing conditions at the time'. $^{(3)}$

Further, the Supreme Court<sup> $(4)$ </sup> had held that 'the considerations which generally prevail and must be satisfied in judging the validity of a law in the context of reasonable restrictions are whether the:

- Law imposes a restriction on the freedom in question.
- Restrictions have been imposed by law.
- Restrictions are reasonable.
- Restrictions besides being reasonable, is imposed for one of the specified purposes relevant to the freedom in question as enumerated in the applicable clause out of clauses (2) to (6) of the article'.

## Article 19 (1) (a): Freedom of Speech and Expression

This is an indispensable right in a democracy. 'Freedom of speech … lay the foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political discussions no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government is possible'.<sup>[5]</sup> It means right to express one's own convictions and opinion freely by words of mouth, writing, printing, pictures, gestures or any other modes.

## *Significance of Freedom of Speech and Expression*

Every member of a society needs to be guaranteed the liberty to form his opinion and belief and express it to others freely. Preamble declares that the citizens of India shall have the 'liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship'. The four broad purposes which the freedom of speech and expression serves are namely:

- 1. Enabling an individual to attain self-fulfilment.
- 2. Assisting an individual to discover the truth.
- 3. Building the capacity of an individual so that he effectively takes part in the decision-making process.
- 4. It helps in balancing the social change without affecting the social stability.

#### Self-fulfilment—What the Constitution Seeks to Achieve?

- It refers to making one feel complete and unfold the best in him.
- It represents the achievement of aspirations to the highest level.
- It is an indication that one leads a meaningful life worth living.

## *Scope of the Freedom*

Freedom of speech refers to expressing one's views by word of mouth. The term 'expression' in Article 19 (1) (a) means the freedom of expressing the views/ideas by other modes such as writing, printing, gestures, symbols, any art forms, etc., through any medium of communication.

The Supreme Court in the Union of India versus Association for Democratic Reforms case ruled that the right to vote guaranteed by Article 326 is also implied in the term 'expression'. As a logical corollary, the citizen's right to know the antecedents of the candidate contesting the election is also a right included in the freedom. So, the court directed the Election Commission to take appropriate measures to keep the voter informed about the criminal antecedents<sup> $(6)$ </sup> of the candidates. Since then, it has been made mandatory.

**(a) Freedom of Expression of Dissent:** The freedom includes the freedom of expressing one's dissent. 'Strike' is considered to be a form of expressing dissent. However, the Supreme Court<sup>[7]</sup> ruled that *Bandh* do not fall within the fundamental right of speech. A *Bandh* is a warning to a citizen that if he goes for work or opens his shop he would be prevented. The distinction drawn between *Bandh* and a call to general strike or *Hartal* is well made out with reference to the effect of a Bandh on the fundamental rights of citizens. There cannot be any doubt that the fundamental rights of people as a whole cannot be sub-servant to the claim of fundamental right of an individual or only a section of the people. There can-

<sup>6</sup> Information relating to any criminal case filed against the candidate or any punishment imposed previously.

<sup>7</sup> Communist Party of India (M) vs. Bharat Kumar, AIR 1998 SC 18.

not be any right to call or enforce a *Bandh* which conflicts, with the exercise of the fundamental rights of other citizens, in addition to causing national loss in many ways.

#### Strike—How it is Viewed?

- • In many countries including the UK and Germany protest from workers is viewed as industrial action.
- Industrial action may be in the form of strike or refusing to work overtime.
- • In Germany, strike is permitted by law if organized by a trade union based on the voting of the members supporting the strike.
- In the USA, the Taft-Hartley Act, 1947, bans strike by public and government servants.
- In UK, there is no legal ban on strike but the unions enjoy legal immunity and protection for calling for an industrial action.
- The Canadian Supreme Court, in 2015, declared that strike is a right.

Further, in the Tamil Nadu government employee's case the court ruled that the right of 'collective bargaining' of the trade unions does not include the right to strike. The government employees calling for strike was held unconstitutional. The court ruled that strike is 'neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right nor a democratic right'.

**(b) Criticism Hate Speech and Sedition:** The Cambridge dictionary defines criticism as 'an act of giving opinion or judgement about the good or bad qualities of something or someone'. It is an act of appreciation or assessment. The state must not prohibit criticism against the actions of the state. It is implied in the freedom of speech and expression and falls well within the scope of the right.

However, the freedom does not permit abusing or slandering or hate speech. 'Hate speech is speech perceived to disparage a person or group of people based on their social or ethnic group such as race, gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, language ability, ideology, social class, occupation, appearance (height, weight, skin colour, etc.), mental capacity, and any other distinction that might be considered by some as a liability. The term covers written as well as oral communication and some forms of behaviour in a public setting'.<sup>[8]</sup>

In the competitive politics of the present-day, hate speech has become fashion and adopted to strike immediate attention and popularity. But it is destructive and obstructs the purposes which the freedom of speech serves. It creates rift among the united society, divide people and endangers harmonious coexistence. It can also sow seeds of sedition, parochialism and ultimately tear the social fabric apart.

Similarly, the right does not permit any sedition against the state. It is not included in the freedom of speech and expression. According to Indian Penal Code (IPC), 'When the words have the pernicious or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order', it is known as sedition. That is any expression intended to create hatred or contempt against the government of India is considered an act of sedition under Section 124A of IPC.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What do you understand by the concept 'freedom of speech and expression'? Does it cover hate speech also? *IAS Mains (2014 GS Paper 2)*

<sup>8</sup> e-Study Guide for: Essentials of Human Communication by Joseph A. DeVito.

#### Council of Europe's Manual on Hate Speech

The manual regards the following types of hate speech:

- Racial and religious hate
- Homophobia
- Negationism
- Threat to democratic order
- Hate speech and internet

**(c) Right to Know:** Right to speech and expression implies the right of the citizen to know what the government does in his welfare and with the tax money collected from the citizen. Thus, the freedom comes to confer the right to information on the citizen. In the L. K. Koolwal versus State of Rajasthan case 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that, 'A citizen has a right to know about the activities of the state. The privilege of secrecy which existed in old times, (namely) that the state is not bound to disclose the facts to the citizens or the state cannot be compelled by the citizens to disclose the facts, does not survive now. Under Article 19 there exists the right of freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is based on the foundation of freedom of right to know'. However, the state has the power to impose reasonable restrictions in case the right to know affected national security or nation's integrity.

**(d) Freedom of Press:** The freedom of expression also includes the freedom to elicit opinions from others. It is based on the principle of peoples' the 'right to know'. It includes not only the right to express one's opinion and elicit opinion of the others but also to propagate such opinions through printing and publishing through print electronic, cyber and mass media. Thus, it leads to the freedom of press, i.e., freedom of press is implied in Article 19 (1) (a). 'Freedom of the press is not expressly mentioned in Article 19 but has been held to flow from the general freedom of speech and expression guaranteed to all citizens'.<sup>[9]</sup> Freedom of press is thus, implied in the freedom of expression. The freedom of press has not been given expressively in the constitution in order to:

- Prevent the divisive forces abusing or misusing the freedom.
- Prevent any hurting of the sentiments of the minorities.
- Prevent any form of expression that may affect the social fabric adversely.
- Prevent the political parties, caste and communal associations using the right to serve their vested interest.

Freedom of press flows from the citizen's right to know. The mandate of the constitution is that the press must report only such information what the citizen wants to know and what is constructive and progressive. In the Sushil Chowdhary versus State of Tripura case (1997), the court ruled that freedom of speech and press, are not so much for the benefit of the press, as for the benefit of the general community. Government's duty to ensure circulation of newspapers arises, because the community has a right to be supplied with information, and government owes a duty to educate the people within the limits of its resources.

Further, the court had advised the press must be careful and responsible in exercising this right. The Supreme Court in the Hari Jai Singh case held that the press 'Could not escape responsibility for careless publication'. It was case of a newspaper falsely publishing a news that the Petroleum Minister unduly using his discretion to extend favour to the sons of a senior judge of Supreme Court and the son of the Chief Justice in allocating petrol outlets.

Such freedom is therefore, subjected to the reasonable restrictions on the grounds given in Article 19 (2). Thus, the Constitution of India provides for the pre-censorship of press even during the normal times. It is unknown in other democracies like the USA and Britain. They have censorship only during the emergency times.

n n n

<sup>9</sup> Supreme Court: Printers Mysore vs. Assistant Commercial Law Officer: 1994 SCR (1) 682, 1994 SCC (2) 434.

The censorship of press in India is done through the imposition of reasonable restrictions. This becomes all the more absolute during the time of emergency as Article 19 remains suspended subjected to Article 358. The pre-censorship of motion pictures also fall under this category.

**(e) Freedom of Press and Trial by Media:** The freedom of press implied in Article 19 (1) (a) at times results in the overenthusiastic media reporting which results in 'trial by media'. Human beings naturally have a thirst for sensational news. This creates competition among the media to publish their 'version of facts'. But this sort of investigatory journalism is ridden with high risk. Although this is also a part of the freedom of press, this requires to be exercised with utmost care and subjected to limits imposed by the right to reputation and right to privacy of people. Moreover, such reporting must not also be a contempt of court.

#### Trial by Media—Important Cases

- Sheena Bohra murder case
- • Priyadarshini Mattoo case
- • Jessica Lal case
- • Nitish Katara murder case
- • Bijal Joshi rape case

The press while reporting must not cause any damage to the reputation of or cause defamation to any individual or hamper the legal process of trial of a case in the court. 'Dignity of the court and fairness of trial', would be paramount in the trial of any case and that must not be infringed on any account. This is fully consistent with the right of freedom of speech and expression, as Article 19 (2) empowers the state to reasonably restrict the right.

#### *Grounds of Reasonable Restrictions*

Article 19 (2) prescribes the grounds on which the right to freedom of speech and expression can be restricted. Accordingly, the right can be restricted on the grounds of the 'interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence'.[10] Of these the 'interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India', was added by the 16th Amendment Act 1963, in the wake of the DMK movement in Tamil Nadu.

## Article 19 (1) (b): Freedom of Assembly

The constitution guarantees to all citizens the right to assemble in any place within the territory of India. But the assembly must be 'peaceable and without arms'. Democracy implies the right to assembly. The right to hold meetings and taking out processions is also implied in the right. Any disorderly or riotous assembly does not enjoy the protection of Article 19 (1) (b).

Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 141 defines the 'unlawful assembly'. According to IPC, unlawful assembly means an assembly of five or more persons if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is:

1. To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the central or any state government or Parliament or the legislature of any state, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant.

<sup>10</sup> Constitution of India: Article 19 (2).

- 2. To resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process.
- 3. To commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence.
- 4. By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right.
- 5. By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do.

## *Grounds of Reasonable Restrictions*

Article 19 (3) empowers the state to restrict freedom of assembly on the grounds of public order and to maintain the sovereignty and integrity of India. The Supreme Court has ruled that the right can be exercised only on the public land. Further, imposing any restriction to maintain traffic in any area is also a reasonable restriction under Article 19 (3). However, the restrictions cannot 'absolute prohibition at least in normal times'.

## Article 19 (1) (c): Freedom to form Association

Every citizen of India is guaranteed the right 'To form associations or unions or cooperative societies'. The right implies the formation of an organization or a permanent relationship between persons who share a common concern or interest. 'The right to freedom of association covers a variety of right, so long as the association is for lawful purpose'. The right includes the right to start or continue an association, to join or not to join an association.

#### *Meaning*

According to Indian Trade Union Act, 1926, a 'Trade union is a voluntary organization of workers pertaining to a particular trade, industry or a company and formed to promote and protect their interests and welfare by collective action. They are formed not only to cater to the workers' demand, but also for inculcating in them the sense of discipline and responsibility'. According to the Societies Registration Act, 1860, any seven or more persons associated for any literary, scientific, or charitable purpose, or for any such purpose.

According to legal dictionary, 'Cooperative is an association or corporation established for the purpose of providing services on a non-profit basis to its shareholders or members who own and control it'.

## *Grounds of Reasonable Restrictions*

The right is subjected to reasonable restriction by a law on the ground of the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality. However, the right can only be restricted by legislative action and cannot be restricted by executive orders.<sup> $(11)$ </sup> Apart from the above the right is subjected to following restrictions:

- Article 33, imposes restriction upon the fundamental rights in general and bans the forming of an association or trade union for the members of armed forces.
- Any union or association formed for a lawful purpose must be registered with the government in accordance with law, within six months from the date of formation.
- The governments servants are restricted by the Civil Services Conduct rules from joining any or continue to be a member of any union or association that has not been recognized by the government.
- Only a member of the union or association can become the chairperson/president of the union. A government servant must not be a member of such union or association of which a non-member is chairperson.

## *Article 19 (1) (c) and Article 19 (1) (a)*

The right to form association and the right to strike are to be dealt with together. The Supreme Court in the Tamil Nadu government employees' strike case ruled that the right to 'collective bargaining' of the trade union does not confer them the right to strike. Although strike is a form of expressing dissent, it is neither a fundamental right, nor a constitutional right nor a legal right.

#### *Right to Form Cooperatives, Constitution (97th Amendment) Act, 2011*[12]

The Constitution (97th Amendment) Act, 2011 enacted with the objective to enhance public faith in cooperatives and insulate them from avoidable political and bureaucratic interference. The Act inserted the term 'Cooperatives' in Article 19 (1) (c) after the association and unions.

It also inserted the Article 43 B in the Part IV, DPSP. It inserted the Part IXB 'The Cooperative Societies' after the Part IXA municipalities. This part contains 13 Articles from Article ZH to Article ZT.

These provisions are only enabling provisions, to empower the state legislatures to regulate the cooperative societies. This amendment also seeks to strike uniformity in respect of the cooperative societies through the nation.

#### *Salient Features of the Constitution (97th Amendment) Act, 2011*

The Act provides for the formation of state and multi-state cooperative societies subjected to the regulation of the law made by the legislatures.

Article 243ZI provides for the incorporation, regulation and winding up of cooperative societies based on the principles of voluntary formation, democratic member control, member economic participation and autonomous functioning.

Article 243ZJ specifies the maximum number of directors of a cooperative society to be not exceeding twenty-one members. However, the number of members of the board can be regulated by the state legislatures.

Article 243ZJ also makes it an obligation that the state law to provide for reservation on the board of every cooperative society:

- 1. One seat for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes.
- 2. Two seats for women, which have individuals as members from such categories.

**Term of Office:** The elected board and its office-bearers shall have a fixed term of five years from the date of election. That is, the term of office of the office-bearers is coterminous with the term of the board. (Article ZJ)

**Casual Vacancy:** In case of occurrence of a casual vacancy (vacancy in the board before the expiry of the term of office) the board can fill it by nomination of members. Such members must be nominated from the same class of members in respect of which the vacancy has occurred. The nomination can be done only in case where the term of office of the board is less than half of its original term of five years.

#### Cooperatives in India—A historical view

- First Cooperatives Act was enacted in 1904.
- 'Urban Cooperative Credit Society' registered in Kanjivaram, Madras Presidency in October, 1904 was India's first cooperative organization.
- In 1914 Maclagan was appointed to study progress of cooperatives in India.
- Government of India Act, 1919 brought cooperatives to the provincial list.
- R. G. Saraiya Committee on cooperative planning was set-up in 1945.
- • Committee recommended that cooperative societies to be the most suitable medium for democratization of economic planning.

<sup>12</sup> This is the highlight and important provisions of the law.
**Co-opted Members:** Persons having experience in the field of banking, management, finance or specialization in any other field relating to the objectives of the cooperative society can be co-opted members of the society. The state legislature is empowered to make provisions in this regard by law:

- 1. The number of co-opted members shall not exceed two in addition to the 21 directors.
- 2. The co-opted members do not have the right to vote or be eligible to be elected as office-bearers of the society.

**Election:** The election to the board has to be conducted before the expiry of the term of the board. The newly elected members must assume office before the expiry of the term of office of the outgoing board.

The power of superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls is to be vested in the authority as prescribed by the law of the state legislature.

The concerned authority shall be empowered to conduct the election in accordance with the procedures and guidelines made by the state legislature by law.

**Suspension of the Board:** Any board cannot be suspended or superseded for a period of six months. It also defines the causes on which the board can be suspended or superseded as:

- 1. Persistent default.
- 2. Negligence in the performance of its duties.
- 3. The committing any act prejudicial to the interest of the cooperative society.
- 4. Stalemate in the constitution of the board.
- 5. Failure of the conduct of the election to the board in accordance with the provisions of law.

**Administrator:** In case the board is suspended or superseded an administrator shall be appointed to manage the affairs of the board. It is the responsibility of the administrator to arrange for the conduct of the election and the handing over of the management of the board to the newly elected board.

**Limits to the Power of Suspension of the Board:** The board in which the government has no shareholding cannot be suspended or superseded.

**Accounts and Audit (Article 243ZM):** It provides for independent professional audit. The following are mandatory requirements of the audit:

- Maintenance of accounts of cooperative societies.
- Auditing of accounts once in each financial year within six months of the close of the financial year to which such accounts relate.
- Lay down the minimum qualification and experience of auditors auditing firms which shall be eligible for auditing accounts.

## *Filing of Return (Article 243ZP)*

- 1. Every cooperative society shall have to file return within six months of close of financial year to the designated authority.
- 2. The return should include the following matters relating to:
  - Annual report of its activities.
  - Audited statement of accounts.
  - Plan for surplus disposal as approved by the general body of the cooperative society.
  - List of amendments to the bye-laws of the cooperative society.
  - Declaration regarding holding of general body meeting and conduct of elections when due.
  - Any other information required by the registrar in pursuance of any of the provisions of the state act.

n n n

**Right to Information:** Every member of the cooperative society shall have the right to access to the books, information, and accounts of the society kept in regular transaction of its business with such member (Article 243ZO). This is subjected to the provisions of the law of the state legislature.

The state law must provide for the cooperative education and training for its members.

**Offences and Penalties:** The following are regarded as offence under the law:

- Wilfully making false returns
- Furnishing false information
- Wilfully defaulting on supplying of information
- Wilfully disobeying summons without reasonable excuse
- Wilfully failing to handover books in custody
- Corrupt practices

## Article 19 (1) (d): Freedom of Movement

The constitution guarantees every citizen of India is the right to freedom of movement within the territory of India. The right is in consonance with the single citizenship. The right enables the movement of the citizen throughout the country and intermingling of people belonging to different particle. Thus, enables cultural interaction and exchange. This is part of 'nation-building' process. Free movement and cultural interaction would also prevent the rise of parochial tendencies and divisive forces.

### *Going Abroad*

The right to free movement also includes the right to travel/go to a foreign country and returning back to India. Although the constitution does not provide this expressly, the Supreme Court, in the Maneka Gandhi case ruled that the right includes the right to travel abroad. The National Commission to review the working of the constitution recommended that the right to going abroad should be included in Article 19 (1) (d) by an amendment. However, it is yet to be included.

#### *Grounds of Reasonable Restrictions*

The right may be reasonably restricted on the grounds of Article 19 (5) on the grounds of public interest and the protection of interest of the Scheduled Tribes.

#### *Other Restrictions on Free Movement*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What are the constitutional limitations on the free movements of Indians throughout the country? *IAS MAINS (2006)*

The free movement within territory of India can be restricted on certain other grounds than given in Article 19 (5) are:

- The special status conferred to Jammu and Kashmir. Although the right to free movement is guaranteed to every citizen throughout India it is subjected to the provisions of the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir within the state.
- Freedom of movement is curtailed in respect of the restricted areas such as military areas, etc.
- In case of preventive detention under Article 22.
- The freedom of movement is curtailed the privileges of the legislatures, Parliament and state legislatures (Articles 105 and 194).
- The restrictions imposed by a law of Parliament on the free trade under Article 302 will in effect restrict the free movement of persons also. Similarly, the restrictions imposed by a law of state legislature on

the free trade under Article 304 will in effect restrict the free movement of persons also.

- The freedom of movement is restricted by the power of the Supreme Court and high courts within their premises.
- The freedom of movement is restricted in respect of the private properties and institutions such as educational institutions, industrial set-up, etc., in accordance with the rules of such institutions.

## Article 19 (1) (e): Right to Freedom of Residence and Settlement

Every citizen of India has the right to reside and settle anywhere within the territory of India. This is a corollary and complementary to the right to movement and serves the same purpose as the right to movement. The objective of the right is to remove the barriers within different parts of India.

The right is, therefore, subjected to reasonable restrictions on the same grounds as the right to free movement, namely public interest and the protection of interest of the Scheduled Tribes. The freedom is restricted in the interest of the Scheduled Tribes to enable them to preserve their unique culture, traditional knowledge and remain away from the influence of other sections of the society.

# Article 19 (1) (g): Right to Freedom of Profession and Occupation

It provides for the right to freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business to every citizen of India. According to the Supreme Court, the right is guaranteed in order to ensure that the citizens' right to business does not depend on the grant of the state. The state cannot prevent anyone from undertaking a business except by a law and only imposing the 'reasonable restrictions'. According to Article 19 (6), the state can impose reasonable restrictions on the right on the ground of 'public interest'.

## *Conditions*

The right is subjected to certain conditions and Article 19 (6), prescribes two conditions namely:

- 1. The state may prescribe 'professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business'. For instance, to be practice the doctor's profession one needs to have graduated in medicine and must have registered with the Medical Council of India.
- 2. The state or a corporation owned or controlled by the state, may monopolize or partially exclude the citizens and carry on any trade, business, industry or service. For instance, the railways in India are operated only by the union government.

Such conditions are not to be considered as restriction and challenged on the ground of being unreasonable. The conditions are imposed in the public interest. Apart from the above there are few other conditions interpreted by the Supreme Court in various cases. Such conditions are:

- The right is only to carry on a legal business which is not immoral and not causing danger to the public. It does not apply to immoral business or occupation.
- The state may prescribe a license and a fee for acquiring the license.
- The business, occupation or profession may be subjected to certain laws regulating the same. For example, the Minimum Wages Act.
- The state may impose certain taxes, for example, the state may impose professional tax or income tax, service tax, etc.
- The state may regulate certain aspects of a profession, for example, the law firms are prevented from advertising themselves and marketing.
- 'There is no fundamental right to do trade or business in intoxicants the state possesses the right of complete control over all aspects of intoxicants viz., manufacture, collection, sale and consumption, and the nature of trade is such that the state confers the right to vend liquor by

n n n

farming out either in action or on private treaty, and the rental collected is neither a tax nor an excise duty, but a consideration for the agreement for grant of privilege by the government'.<sup> $(13)$ </sup>

### Article 19 (1) (g) and Free Trade

The provisions of Articles 301 to 307, deal with trade, commerce and intercourse within the territory of India. Article 19 and the provisions of free trade are to be read together. These provisions are complimentary. Articles 301 to 307 provide the conditions required for the fullest enjoyment of the freedom guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (g).

#### Free Trade

Trade: Buying or selling of goods. Commerce: All forms of transportation such as by land, air and water. Intercourse: Movement of goods from one place to another place.

#### *Free Trade, Commerce and Intercourse*

Articles 301 to 307, knit India into a single economic unit. This is possible only when the free movement and exchange of goods throughout the territory of India. Before independence, India was divided into many sovereign regions which was not conducive for free trade. Article 301 aims at removing these barriers and promote the free movement goods.

Article 301, makes the trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India free. The Supreme Court ruled that freedom is not from all laws but from such laws which restrict the activities of trade and commerce. It grants freedom from laws which go beyond regulations which burdens, restricts or prevents the free trade movements between states and within states.<sup>[14]</sup>

#### *Restrictions on Free Trade, Commerce and Intercourse*

The free trade between one state and another can be restricted by the law of the Parliament on the ground of public interest (Article 302). The ground of restriction is same as for the right to profession guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (g). This power is vested in the Parliament in order to avoid any restriction being imposed parochial grounds and political reasons by the states.

According to Article 303, neither the Parliament nor the state legislature can make any law which may discriminate between states with respect to the free trade. It prohibits any discrimination or preferential treatment to any state. However, the Parliament has the powers to give preference for any state or any region when the state or the region is facing scarcity of the goods [Article 303 (2)].

Article 304, empowers the state to impose reasonable restrictions on the free trade if it is required in the general public interest. But the bill has to be introduced in the state legislature only with the previous recommendation of the President.

The states enact law to impose any tax on goods imported from other states or the Union Territories (UTs) to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that state are subjected. The tax is imposed to avoid discrimination between goods imported in to and goods manufactured or produced in the state.

#### *Exemption*

Any law providing for state monopoly on any trade, commerce or profession is immunized from Articles 301and 303.

# Article 20: Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences

Article 20 extends protection in matters relating to conviction for an offence. It provides for three kinds of protection namely protection against:

- 1. Retrospective law: Article 20 (1)
- 2. Double Jeopardy: Article 20 (2)
- 3. Self-incriminating evidence: Article 20 (3)

## *Article 20 (1)*

It primarily provides for the protection against the retrospective laws. According to Article 20 (1), any person can be punished only for the violation of law. The law which is violated must be in force when the offence was committed. The punishment must not exceed the one prescribed the law which is said to have been violated. To sum up, Article 20 (1) implies that:

- Any act committed violating a law is an offence.
- To be counted as an offence, the law said to be violated must be in force at the time when the act was committed.
- A law must not be given retrospective effect. That is, any act must not be declared as an offence by a law passed after the act was committed. However, the condition applies only for a criminal law. A civil law can be given a retrospective effect.
- The punishment for the offence must not exceed beyond what is prescribed in the law.

#### Meaning

Offence: An act of violating a law in force.

Double jeopardy: Prosecuting and punishing a person for the same offence more than once. Ex post facto law: A law which is given a retrospective force.

## *Double Jeopardy*

Article 20 (2) reads that 'no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once'. Prosecuting and punishing a person for the same offence more than once is known as 'double jeopardy'. According to Supreme Court, for the protection of Article 20 (2) is available:

- There must have been committed an offence.
- There must have been a prosecution initiated against the person in a court of law.
- The court convicting the person for the offence and punished by the court.
- A prosecution is initiated against the person again in the court.

## *Disciplinary Proceedings Not Double Jeopardy*

In case a person, who had committed an offence, is prosecuted and punished by a court of law, is dismissed from service on the ground of conviction, then should it be considered as double jeopardy? Will the protection of Article 20 (2) be available in this case?

The disciplinary proceeding will not be double jeopardy. Only when there occurs 'prosecution and punishment', twice for the same offence, it will be double jeopardy and protection of Article 20 (2) will be

**RA 80** 

available. In case of the disciplinary proceeding, no prosecution takes place. It is only the consequence of the conviction; breach of contract and the person loses the moral ground of continuing in service.

#### *Self-Incriminating Evidence*

Article 20 (3) protects any person from being compelled to give self-incriminating evidence. No person shall be compelled to be a witness in his own case. According to the Supreme Court the protection is available if:

- There was an offence committed.
- The person accused of the offence is compelled to be witness.
- The witness must be against himself.
- The element of compulsion must be present.

However, the protection is available only in case in which a person is compelled to be a witness against himself. In case the witness is not against oneself, then the person can be compelled to give witness before a court. The court has ruled that when a person summoned by the court as a witness he must appear before the court. Failing which the court has the powers to order that he be arrested and produced before the court.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:* (a) State the amplitude of Article 21 of the constitution. *IAS MAINS (1998)*  (b) What are the rights within the ambit of Article 21 of the Indian constitution? *IAS MAINS (2012)*  (c) What is right to life and personal liberty? How have the courts expanded its meaning in recent years? *IAS MAINS (2006)* 

It is to be noted that any object or document recovered from the offender in a search and seizure operation is not to be considered as self-incriminating.

## Article 21: Protection of Life and Personal Liberty

According to Article 21, 'No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law'. Thus, it provides for right to life and personal liberty.

'If read literally, Article 21 is a colourless article and appears to be negative in its grammatical form. But it has been given a positive effect by judicial interpretation. The right is a fundamental right, enforceable against the state; and judicial decisions have imposed, on the state, several positive obligations. It has been included in the constitution as a fundamental right in order to place it beyond the reach of ordinary to legislation inspired by political motives'.<sup>[15]</sup>

### *Right to Life*

This is one of the most widely interpreted provisions and has the maximum amplitude. The Supreme Court has ruled that 'Life', in Article, 21 is not merely the physical act of breathing. According to Indian philosophy, life is lived at many levels. Thus, the right to life is on a right to mere animal existence but a right to live with human dignity. The right includes the life which includes the 'finer graces of human civilization'. The Article 21 is a canopy under which various other rights 'have found shelter, growth and nourishment'. Thus, it has come to include a variety of other rights as 'implied rights'.

<sup>88</sup> A

<sup>15</sup> Observations of the Supreme Court in various cases.

## *Implied Rights*

Implied rights are those rights which are not guaranteed by any provision of the constitution but have been propounded by the court. Any condition or right that takes part in the exercise and enjoyment of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution shall also be a fundamental right. It is irrespective of whether it has been given in the Part III of the constitution or elsewhere in the constitution or even if it is not given in the constitution. Such rights flow as a consequence of the given right and hence are known as implied rights.

Supreme Court virtually rendered this fundamental right a repository of various human rights. Thus, it includes:

- Right to healthy environment which in turn includes the right to pollution-free water and air and protection against hazardous industries
- Free education up to 14 years of age
- Emergency medical aid
- Right to health
- Privacy
- Right to shelter
- Right to livelihood, which includes right of succession
- Timely medical treatment in government hospital
- Right, not to be driven out of a state
- Right to fair trial
- Right to speedy trial
- Right to free legal aid, where conviction for an offence may involve loss of life or personal liberty

Thus, the scope of Article 21 has been expanded. It has resulted in the emergence of various doctrines like doctrine of natural justice, doctrine of public trust,<sup>[16]</sup> etc. It has given scope for the emergence of rights such as the rights of the prisoners and right against torture and inhuman treatment. It has expanded the application of writ of habeas corpus to prisoners serving a sentence if they are subjected to torture by the prison authorities. According to the Supreme Court, an undertrial or convicted prisoner cannot be subjected to a physical or mental restraint which:

- Is not warranted by the punishment awarded by the court.
- Is in excess of the requirements of prisoner's discipline.
- Constitutes human degradation.

The court has also ruled that the right to free legal aid and speedy trial under Article 39A as an integral part of right to life. The court in the Narendra Kumar versus State of Haryana case ruled that 'right to livelihood is an integral facet of the right to life'.

## *Right to Life Versus Right to Die*

The constitution guarantees the right to live by Article 21. It is the right to live until the natural death. It does not include the right not to live and therefore, is not a right to die. Therefore, the right does not include euthanasia and committing suicide.

## *Attempt to Commit Suicide—Not a Crime*

An attempt to commit suicide is regarded as a crime. But this has been challenged in several cases. In the Maruti Shripati Dubal versus State of Maharashtra (1986) case the Bombay High Court held that punishing a person for attempting to commit suicide is unconstitutional. This was later upheld by the Supreme Court also. In 2008, the Law Commission recommended decriminalization of Section 309 of the India Penal Code, saying: 'It is unreasonable to inflict punishment upon a person who, on account of

**...** 

<sup>16</sup> For details refer judiciary chapter.

family discord, destitution, loss of a dear relation or other cause of a like nature, overcomes the interest of self-preservation and decides to take his own life. In such a case, the unfortunate person deserves sympathy, counselling and appropriate treatment, and certainly not prison'. As a result the section 309 of IPC has been deleted and no ore an attempt to commit suicide is an offence.

### *Right to Die with Dignity*

An NGO, Common Cause in 2005 filed a PIL in the Supreme Court pleading for the right to die with dignity especially for the terminally ill patients. The five judge constitutional bench upheld the plea and declared that the right to live with human dignity guaranteed by Article 21 includes the right to die with dignity. The court ruled that 'living will' to constitutional. An individual can make an advance 'living will' authorizing withdrawal of life support systems in case of he falls terminally ill and reaches an irreversible stage of illness. Thus, it is said that the Supreme Court has legalized 'passive euthanasia'. All though euthanasia involves several ethical, legal and emotional issues, the Supreme Court has made it legal and an implied fundamental right.

### *Right to Privacy*

Black's law dictionary defines privacy as 'the right to be let alone; the right of a person to be free from any unwarranted publicity; the right to live without any unwarranted interference by the public in matters with which the public is not necessarily concerned'. The Constitution of India does not expressly guarantee the right to privacy as a fundamental right. But the Supreme Court, interpreted Article 21 in conformity with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and declared that right to privacy is implied in right to life.<sup>[17]</sup>

The court in the Govind versus State of Madhya Pradesh, case further ruled that the privacy as right flows out of Articles 19 (1) (a), 19 (1) (d) and 21. However, it is not an absolute right but subjected to reasonable restrictions. The same view was reiterated by the courts in several other cases.

### *Right to Privacy: Importance*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Examine the scope of fundamental rights in the light of the latest judgement of the Supreme Court on right to privacy. *IAS MAINS (GS PAPER 2) (2017)*

- Right to privacy is an essential component of right to life and personal liberty.
- Without the right to privacy, other rights, especially the freedom of expression and right to liberty cannot survive.
- It is widely viewed that the right to privacy as an aspect of the pursuit of happiness.
- Privacy is important as it upholds certain most fundamental values of human life such as one's personal decisions-making ability, his individuality and dignity.
- Privacy at times is a dimension of safety. For instance, the location of a woman when exposed could endanger her safety. Similarly, the information about one's financial strength could cause safety issues if exposed.
- The individual choices made, especially on the internet could be used by organizations for psychological manipulation. This is noteworthy in the context of targeted marketing practices of the e-commerce websites.

<sup>17</sup> Supreme Court: Kharak Singh vs. State of UP case, 1963 AIR 1295, 1964 SCR (1) 332.
#### *Right to Privacy: Need*

- Each individual needs a private space for undertaking any legal activity within the limits of law.
- Privacy is a special kind of independence which can be understood as an attempt to secure autonomy in at least a few personal and spiritual concerns. This autonomy is the most special thing that the person can enjoy as a truly free man (Clinton Rossiter, American political scientist).
- In a competitive situation privacy helps a person to protect his interest. For example, a player needs privacy to think and strategize considering the competition. A businessman requires privacy to strategize his business moves in a competitive business atmosphere.
- Individuals need privacy to maintain their individuality and utilize the information with them in their own way.
- Privacy is needed for controlling the quality of information which one shares with others.
- Privacy is needed to help an individual to make a self-evaluation, learn and develop.
- Privacy is also needed to develop interpersonal relationships, especially to establish intimate relationships.

## *Right to Privacy Versus Right to Information*

Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh said, 'There is a fine balance required to be maintained between right to information and the right to privacy, which stems out of the fundamental right of life and liberty. The citizen's right to know should definitely be circumscribed if disclosure of information encroaches upon someone's personal privacy. But where to draw a line is a complicated question'.

In the Niira Radia tape case the court ruled that any information would be available to every citizen under the RTI Act except those subjected to Section 8 (J) of RTI Act. Section 8 (J) relates to personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity on interest. However, in case the public authority or the Information Officer is satisfied that the disclosure of such information is required in the larger interest of the public then such information may also be disclosed.

# *Right to Privacy: Supreme Court Judgement*[18]

The Supreme Court in the Justice Puttaswamy case, (2017) ruled that 'privacy' is a fundamental right included in the right to personal liberty. The court ruled, 'Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a core which is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the individual is conditioned by her relationships with the rest of society. Those relationships may and do often pose questions to autonomy and free choice. The overarching presence of state and non-state entities regulates aspects of social existence which bear upon the freedom of the individual'. The important aspects of the judgement are as follows,

To guarantee a dignified life the constitution makes it essential to guarantee the right to life and personal liberty. Right to live with human dignity and these rights are inseparable. According to the court, 'Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a core which is inviolable'. At the core privacy includes the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone.

The right to privacy remains intact even when an individual is in a public place. Being in a public place does not require the individual to surrender his privacy on any ground. However, the right is not an absolute right. Like every other fundamental right, it is subjected to reasonable restrictions. In case any law encroaches upon the right the law will be subjected to the test of reasonableness.

The right is very important in a society like India given its diversity. Therefore, it has to be protected against encroachment by state and non-state actors. That requires recognizing the right as a fundamental right. The right must be guaranteed to every section of the society irrespective of whether it is majority or

<sup>18</sup> Justice K S Puttaswamy (Ret.) vs. Union of India and Others, August, 2017.

miniscule minority. This is all the more essential due to the significant technological changes that have taken place since independence.

#### *Right to Pollution-free Environment: Supreme Court Ruling on Burning Crackers*

The Supreme Court in Subash versus State of Bihar case held that the right to pollution free air falls within Article 21. Also, the court ruled that "any disturbance of the basic environment elements, namely air, water and soil, which are necessary for 'life', would be hazardous to 'life' within the meaning of Article 21 of the constitution".

In this issue the Supreme Court way back in 1998 ruled that no citizen had the right to manufacturing and burning fireworks/crackers that produce noise beyond permissible limits and cause noise pollution.[19] However, manufacturing and burning crackers within the permissible levels of pollution was upheld as a fundamental right under Article 21. In 2005, the court imposed restrictions on burning crackers at night-time. This was imposed as a reasonable restriction because it would affect the rights of other citizens as well.

In 2015, the issue was again brought before the court as the burning crackers during Diwali in Delhi caused severe pollution. Diwali festival falls during winter which aggravates the pollution further due to the fall in wind speed. It was prayed before the court for imposing a ban on burning crackers throughout Delhi. Instead a specific time limit may be prescribed and designate a place for people to burst crackers. The court refused to impose a ban on bursting crackers on the ground that it would be an infringement into the fundamental right to celebrate a festival. This resulted in unprecedented air pollution in Delhi. The haze and smoke caused by the burning of crackers remained suspended for more than a week disrupting the normal life in Delhi.

As a consequence, the matter again came to the court. In November 2016, the court had passed an order imposing a ban on the sale of fireworks—both wholesale and retail, in the NCR region. Further, in July 2017, the court imposed a ban on the use of five chemicals namely, antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic and lead in any form whatsoever in manufacturing the fireworks. These five chemicals are among the most important pollutants.

Subsequently in October 2017, the court has imposed a ban on the sale of firecrackers in the NCR region until November 2017. This is an order upholding the previous order that was passed in September following the order passed in November 2016.

However, the implementation of the said order of the Supreme Court is fraught with many challenges. The following criticisms are placed against this order:

- The ban on sale of fireworks is only for a temporary period. The temporary ban is not logical when the burning of fireworks causing pollution is a permanent problem. So, this temporary ban is not a solution to the problem.
- The court considers this as an experiment but according to Bishwajit Bhattacharyya former Additional Solicitor General such experiments are to be left to the executive because the courts do not have the mechanism to monitor the implementation of the order.
- He also opines that the ban is only on sale and not on burning them. So, when the crackers are burned in the eve of Diwali by those who had already bought it, the order has no effect.
- Similarly, the ban order has not considered the status of the firecrackers that have already been imported and stored. In case those firecrackers are distributed as gift then there is no solace in this order.

The issue of pollution, noise and air pollution caused by burning firecrackers has been alive ever since 1985 when M. C. Mehta filed a writ petition. He pleaded for the intervention of the Supreme Court to regulate the burning of the firecrackers to control pollution. But still the issue remains alive but the solution to the problem evades.

<sup>19</sup> Burra bazar fireworks dealers association vs. the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, AIR 1998.

## *Right to Clean Environment—Does it Entail Legal Regulations on Burning Crackers?*

From the foregoing it is clear that there is a requirement for certain legal regulations in respect of burning crackers during Diwali. Burning crackers is a practice that is prevalent across the globe to mark the celebrations. For instance, firecrackers are part of even the major events like the inauguration ceremony of Olympics.

In India, it is a traditional practice of burning crackers in the eve of Diwali. It is thus, part of citizens' fundamental right to life and also the freedom of religion (right to practice religion). However, the constitution provides these rights subjected to reasonable restrictions. Freedom of religion is subjected to restrictions on the ground of 'public order, morality and health and to the other fundamental rights'. Moreover, the DPSP (Article 48A) entrusts the responsibility of protecting and improving the environment on the state. The Supreme Court also has ruled that the legal measures taken for the implementation of DPSP shall impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights.  $[20]$  Similarly, Article 51A (g) declares the protection of environment as a fundamental duty of every citizen.

So, it may be clearly understood that legal regulations must be enacted by the Parliament and state legislatures. Though the courts have passed orders in this regard, those are found to insufficient and have not been able to resolve the problem permanently. The resolution of the problem requires legal regulations implemented with concrete measures that will educate the people about the importance of protecting the environment and imbibing the values towards achievement of the objective.

## *Right to Personal Liberty*

Article 21 also guarantees the right to personal liberty. According to the dictionary, personal liberty refers to the state of being free, the power to do as one pleases,<sup>[21]</sup> etc. It is a 'state' of being and is not a single right.

# *A. K. Gopalan Case View*

| on English constitutional philosophy'.           | on American constitutional philosophy'.         |

When the communist leader A. K. Gopalan was detained under the Preventive Detention Act, he moved the Supreme Court seeking remedy. He pleaded that he being detained under the Preventive Detention Act was violating his right to personal liberty as guaranteed by Article 21. The personal liberty infringed upon was the right to free movement and therefore, it must be subjected to the test of reasonableness. The right to free movement is guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (d), which may be restricted reasonably on the grounds given in Article 19 (5). Hence, he pleaded that Articles 19 and 21 are related and hence he be granted relief.

<sup>20</sup> Refer in the same chapter the topic under Article 19.

<sup>21</sup> Merriam Webster English dictionary.

However, the Supreme Court refused to accept this view and rejected his plea. The court held that there was no interlink between Articles 19 and 21. The court refused to grant relief on the ground that:

- There was a valid law under which he was detained namely, Preventive Detention Act.
- The law has established a procedure.
- The procedure was followed.

The court had taken the English view of interpreting Article 21. This judgment was subjected to criticism as it effectively protects the citizen from 'executive tyranny,' but does not protect him from the legislative tyranny.

#### *Maneka Gandhi Case View*

This anomaly was set right in the Maneka Gandhi case. In 1977, the Government of India decided to impound Maneka Gandhi's passport in the interest of general public, under the India Passport Act. Maneka Gandhi challenged this in the Supreme Court on the ground that the impounding her passport without providing proper reason was infringing upon her fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21.

The court applied the doctrine of liberal interpretation to construct the meaning of the term 'personal liberty'. The court ruled that the term must be given the widest possible meaning. The rights guaranteed by Article 19 are integral part of personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21. Those are given separately as they are most fundamental and hence need a separate mention.

The Supreme Court in this case reversed its judgment of Gopalan case. The court ruled that Articles 19 and 21 are not watertight compartments and they are to read together. The court ruled that the state may deprive a person of his personal liberty if:

- There is a valid law.
- The law has established a procedure.
- The procedure must be a reasonable procedure.

Thus, the court ruled that there must not only 'a procedure established by law', but the procedure must be a 'due process'. That is, the procedure must withstand the test of reasonableness. The court took the American view of interpreting the phrase 'procedure established by law in Article 21'.

#### Article 21A: Right to Education

This right was part of the original constitution. It was inserted by the Constitution (86th Amendment) Act, 2002. In the original constitution it was part of Article 45 which obliged the state to endeavour to provide free and compulsory education to all children until they completed fourteen years of age.

In spite of this the objective was not achieved even after 50 years of the constitution coming into force. The demand for concrete steps to implement this gained momentum after the National Policy of Education (NPE) was announced in 1986. Although several steps have been taken by the union and the state governments the goal was still at large. To fulfil the objective Article 21A was inserted. The main provisions are:

- (a) Article 21A provides free and compulsory education as a fundamental right to children between the age of 6 and 14 years.
- (b) It needs to read along with Article 51A (k)<sup>(22)</sup> which makes it a fundamental duty of every parent to provide opportunity for education to every child.
- (c) It states that the right will be guaranteed, 'in such manner as the state may, by law, determine'. Subsequently the Right to Education Act has been enacted to implement this.

<sup>22</sup> Article 51A (k): It shall be the duty of every citizen of India who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years: Inserted by the Constitution (86th Amendment) Act, 2002.

## *Criticism*

Though the amendment and the Right to Education Act can be viewed as positive measures towards providing education to all children they are not free of criticism. The critical views are:

While the constitution guarantees the fundamental rights either directly to citizens or as a restriction on the state, this right empowers the state to determine the manner in which the right will be guaranteed. This result is the question of how any child could get the relief in case of violation of this right.

Adding article 51A (k), which makes educating children a fundamental duty of the parent is state shifting its responsibility to the parents. Further, the Right to Education Act 2009 is not free of its own weaknesses.

## Article 22: Protection Against Arrest and Detention in Certain Cases

Articles 22 provides for the protection in case of arrest and detection. It provides for the protection in respect of punitive detention and preventive detention.

### *Punitive Detention*

Punitive detention refers to the detention of any person after being sentenced by a court on a trial for committing an offence. It is to make him serve the punishment. Clauses 1 to 3 of Article 22 provide for the safeguards in respect of punitive detention. According to Article 22:

- 1. Any person arrested must be informed of the cause of arrest.
- 2. He must be allowed to consult a legal practitioner and defend himself against the arrest.
- 3. Once arrested the person must be produced before a judicial magistrate within 24 hours of arrest. This will exclude the time of travel.

#### Enemy Alien

Any person who shows allegiance to or in communication with any country which is at war with India.

Only a competent court of law has the power to declare any person as enemy alien. It is not an executive power.

However, these safeguards are not available in case of a person who is an enemy alien at the time of arrest. Similarly, the protection is by Articles 22 (1) and (2) is not available to any person who is detained under a law providing for preventive detention. This is because the safeguards for preventive detention are separately provided.

## *Preventive Detention*

It means to arrest a person without trial but to prevent him from committing an offence. When the authorities do not have sufficient evidence to prove that a person has committed an offence but have sufficient evidence to prove that he may commit an offence if let free, then the person may be detained. This is known as preventive detention.

Usually, in other democracies preventive detention is not known during normal times. The English constitution provides for preventive detention only at times of emergency. However, the Indian constitution provides for preventive detention even during normal times. This is subjected to severe criticism. The critics are of the view that the constitution pays lip sympathy to fundamental rights. However, these criticisms are far-fetching as Indian conditions are different.

The constitution has provided for the safeguards against preventive detention not in the fashion of recognizing it, but only to limit the power of the state to arrest any person under preventive detention.

n n n

## *Safeguards*

- Any person can be detained under preventive detention only for a period of three months.
- In case the detention is to be more than three months then it has to be approved by an advisory board.
- The advisory board is comprised of judges of high court or retired judges of high court or persons qualified to be appointed as a judge of high court.
- The board may grant the extension of the detention in case there was sufficient cause and the law under which the person is detained must provide for such extension.
- When a person is subjected to preventive arrest, he must be informed of the cause of arrest. However, if the authority detaining a person has sufficient reasons that the disclosure of the cause of arrest would adversely affect the interest of the nation then the cause need not be disclosed. The reasons for non-disclosure must be recorded in writing and submitted to the magistrate before who the person is produced.
- The person must be provided the earliest opportunity to make representation against the order of preventive detention.

## *Supreme Court Direction on Arrest: D. K. Basu Case*

- 1. Police arresting and interrogating suspects should wear 'accurate, visible and clear' identification and name-tags, and details of interrogating police officers should be recorded in a register.
- 2. A memo of arrest must be prepared at the time of arrest. The memo must:
  - Have the time and date of arrest.
  - Be attested by at least one witness who may either be a family member of the person arrested or a respectable person of the locality where the arrest was made.
  - Be countersigned by the person arrested.
- 3. The person must be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest.
- 4. He must not be ill-treated or tortured during arrest or in custody.

# Right Against Exploitation (Articles 23 and 24)

Exploitation and Discrimination

Exploitation: To takes unfair advantage of any person.

Discrimination: Treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction in favour of or against, a person.

The right against exploitation is related to the right against discrimination, right to equality and right to personal liberty. Article 23 prohibits trafficking in human beings and forced labour. It also prohibits the practice of 'begar'. Begar is an indigenous practice in which the landlords compel the tenants to provide certain services free of cost. Thus, the article prohibits trafficking in human beings, beggar and other similar forms of forced labour.

A forced is one in which an individual is compelled to render a service free of cost though he has either the right not to render the service or he is entitled to a remuneration for the services. However, even if remuneration is paid for the labour still, if it is 'forced', then it is unconstitutional.[23] The Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act was enacted towards implementing Article 23.

However, the prohibition is not absolute. According to Article 23 (2), the state can impose any compulsory service on the citizens for a public purpose. For example, when the public servants engaged in public services like election or census, etc., it will not be regarded as violation of Article 23. According to the Supreme Court, what is prohibited is compelling a person to render a gratuitous service.

Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in factories, mines and other hazardous employment. Unlike Article 23, the prohibition under Article 24 is absolute. However, the family business and traditional employment are exempted from being counted as hazardous employment.
