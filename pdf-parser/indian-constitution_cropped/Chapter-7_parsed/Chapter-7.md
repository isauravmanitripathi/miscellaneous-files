# INTRODUCTION RIGHT TO EQUALITY

Right to equality is guaranteed by Articles 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. The peculiar problems and characteristic features of India demanded dealing with equality in detail and elaborately.

# Article 14: Right to Equality

'The source of Article 14 lies in the American and the Irish constitutions. It may be mentioned that the Preamble to the Indian constitution speaks of equality of status and of opportunity and this article gives effect to that principle in the text of the constitution. In a sense, the demand for equality is linked-up with the history of the freedom movement in India. Indians wanted the same rights and privileges that their British masters enjoyed in India and the desire for civil rights was implicit in the formation of the Indian National Congress in  $1885.^{(1)}$ Hence, Article 14 is considered the principle that forms the basis for all the other fundamental rights. Article 14 contains two parts namely, equality before law and equal protection of law. Plainly looked both look identical but are distinct from each other. According to Supreme Court, in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India case, Right to Equality forms one of the basic features of the constitution and cannot be taken away.

#### Do You Know?

The essence of Rule of Law is: Absence of arbitrary power or supremacy of the law.

- Equality before law.
- The constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land.

# *Equality Before Law*

It conforms to Dicey's concept of Rule of Law. It implies that the no person shall be granted any privilege on the ground of birth, creed or the life. It also prevents any preferential treatment favouring anyone. It implies a complete absence of discrimination. It is negative in its effect. Equality before law is a corollary of the Rule of Law. Thus, it declares that:

- All persons are equal.
- The law is supreme and above any person irrespective of his social, financial, political or any other status.
- Every person is amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals, irrespective his rank or status.

However, the concept does not propound absolute equality. What is guaranteed is not identical treatment but similarity of treatment. The concept permits discrimination based on proper rationality. Parliament needs to apply its experience and judgement in classification for conferring benefits to a particular group. Such reasons which form the basis of the special treatment must withstand the test under Article 14.

# *Exceptions to Article 14*

The constitution, by Article 361, grants exception to President of India and the Governors of states from Article 14. According to Article 361:

- 1. The President, or the Governor of a state, shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties.
- 2. No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the President, or the Governor of a state, in any court during his term of office.
- 3. President, or the Governor of a state cannot be imprisoned on any ground and the courts must not issue any warrant to arrest the President or the Governor of a state.
- 4. Any civil proceedings may be instituted against the President, or the Governor of a state, during his term of office in any court in respect of any act done or purporting to be done by him in his personal capacity only if:
  - A notice in writing has been delivered to the President or the Governor two months in advance.
  - The notice must contain the nature of the proceedings, the cause of action therefore, the name, description and place of residence of the party by whom such proceedings are to be instituted.

Apart for the President and the Governor of the state, the following persons are also granted immunity from Article 14:

- No criminal or civil proceedings can be instituted against the rulers of foreign countries and their ambassadors in India.
- The United Nations and its agencies are entitled to diplomatic immunity.
- Members of Parliament and of state legislatures are not liable in respect of anything done or said within the House<sup> $(2)$ </sup> (Articles 105 and 194).

# Equal Protection of Law

It is a positively worded concept. Ivor Jennings, an expert in the constitutional law, puts forth the view that 'Equal protection of law', implies that among equals, the law should be equal and equally administered, that is likes should be treated alike. It means every person being subjected to 'equality of treatment in equal circumstances'.

| <b>Right to Equality</b>                                                        |                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>Equality before law</b>                                                      | <b>Equal protection of law</b>                                           |
| • Negative in application.<br>• Manifests as rule of law and promotes equality. | • Positive in application.<br>• Manifests as justice and upholds equity. |

In other words, it means the right of being treated equally in similar circumstances both in conferring the privileges and in imposing the liabilities by the laws. The basic premise of equality of treatment is that persons who are equally circumstanced shall be treated equally. Persons who are unequally circumstanced should not be treated equally. It means 'the like shall be treated alike and the unalike shall not be treated alike'. Therefore, no one must be extended any favour or preferentially treated nor anyone must be subjected to any disadvantage without any reasonable justification.

Thus, it permits policies like differential taxation and reservation. Not every person shall be taxed equally but only such persons under 'same character shall be taxed by the same standard'. Hence, the Article 14 permits classification of people for the purpose of law or implementation of a policy. The principle does not take away from the state the power of classifying persons for legitimate purposes.<sup>[5]</sup> However, such classification must be 'reasonable' and must be directly related to the purpose of law/ policy.

Thus, 'equal protection' guarantees equal treatment of persons in 'equal circumstances', and permits differentiation, not discrimination in different circumstances. 'The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have universal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or circumstance, in the same position as the varying needs of different classes of persons often requires separate treatment.<sup>'(4)</sup>

According to the Supreme Court the basis of classification may be:

- Geographical
- Difference in time
- Difference in the nature trade or occupation to regulated

In effect, equal protection of law emphasizes on equity. The access to resources and benefits must be granted to all in a just, fair and equitable manner and transparently. In a modern civil society, rule of law is the cardinal principle of governance. This applies to the distribution of the benefits of the state schemes also. The distribution of such benefits must be protected against nepotism and vested interest. To quote the Supreme Court, 'The act of governance has to withstand the test of judiciousness and impartiality and avoid arbitrary or capricious actions.'

# Article 15: Right Against Discrimination

Article 15 provides for the right against discrimination. Any traditional society is organized on the basis of a hierarchy and Indian society is no exception. Hence, a mere declaration of equality in general is not enough. Such hierarchy results in a sort of discrimination. The discrimination manifests as certain

<sup>4</sup> Supreme Court: Dhirendhra vs Legal Remembrancer case (1954 AIR 424, 1955 SCR 224) and Sarbananda Sonowal vs Union of India Case (AIR 2005 SC 2920).

![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)

conditions or constraints or disqualifications imposed on a section of the society upon exercising their right. Article 15 seeks to address this.

Article 15 (1) prohibits the state from discriminating any citizen 'on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them'. Article 15 (2) reads 'No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subjected to any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to:

- Access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment.
- The utilization of wells, tanks, bathing *ghats*, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of state funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.'

While Article 15 (1) is a prohibition imposed on the state, Article 15 (2) is imposed on both the state and the private individuals. That is, in case of any infringement of the right by the state then constitutional remedy, against the state, under Article 32 is available. Similarly, by Article 15 (2), in case of any discrimination by a private individual also the constitutional remedy under Article 32 is available.

#### **Connect**

- Discrimination refers to the unequal treatment or unfair treatment based on certain extraneous characteristics.
- Preferential treatment refers to giving priority to one person over others based on certain extraneous characteristics.

#### *Significance of the Term 'Grounds Only of' and 'or Any of Them'*

The constitutional remedy is guaranteed available when the discrimination is on anyone of the grounds given in Article 15. In case the discrimination was on any ground other than those given Article 15, no constitutional remedy is available. For instance, if the state prohibits recruiting women in the frontline combat force or reserve job of nurse to women, it is not discrimination. Here the differential treatment is not on the ground of gender alone but more due to the physical and intellectual fitness.

The phrase 'or any of them' is also significant. It means that any act is discriminatory if it is based on anyone of the grounds mentioned in Article 15. The presence of anyone ground is enough for the court to grant relief and it is not necessary for all the grounds to be present.

#### *Is the Caste Discrimination in India, Racial Discrimination?*

In the World Conference against Racism held in Durban in September 2001, some of the *Dalit* activists raised the issue of discrimination against *Dalit* in India as racial discrimination. However, the government of India opposed this move on the ground that the discrimination in India is more a caste-based discrimination and it must not be considered as racial discrimination. While racial discrimination is based on the morphological features such as the stature, skin complexion, etc., discrimination in India is more on the basis of caste, which is an ascriptive value. Caste is inherited from the father and the discrimination in India is based on the birth not on the appearance.

Further, the discrimination in India is practised in a hierarchy as the conditions, constraints and the disqualifications are imposed on every caste in the hierarchy. But the *Dalits* being at the lower most rung of the hierarchy are the most affected. The conditions, and constraints imposed on they exercising the rights and the disqualifications to which they are subject is unacceptable. Hence, the caste-based discrimination in India is not similar to the racial discrimination practised in any other country in the world.

#### *Exception to Article 15*

According to Article 15 (3), the state is empowered to make any special provision for the development of women and children. In case such measures provide for a differential treatment to women and children, they shall not be unconstitutional.

Similarly, Article 15 (4), provides the 'special protection' to 'socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes'. This clause (4) was inserted by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act 1951. The amendment was made to enable the implementation of reservation in public employment guaranteed by Article 16 (4). It enables the state to discriminate positively (Positive Discrimination) in order to formulate and achieve the welfare of the people. Such discrimination is not considered unconstitutional.

The Constitution (93 Amendment) Act, 2005 inserted Article 15 (5). This clause empowers the state to enact law to extend the reservation relating to admission to educational institutions, in favour of backward classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. However, this is not applicable to any educational institution established by a linguistic or religious minority.<sup>[5]</sup>

### Article 16: Right to Equal Opportunity in Matters of Public Employment

Article 16 provides for the right to equality of opportunity to all citizens of India in public employment. To guarantee the fundamental right to equality of opportunity and employment in public offices is the central objective of Article 16. This right is guaranteed only to citizens and not available to any other person. Further, it is applicable only to employment or appointment to an office 'under the state'.

According to Article 16 (2), 'Citizens of India must not be disqualified or declared ineligible to any public employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them'. The phrases 'on the grounds only of' and 'or any of them' have the significance as they had for Article 15.

The constitution specifies these grounds because in Indian society the occupation was largely determined by the caste to which a person belongs. As a matter of tradition, women were declared ineligible to several employment activities outside the accepted practices. Religion had been a ground on which people were subjected to discrimination. However, Article 16 (5) provides that 'the incumbent of an

<sup>5</sup> Refer Article 30 for details

office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination'.

'Descent' has been included in the ground in order to prevent caste as a basis of recruitment must not be indirectly included. Place of birth and residence is also included in the grounds. Since constitution provides for single citizenship and the right to practice any profession throughout the territory of India, place of birth and residence must not be a qualification requirement.

However, residence may be a necessary qualification in case of certain posts. In such cases, the power to prescribe the residence as qualification is vested in the Parliament and the states do not have the power to make rules in this regard [Article 16 (3)]. This is intended to avoid the recruitment being influenced by any parochial tendency. The selection test must uniform throughout India. This implies that the state can prescribe qualifications necessary for employment which is not unconstitutional. The qualifications may relate to physical fitness, loyalty to state, integrity, etc. The state is also empowered to conduct selection tests on the basis of which the candidate may be graded and selected. Here, the only condition is that the test must not arbitrary and uniform to all qualified candidates.

The Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 was enacted under Article 16 (3). In the state of Andhra Pradesh and in the Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura, for employment to certain posts and services, residence as condition for employment in certain posts and services was prescribed by the law. When the act expired in 1974, Article 371 (D) was inserted by 32 amendment. Article 371 (D) is the special provision for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana 'having regard to the requirement of each state for equitable opportunities and facilities for the people belonging to different parts of such state, in the matter of public employment and in the matter of education, and different provisions may be made for various parts of the states'.<sup>[6]</sup>

#### Theory of Justice

- Reservation given in Article 16 (4) is the operational concept of the equal protection of law guaranteed by Article 14.
- It reflects the theory of justice propounded by John Rawls
- According to the theory:
  - 1. Every person in a society is entitled to the same liberties as every other person is entitled.
  - 2. When there is a conflict between achieving equity and maintaining equality, the latter (equality) shall be compromised to guarantee equity. Once equity is achieved, social justice is ensured and equality will be automatically restored.

#### *Article 16 (4): Reservation*

Reservation in matters of employment is guaranteed by Article 16 (4). It reads that 'Nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the services under the state.'

Reservation is important 'in a country where there are different strata of society ranging from highly sophisticated to lowly backward the concept of equality will drive the latter to the wall. Their condition would become worse than what it is. So, in order to give a real opportunity to them to compete with the better placed people'<sup>(7)</sup> reservation is quaranteed by Article 16 (4). Article 14, provides for 'equal protection of law' which forms the basis of reservation.

<sup>6</sup> Article 371 D

<sup>7</sup> Supreme Court: Trilok Nath vs State of Jammu and Kashmir AIR, 1, SCR (1) 103, 1969.
![](0__page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

However, reservation policy could not be implemented as Article 15 prohibits any discrimination on the ground of caste. In 1951, the then Madras government passed an order to reserve seats in educational institutions in favour of various communities. The order was invalidated by the Supreme Court in the Champakam Dorairajan versus state of Madras. Overriding this judgement, Constitution (First Amendment) was enacted in 1951.

The amendment inserted Article 15 (4), which provided for the concept of 'Special Protection'. By this, the state is empowered to positively discriminate citizens in order to promote and implement the welfare policies such as reservation policy. As a consequence, reservation policy was implemented by which 15% of the seats in the public employment were reserved in favour of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes (STs). This in turn, triggered the demand for reservation by the backward classes other than SCs and STs. However, the demand was not conceded immediately.

Subsequently, in 1953, Kaka Kalelkar Commission was appointed to inquire into the demand. The commission submitted its report in 1955. According to the commission, the causes of educational backwardness amongst the educationally and backward communities were:

- Traditional apathy for education on account of social and environmental conditions or occupational handicaps.
- Poverty and lack of educational institutions in rural areas.
- Living in inaccessible areas.

The report listed 2399 castes as backward castes and 837 among the 2399 as 'most backward'. However, the report was not implemented.

Later in 1979, the Morarji Desai government appointed the 'Backward Classes Commission' under the chairmanship of B. P. Mandal. The Mandal Commission submitted its report in 1980 recommending reservation in favour of the backward classes other than the SCs and the STs. The report was not implemented immediately and was kept in freeze.

In 1990, the then Prime Minister, V. P. Singh announced that the government accepted the Mandal Report and implemented the 27% reservation for the OBCs at all levels of the central government jobs and services. This resulted in the anti-reservation protest and a case was filed against reservation in the Supreme Court – Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case.

### *Mandal Commission Case*[8]

The Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney's case (popularly known as the Mandal Commission case) ruled that:

- 1. Reservation in the matter of employment guaranteed in Article 16 (4) is constitutional and covers the backward classes also.
- 2. Article 16 (4) confers a discretionary power on the state to make reservation. But reservation is not constitutional right of the backward classes.
- 3. 'Backward Class' is not identified by the constitution. But a lower caste can be considered as backward class as caste, occupation, poverty and social backwardness are integrated to each other. 'A caste may by itself constitute a class.' Identification of backward classes is subjected to judicial review.
- 4. The term 'backwardness' for the purpose of Article 16 (4) is mainly social and need not both social and educational as contemplated in Article 15 (4).
- 5. Those who have income above that limit to be fixed by the state are referred to as the 'cream layer'. Income or the extent of property can be taken as a measure of social advancement and on that basis the 'creamy layer' of a given caste can be excluded.
- 6. Backward classes who are not adequately represented in the services under the state are eligible for reservation.
- 7. The reservations in any given year must not exceed 50 % of the total vacancies for the year and should not be related to the total strength of the class, service or cadre, etc.
- 8. Reservation under Article 16 (4) is confined to initial appointment only and cannot extend to providing reservation in the matters of promotion.

#### *Reservation and Article 335*

Although, Article 16(4) does not expressly impose any limitation on upon the power of reservation, it needs to be read along with Article 335. Article 335 reads 'the claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of the administration.' Hence the constitution requires the state to ensure that reservation does not compromise quality.

However, this does not take away the power of the state to prescribe any standard of evaluation that is lower than those applied to others in favour of the members of the SC and ST.

#### *Reservation in Matters of Promotion*

After the Mandal Commission case judgement, the demand for providing reservation in matters of promotion in favour of the SCs and STs was made. The employment under the state at any level will not in any way alter the social status of a person belonging to SC or ST community or increase his ability to compete with other belonging to upper caste. Therefore, reservation in matters of promotion favouring SCs and STs must be granted.

Since the Supreme Court has ruled that reservation must be confined to first level of recruitment only, it required a constitutional amendment. Subsequently, the Constitution (77 Amendment) Act, 1995 was enacted. The amendment inserted Article 16 (4A), which provided for reservation in matters of promotion in favour of SC and ST. The Constitution (85 Amendment) Act, 2001 provided for the 'reservation in promotion with the consequential seniority'.

<sup>8</sup> Supreme Court: (Mandal Commission case) Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case AIR 1993 SC 477, 1992 Supp 2 SCR 454.

## *Consequential Seniority*

'Consequential seniority' is judicially evolved concepts to control the extent of reservation. The source of these concepts is in service jurisprudence. In case a person gets promoted to the next higher level from the level in which he is at present due to the reservation policy under Article 16 (4A), then he may be occupying a senior position in the department which could be possible for a person without reservation to attain only after few more years of service. Thus, such a person gains seniority in service due to the reservation in promotion. However, this was challenged in the Nagraj case on the grounds that:

- It is destructive of the efficiency of administration inasmuch as by this means the higher echelons of administration would be occupied entirely by members of reserved categories.
- Giving consequential seniority in addition to accelerated promotion constituted conferment of double benefit upon the members of the reserved category.
- It would result in reverse discrimination in the percentage of representation of the reserved category officers in the higher cadre.

However, the court ruled that it cannot be said that by insertion of the concept of 'consequential seniority' the structure of Article 16 (1) stands destroyed or abrogated.

# *Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000*

The amendment inserted Article 16 (4B). This clause provides that the seats reserved for the SC and ST must remain vacant in case adequate number of eligible candidates was not found. Such unfilled vacancies must be treated as separate class of vacancies to be filled in any succeeding year. If needed a special recruitment drive must be conducted to fill those vacancies.

## *Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014*[9]

The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 is replaced by the bill. The bill covers 19 conditions of disabilities whereas the existing law covers only seven disabilities specified.

- The bill guarantees the persons with disabilities, the right to equality, life with dignity and respect for his or her integrity equally with others. The bill makes it an obligation to the governments to ensure that the right to live in community of disabled persons. The disabled persons must not be obliged to live in any particular living arrangement.
- The bill provides for certain benefits such as reservations in education and employment, preference in government schemes, etc. to persons with at least 40% of a disability.
- The rights and entitlements conferred on the disabled persons by the bill include friendly access to all public buildings, hospitals, modes of transport, polling stations, etc.
- The bill provides for two types of guardians for a mentally ill person namely, a limited guardian and a plenary guardian. The District Courts is empowered to award a mentally ill person who is incapable of taking care of him. A limited guardian takes decisions jointly with the mentally ill person. A plenary guardian takes decisions on behalf of the mentally ill person, without consulting him.
- The bill prescribes a punishment of imprisonment up to six months, and/or fine of  $\bar{\tau}10,000$  for the violation of any provision of the act.
- The bill prescribes that the Election Commission of India and the State Election Commissions shall ensure that all polling stations are accessible to persons with disabilities and all materials related to the electoral process are easily understandable by and accessible to them.
- The bill makes it an obligation of the state to take specific measures to promote and facilitate inclusive education.

## Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability

Article 17 reads that 'Untouchability' is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law.' However, the constitution does not define the term untouchability. Several members in the constituent assembly debates highlighted this and demanded that it be defined. According to Srijut Rohini Kumar Chaudhury, 'Untouchability' means any act committed in exercise of discrimination on, grounds of religion, caste or lawful vocation of life mentioned in clause 4 of Article  $15$ .<sup> $(10)$ </sup>

In Indian society untouchability refers to the practice of imposing social restrictions to a section of people with respect to 'sharing food, access to public places, offering prayers and performing religious services, entry in temple and other public places and denial of access to drinking water, sources, etc.'<sup>(11)</sup>

'The principal object of Article 17 is to ban the practice of untouchability in any form. This expression refers to the social disabilities imposed on certain classes of persons by reason of their birth in certain caste and does not cover social boycott based on conduct. $(12)$  Abolition of untouchability is essential for achieving equality. Establishing 'equality to status and of opportunity' as declared by the constitution requires the abolition of untouchability.

#### **Connect**

- Untouchability refers to the social practice of enforcing religious disabilities, social disabilities or refusing to sell goods or render services.
- Exclusion, humiliation-subordination and exploitation are the three dimensions of untouchability.

## Article 18: Abolition of Titles

Article 18 prohibits the state from conferring any title on any person. However, this prohibition is only upon the conferring any title in general and not on conferring military or academic titles. It also prohibits the citizens of India accepting any title from any foreign state. In case, a citizen of India is conferred with a title by any foreign state, then he shall accept the title only with the previous consent of the President of India.

The prohibition is imposed on any person who is a foreign national who holds an office of profit or trust under the state, Government of India or any state or any public sector. Even such a person can accept the title from a foreign state only with the previous consent of the President of India.

Conferring title is inherently undemocratic. Further, conferring title on any person might be influenced by political interest or motive of the party in power. This will result in unduly recognizing a person who may deserve such recognition. Thus, it could be ridden by favouritism and corruption. According to Sardar Patel, 'The title is often being abused for corrupting the public life of the country, and, therefore, it is better that it should be provided in the Fundamental Rights.'<sup>(13)</sup> Dr. Ambedkar opined that every citizen of India is duty-bound by the constitution in not accepting any title or using such titles conferred on him to claim any special entitlement or distinguished social status.

#### *Titles and Awards (Honour)*

By this the constitution does not the state from bestowing an award or an honour on citizens recognizing his excellence in any field. Title and honours are different. 'A title is something that hangs to one's

name.<sup> $(14)$ </sup> In this respect the state confers awards such as Padma Awards and Bharat Ratana. The awardees enjoy a superior status and this is even recognized by the warrant of precedence.

These awards were instituted by the notification of the President in 1954. According to the notification, 'any person without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex shall be eligible for the medal'.<sup>[15]</sup> There had been objections to the conferment of these awards on the ground that it is violating Article 18. Further, this amounts to make a comparative evaluation of merits of person who excelled in two altogether different fields. Such comparative evaluation is not practicable and may not be objective. Hence conferring such awards was opposed. Subsequently, the Janata government discontinued the awards. Later, in 1980 the awards were revived.

Later in the Balaji Raghavan versus Union of India case (1997), the conferring of the awards was challenged on the ground that it is an infringement of equality as they are being conferred on undeserving persons. The Supreme Court ruled that the National Awards do not violate the principle of equality as they do not amount to 'titles' for the purpose of Article 18. Recognizing merit does not conflict with the principle of equality. Since then the awards are conferred on the meritorious persons.
