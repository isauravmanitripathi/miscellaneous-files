# INTRODUCTION

Jammu and Kashmir has been formed as a part of the 'Territory of India' under Article 1 and included as the fifteenth State in the First Schedule of the constitution. In the original constitution, Jammu and Kashmir was specified as a 'Part B' State. However, the State was accorded a 'distinctive position' having regard to the circumstances in which the State acceded to India.

The Government of India had declared that it was the people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir were to finally determine the constitution of the State and the jurisdiction of the Union of India. Towards this, a Constituent Assembly of the State was to be formed. Hence, the applicability of the provisions of the constitution with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, were to be in the nature of an interim arrangement. This was incorporated as the substance of the provision embodied in Article 370 of the Constitution of India.

Although the States Reorganization Act, 1956, abolished the category of Part B States, the special constitutional position which Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed under the original constitution (Article 370) has been maintained. Hence, all the constitutional provisions relating to the States in the First Schedule are not applicable with respect to Jammu and Kashmir.

#### Jammu and Kashmir: Controversies

- • Since independence Pakistan believes that Kashmir was to be part of Pakistan.
- People of Kashmir valley have very strong political aspirations relating to their regional identity.
- • They fear losing the *Kashmiriyat* identity being part of India or Pakistan.

## JAMMU AND KASHMIR: INTEGRATION WITH INDIA

To have a proper understanding of the 'special status' granted to the State, it is necessary to understand the development of the constitutional relationship of the State with India retrospectively.

Before Indian independence, Jammu and Kashmir was ruled by a hereditary Maharaja as a Princely State in British India. On the 26 October 1947, the state was attacked by Azad Kashmir Forces with the support of Pakistan. As a consequence, the Maharaja (Sir Hari Singh) was forced to seek the help of India and signed an Instrument of Accession. Consequently, India acquired the jurisdiction with respect to the subjects of 'Defence, External Affairs and Communications' of the State.

By the Accession the dominion of India acquired jurisdiction over the State with respect to the subjects of Defence, External Affairs and Communications. This is similar to the jurisdiction of the Government of India over other Indian States which survived as political units at the time of the making of the Constitution of India. Hence, the State of Jammu and Kashmir was included as a Part B State in the First Schedule of the Constitution of India, as it was promulgated in 1950.

### Accession to India: Implications

It may be well understood that the 'distinctive circumstances' in which Jammu and Kashmir was acceded to India necessitates its 'distinctive position' in the constitution. However, the misconception and misinterpretation of this position requires due definition and description of the legal implications of the Accession of the State to India.

- The Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh was in the same form as was executed by the rulers of several other Princely States which had acceded to India following the enactment of the Indian Independence Act, 1947. Hence, the legal consequences of the execution of the Instrument of Accession, by the ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, are not in any way different from the case of the other Indian States.
- Under Section 7(1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the paramountcy of the British over the Indian States lapsed. Hence, the Princely States had become absolutely sovereign and the rulers of the Indian States had the power to decide on acceding to either India or Pakistan.
- Therefore, by the Act of Accession the State of Jammu and Kashmir became a part of the territory of India 'legally and irrevocably'. Also, the Instrument of Accession granted the jurisdiction with respect to those matters over Jammu and Kashmir, as contained in the Instrument of Accession.

In spite of this, the State was given 'an assurance that the Accession or the constitutional relationship between India and the State would be subjected to confirmation by the people of the State by the Government of India'. This is an extralegal assurance given by the Government of India on a goodwill basis. Thus, the position makes it crystal clear that no third-party other can interfere, taking advantage that the legal procedure of the State acceding to India had not been completed.

# ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION: APPLICATION TO THE STATE OF THEIR OWN FORCE

When Indian Constitution was made in 1949, the grant of special status to Jammu and Kashmir was accommodated in the framework of that constitution. It is natural that the 'distinctive position' of the state has to be represented with necessary provisions in the constitution.

The Constituent Assembly unequivocally gave legal effect to the Act of Accession by declaring Jammu and Kashmir a part of the territory of India (Article 1). Hence, Article 1 of the Indian constitution applies to the State of its own force.

However, the application of the other provisions of the Constitution of India to Jammu and Kashmir was placed on a tentative basis, subjected to the eventual approval of the Constituent Assembly of the State.

#### Schedule 1

Entry 15: The territory which immediately before the commencement of the constitution was comprised in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The constitution thus, provided that the only Articles of the Constitution which would apply of their own force to Jammu and Kashmir were —Articles 1 and 370. The application of the other articles was to be determined by the President in consultation with the Government of the State (Article 370).

According to Article 370 (1), the legislative powers of Parliament over the State is confined to those items of the Union and Concurrent Lists as correspond only to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession.

According to Article 370 (3), the President may, by public notification, declare that this article shall cease to be operative or shall be operative only with such exceptions and modifications and from such date as he may specify. However, the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of the State shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification.

# The Constitution Order

In 1950, the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order was made by the President 1950 in consultation with the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. As specified in the order the Parliament of India was vested with the power to enact laws relating to the three subjects of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications with respect to which Jammu and Kashmir.

Subsequently, in June, 1952 the Delhi Agreement was made between the Government of India and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. The agreement dealt with the subjects over which the Indian Government should have jurisdiction over the State, while the decision of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir was pending.

In 1954, the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir ratified both the Accession to India and the decision made in the Delhi Agreement regarding the future relationship with India. As a sequel the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 was made by the President, in consultation with the State Government. This order came into force on the 14 May 1954.

On being ratified by the Constituent Assembly, the order implemented the Delhi Agreement and also superseded the order of 1950. According to this order, the jurisdiction of the union extended to all union subjects under the Constitution of India (subjected to certain slight alterations) instead of only the three subjects of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications with respect to which the State had acceded to India in 1947.

This order, as amended in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1972, 1974 and 1986, deals with the entire constitutional position of the State within the framework of the Constitution of India, excepting only the internal constitution of the State Government, which was to be framed by the Constituent Assembly of the State.

# MAKING OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION

The Constituent Assembly of the State was elected and first met on 31 October 1951. The Constituent Assembly enacted the first official act that brought the hereditary rule of the Maharaja to an end.

Subsequently, the Maharaja invited Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, President of the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, to form an interim Government, and to carry on the administration of the State which later became the full-fledged Cabinet, with Sheikh Abdullah as the first Prime Minister.

The Jammu and Kashmir Cabinet demanded Maharaja Hari Singh to step down. Maharaja Hari Singh abdicated throne in June 1949 and his son Yuvaraj Karan Singh was elected as the 'Sadar-i-Riyasat' by the Constituent Assembly of the State. Thus, the head of the State was henceforth to be an elected person.

| Jammu Kashmir National Front (JKNF)                              | Nayeem Ahmad Khan     |

In November, 1951, the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution (Amendment) Act was enacted. The Act recognized to the transfer of power from the hereditary Maharaja to the popular government headed by an elected Sadar-i-Riyasat.

In November 1952, the President made a Declaration under Article 370 (3) accepting the position. Thus, the 'Government' of the State of Jammu and Kashmir came to mean the Sadar-i- Riyasat of Jammu and Kashmir, acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers of the State. Subsequently the name of Sadar-i-Riyasat has been changed to that of Governor.

The Constituent Assembly appointed committees to make different aspects of the constitution. The Drafting Committee presented the Draft Constitution in October 1956. After due discussion, it was finally adopted on 17 November 1957. It came into force on 26 January 1957. Thus, the State of Jammu and Kashmir became the only State to have a separate constitution for its administration instead of being administered by the provisions of Part VI of the Constitution of India.

#### Important Provisions of the State Constitution

- The constitution declares that the State of Jammu and Kashmir is 'an integral part of Union of India'.
- The composition of territory of the State will include all the territories, which, on 15 August 1947, were under the sovereignty or suzerainty of the Ruler of the State (i.e., including the Pakistan occupied area of Jammu and Kashmir). And this feature cannot be amended.
- The executive and legislative power of the State will extend to all matters except those with respect to which Parliament has powers to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India.
- In other states, the head of the State executive was called 'Governor' and he is appointed by the President (Articles 152 and 155), but the executive head of the State of Jammu and Kashmir was called Sadar-i-Riyasat (Governor) and he was to be elected by the State Legislative Assembly.
- However, the executive power of the State will be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him with the advice of the Council of Ministers. But the Governor does not have the power to **(a)** appoint the Chief Minister
  - **(b)** issuing a proclamation for introducing 'Governor's Rule' in case of breakdown of constitutional machinery
- The Governor will hold office for a term of five years. The Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister, will be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly.
- The high court of the State will consist of a Chief Justice and two or more other judges. Every Judge of the high court will be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the Governor, and in the case of appointment of a judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the high court.

- The official language of the State will be Urdu, but English will, unless the Legislature by law otherwise provides, continue to be used for all official purposes of the State(s) [145.]
- The State Constitution may be amended by introducing a bill in the Legislative Assembly and getting it passed in each House by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of that House. But the following provisions cannot be amended:
  - o The Relationship of Jammu and Kashmir with the union Government
  - o The extent of executive powers of the State
  - o The extent of legislative powers of the State
  - o The provisions of the Constitution of India as applicable in relation to the State

# Indira-Abdullah Agreement of 1975

Notwithstanding the liberal measures introduced in the State by the adoption of a separate State Constitution the pro-Pakistani elements ('Plebiscite front') in Jammu and Kashmir resorted to protest and agitated a plebiscite to determine whether the State should accede to India or Pakistan. The leader of that front, Sheikh Abdullah got involved in these anti-Indian movements and continued acts against the Indian policy towards the State. After phased negotiations, an agreement was eventually reached on 24 February 1975 and the demand for plebiscite was abandoned by Abdullah and his followers and, on the other hand, it was agreed that the special status of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would continue to remain under the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution of India. However, owing to differences over matters arising out of the agreement, it has not been implemented by issuing a fresh Presidential Order under Article 370.

# THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR VIS-A-VIS THE UNION

#### (a) **Jurisdiction of Parliament**

- The jurisdiction of Parliament in relation to Jammu and Kashmir shall be confined to the matters enumerated in the Union List, and the Concurrent List, subjected to certain modifications, while it shall have no jurisdiction as regards most of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List.
- While in relation to the other States, the residuary power of legislation belongs to Parliament, in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the residuary power shall belong to the legislature of that State, excepting certain matters, specified in 1969, for which Parliament shall have exclusive power, e.g., prevention of activities relating to cession or secession, or disrupting the sovereignty or integrity of India.
- The power to legislate with respect to preventive detention in Jammu and Kashmir, under Article 22(7), shall belong to the legislature of the State instead of Parliament, so that no law of preventive detention made by Parliament will extend to that State.
- By the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1986, however, Article 249 has been extended to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, so that it would now be competent to extend the jurisdiction of Parliament to that, State, in the national interest (e.g., for the protection of the borders of the State from aggression from Pakistan or China), by passing a resolution in the Council of States (Constitution Order, 129).

#### Why do Kashmiris Fear?

People of Kashmir are not satisfied with the autonomy conferred by Article 370 because:

- • Post tribal invasion in 1947 promises were not fulfilled. The promise of 'Plebiscite' not fulfilled.
- The special privileges granted by Article 370 have been continuously eroded.

n n n

#### (b) **Autonomy of the State in certain matters**

The Parliament cannot make any law without the consent of the legislature of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, where that State is to be affected by such legislation, e.g., (i) alteration of the name or territories of the State (Article 3), (ii) international treaty or agreement affecting the disposition of any part of the territory of the State (Article 253).

#### (c) **To safeguard the autonomy of the State of Jammu and Kashmir**

- No decision affecting the disposition of the State can be made by the Government of India, without the consent of the Government of the State.
- The union shall have no power to suspend the Constitution of the State on the ground of failure to comply with the directions given by union under Article 365.
- According to the Amendment Order of 1964, Articles 356–357 relating to constitutional emergency have been extended to Jammu and Kashmir.

#### Dr Charu Wali Khanna versus Union of India

- In this case the constitutional validity of Article 35A is challenged on the grounds that: (a) It was inserted by the Presidential Order into Part III: Fundamental Rights (b) It is conflicting with Article 14: The right to equality
- It also challenges Article 6 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution.

But failure of the constitutional machinery refers to the definition of 'failure' by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and not Part VI of the Constitution of India. In Jammu and Kashmir two types of proclamations are made:

- The 'Governor's Rule' under Section 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir.
- The 'Presidents Rule' under Article 356 as in the case of other States.
- Governor's Rule is provided by the State Constitution. In exercise of this power the Governor has the power, with the concurrence of the President, to assume to himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the State, except those of the high court.
- With respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the union shall have no power to make a proclamation of Financial Emergency under Article 360.

#### (d) **Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles**

- The Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV of Constitution of India) do not apply to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
- Article 35A confers special rights as regards employment, acquisition of property and settlement on 'permanent residents' of the State.
- The fundamental right to property is still guaranteed in this State as the Articles  $1\frac{9(1)}{f}$  and 31(2) still holds good here.

#### (e) **Separate constitution for the State.**

The State of Jammu and Kashmir has its own constitution (made by a separate Constituent Assembly and promulgated in 1957).

#### (f) **Procedure for Amendment of State Constitution.**

While an Act of Parliament is required for the amendment of any of the provisions of the Constitution of India, the provisions of the State Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir (excepting those relating to the relationship of the State with the Union of India) may be amended by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of the State, passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of its membership; but if such amendment seeks to affects the Governor or the Election Commission, it shall have no effects unless the law is reserved for the consideration of the President and receives his assent.

According to Article 370(1), no amendment of the Constitution of India shall extend to Jammu and Kashmir unless it is extended by an Order of the President in that regard.

(g) No alteration of the area or boundaries of this State can be made by Parliament without the consent of the legislature of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.

#### (h) **Other jurisdictions**

The jurisdictions of the Comptroller and Auditor General, of the Election Commission, and the Special Leave Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court have been extended to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, by amendments of the Constitution Order.

# Article 35A Controversy

The present controversy relating to the Article 35A is around the meaning of the term 'permanent residents' and the special rights enjoyed by them in the State. The term 'permanent residents' of the State was first defined, by the order of the Dogra Ruler, in 1927 and reiterated in 1932. According to the order 'all persons born or settled within the state before 1911 or after having lawfully acquired immovable property resident in the state for not less than ten years prior to that date. All emigrants from Jammu and Kashmir, including those who migrated to Pakistan, are considered state subjects. The descendants of emigrants are considered state subjects for two generations.

The Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir framed in 1956 retained the same definition. According to the law enacted by the Jammu and Kashmir legislature later, a non-permanent resident is prohibited from settling in the State, acquiring immovable property and are not eligible for government jobs. Later Article 35A was inserted after Article 35 in Part III (Fundamental Rights) by the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954.

Article 370 provides that any other provisions of the constitution than Articles 1 and 370 shall apply to Jammu and Kashmir with such exceptions specified in the order passed by the President. Accordingly, after Article 35, the new Article 35A was added.

Article 35A provides that any existing law or any law enacted by the Jammu and Kashmir legislature relating to defining the status of permanent resident of the State and conferring certain rights on them shall not be void on the ground of being inconsistent with the fundamental rights. It also empowers the State legislature to impose certain restrictions on the rights of the other persons (those who are not permanent residents of the State according to the law) in respect of:

- Employment under the State Government
- Acquisition of immovable property in the State
- Settlement in the State
- Right to scholarships and such other forms of aid as the State Government may provide.

It is clear that this is a reiteration of the Maharaja's order. The constitutionality of this provision has been challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that:

- It was not inserted by a constitutional amendment under Article 368.
- It was not enacted by the Parliament which is empowered to amend the constitution.
- Article 370 was provided as a 'temporary provision' to bring normality in Jammu and Kashmir and strengthen democracy. It was never intended to bring permanent amendments to the constitution.
- It is discriminatory in nature. It prohibits the Kashmiri woman who marries a non-Kashmiri male loses her succession rights (right to inherit properties). After the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir High Court judgement, the rights of such women were restored. However, the children of such women will not enjoy succession rights. It is a clear infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 14.

# SHOULD THE SPECIAL STATUS FOR JAMMU AND KASHMIR CONTINUE?

As a sequel to the above debate, continuance of Article 370 which grants special status to the State is also questioned. There have been demands for abrogating the provision. The arguments placed for abrogating Article 370 are:

1. It was expected to be a temporary provision and there is no reason for the continuance of the provision

n n n

- 2. The special status was accorded to the State in 1947 due to the political situation after partition and the political turmoil created by the tribal insurgency with the Pakistani support. It was therefore, required for the special status to restore normalcy and strengthen democracy. But at present there is no need for the provision.
- 3. Initially there was a fear that the demographic constitution of the State could be manipulated by encouraging the non-Muslim settlements. However, any such eventuality has not happened and so the provision can be abrogated.
- 4. Also, the State has a government elected by popular vote conducted within the provisions of the constitution.

#### Special Status Challenged

- • Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging constitutional validity of Article 370 and the continuance of special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.
- It is challenged on the ground that it is against "supremacy of the Constitution of India and contrary to dictum of 'One Nation, One Constitution, One National Anthem and One National Flag'.

On the other hand, there are certain important arguments for the continuance of the provisions.

The situation in Jammu and Kashmir has been relatively normal than at the time of independence the State has been infected by cross-border terrorism for a considerable length of time. This requires governing the state with difference in order to gain the confidence of the people and prevent the spread of terrorism to other parts of the State—Jammu and Ladakh.

After 1949, a considerable part of the State has been occupied by Pakistan which aggressed on the State in 1947. Since then the issue remains unsettled and has been referred to the United Nations Organization (UNO). This is clearly an abnormal situation that has to be handled appropriately. The issue coupled with the cross-border terrorism creates the abnormality that requires the special status to the State.

However, the present state of affairs cannot continue for an indefinite period. The 'temporary' provisions need to be removed. The governance of the State has to be improved for that to happen.
