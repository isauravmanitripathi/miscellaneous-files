# INTRODUCTION

PART XIV (Articles 308 to 323) of the Constitution deals with the public services and public service commissions. These provisions are not applicable to Jammu and Kashmir.

The constitution provides for the 'Central Services, State Services, and All India Services' corresponding to the Union List, State List and the Concurrent List in the Schedule VII.

# RECRUITMENT AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE (ARTICLE 309)

The constitution empowers the union Parliament to regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts under the central services.

Until the Parliament enacts the law in this regard the President of India shall have the powers to regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts under the central services.

Similarly, it empowers the State legislature to regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts under the state services.

Until the State legislatures enacts the law in this regard the Governor of the State shall have the powers to regulate the recruitment, and conditions of service of persons appointed, to public services and posts under the state services.

#### Tenure of Office (Article 310)

Every person who is a member of a defence service or civil service of the union or of an All India Services shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.

Every person who is a member of a civil service of a State shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor of the State.

The constitution also provides for the employment of any person having special qualifications in the service of the union or the State governments on a contractual agreement. However, a compensation is to be paid to him if:

- The post is abolished before the expiration of an agreed period or;
- He is required to vacate that post, for reasons not connected with any misconduct on his part.

#### Dismissal, Removal or Reduction in Rank (Article 311)

Any person who is a member of central services or an All India Services or State Services shall not be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.

That is in practice, in case of the members of central services and All India Services, the President is the only authority who can dismiss or remove. And in case of the members of State Services, the Governor is the only authority who can dismiss or remove.

Before any decision on the removal or dismissal is taken, an inquiry has to be conducted. During the inquiry the concerned person must be informed of the charges against him and he must be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of those charges.

It shall not be necessary to give such person any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed to be imposed after such inquiry. This clause was added, replacing the original provision which made it an obligation to give the second opportunity to defend against the punishment proposed, by Constitution (15th Amendment) Act, 1963.

However, due to the extraordinary protection enjoyed by the public servants, government employees and civil servants, several commissions of reform have recommended for the repealing of the Article 311. Even the Second Administrative Reforms Commission has made this recommendation.

#### *Exemption from Inquiry*

In case where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank of the certain grounds, the conduct of inquiry is not needed. The grounds are:

- Conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge.
- Where the authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry. But such reasons have to be recorded by that authority in writing.
- Where the President or the Governor is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to hold such inquiry.

#### ALL INDIA SERVICES

All India Services are the services common to the union and the States. The Constitution of India recognizes three All India Services namely Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and the All India Judicial Service. However, it provides for unlimited number of All India Services.

#### Creation of New All India Services

The constitution empowers the Parliament to create any number of All India Services. Article 312 reads '…Parliament may by law provide for the creation of one or more All India Services (including an All India Judicial Service) common to the union and the States…'

The Parliament can create any All India Service by enacting a law. However, the Parliament can exercise this power only when the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution authorizing the Parliament to create a new All India Service.

The Rajya Sabha has to declare by that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to create a new All India Service by a resolution. Such resolution must be supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting.

The Parliament created Indian Forest Service, the new All India Service in 1962 under this article. Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service shall be deemed to be services created by Parliament under this article.

With regard to the All India Judicial Service which is yet to be created Article 312 provides that it shall not include any post inferior to that of a district judge as defined in Article 236.

#### Need for All India Services

At the time of independence, there was severe opposition to continue have the All India Services. However, the services still continue to exist and are justified on the following grounds:

- (a) All India Services serve as a facilitator between the union and the State governments in matters of common interest.
- (b) All India Services Officers are allocated to different state cadres and they work in different States, thus, they share their experience for the benefit of the nation.
- (c) All India Services officers are recruited by the UPSC and are appointed by the President; hence, they act as impartial advisors to the States as the State government does not have any power to adversely affect them.
- (d) All India Services Officers are recruited through an All India Level Exam of Higher Standards, which in turn sets higher standards to the government.

#### Need for All India Services

All India Services help in:Maintaining better working standards.

- Promoting all India outlook in all the civil servants.
- Strengthening the federation.

The Table 21.1 is a comparison of the constitutional provisions relating to the Public Service Commissions:

### TABLE 21.1 Difference between Nominated and Elected Members *(Continue)*

#### Independence of the Public Service Commissions

The Public Service Commissions in India enjoy constitutionally guaranteed independence.

- (a) The Chairman and the members of the Public Service Commission have a fixed tenure and they do not hold office during the pleasure of any authority (Article 316).
- (b) Their salary, allowances and other expenditure are charged on the Consolidated Fund, in case of UPSC, the Consolidated Fund of India and in case of State Public Service Commissions, the Consolidated Fund of the State (Article 322).
- (c) Their salary, allowance or conditions of office cannot be varied to their disadvantage during their term. It implies that the salary and allowance can be increased but cannot be decreased.
- (d) The Chairman and the members of the Public Service Commissions are barred from holding any office of profit outside their official duty in the Commission (Article 317).
- (e) They are eligible for reappointment to the same office again. That is, a member of UPSC cannot be reappointed as a member of UPSC once his term as a member is completed (Article 316).
- (f) The Chairman and the members are not eligible for any further employment under any government after they cease to hold office as the Chairman or member of the Public Service Commissions (Article 319). It implies that, irrespective of whether the person completed his term as member or Chairman or resigned as member or Chairman of Public Service Commissions or removed, he is ineligible for any employment under the governments.
- (g) The Chairman or the member of the Public Service Commissions can be removed only on the specific ground and the manner provided in the constitution.

#### Changing Role of UPSC

With the changing context of governance by the turn of the millennium, the role played by various constitutional bodies is changing. On the same lines the role of UPSC is also changing.

UPSC cannot be a mere recruiting agency. With the experience it had gained it is expected to play a more strategic role. Recruitment to certain services can be removed from UPSC and can be vested in the bodies like Staff Selection Commission. Similarly, functions like consulting UPSC for granting financial relief can be removed, so that the Commission can be a professional body to formulate Human Resource Development (HRD) policies.

Further, the UPSC must be involved in making other related policy like the education policy so that the Human Resource (HR) experience of the UPSC is used for the good of the nation.

There is a need for uniform personnel policy for the whole nation in the context of globalization. The performance of the State Public Service Commissions is not considered up to the required standards. There have been several allegations against the State Public Service Commissions. UPSC must help in evolving standards to the HR policy for the nation.
