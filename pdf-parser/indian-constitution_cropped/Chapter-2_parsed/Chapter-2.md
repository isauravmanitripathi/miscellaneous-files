# INTRODUCTION TO INDIAN CONSTITUTION

Dr. Ambedkar in the constituent assembly debates observed, 'Given the facts, all constitutions in their main provisions must look similar. The only new things, if any, are to remove the faults and to accommodate it to the needs of the country.' So, the Constitution of India has many features that are unique to it and sets out certain basic principles for the democratic government.

# SALIENT FEATURES OF CONSTITUTION

The salient features of the constitution are as follows:

# 1. Constitution with Many Sources

When making the constitution, the founding fathers had before them two options, one to make a completely new constitution for India and the other to draw from other constitutions that were working at that time. The founding

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

1. What is a constitution? What are the main sources of the Indian Constitution? (GS Mains: 2007)

fathers chose the second method and made Indian constitution by drawing from many sources due to the following reasons:

- They wanted to make use of and learn from the rich experience of certain running constitutions of that time.
- They also wanted to avoid committing the limited resources and time upon making a constitution since the developmental goals were large in volume with more pressing demands.

So, the constituent assembly decided to have the constitution as a 'beautiful patchwork'.<sup>[1]</sup> However, this was not without criticism. Even members of the constituent assembly criticized this as 'a slavish imitation of the West' and would be unworkable. There are critics who comment that 'Indian constitution is a bag of borrowed materials'.<sup>[2]</sup> But this view is not acceptable due to the following reasons.

The founding fathers did not borrow certain features from other constitutions unmindfully. They applied the 'Art of selection and modification' and carefully chose such features that were essential and found useful. Further they suitably modified such features so that they fit into the Indian system. That is, those features were appropriately tailored to fulfil needs and suit the conditions existing in India. It resulted in the emergence of certain new concepts such as 'Democratic Socialism'.

<sup>1</sup> Constituent Assembly Debates

<sup>2</sup> CSE Mains Question 1995: Public Administration

#### Do You Know?

- • A bill to formulate the Constitution of India was drafted in 1895. It was known as *Swaraj* Bill.
- • It is believed that the main inspiration for the bill came from Tilak's concept of *Swaraj*.
- The bill included Myanmar as part of Indian territory.

Further, the founding fathers did not borrow entire set of provisions. They confined to borrowing only the principles and building the details according to the needs of Indian socio-political conditions. For example, the concept of Directive Principles of State Policy has been borrowed from the Irish constitution, but the detailed provisions are unique to India. The concept of 'Living Wage' in Article 43 and 'Organization of Village *Panchayat'* in Article 48 are few to mention. Hence, it would be a gross fallacy to call Indian constitution a bag of borrowed materials. It is a constitution *sui generis*, the kind of which is not found elsewhere.

# 2. The Lengthiest Constitution

The Indian constitution is a very detailed document and the lengthiest constitution in the world. The original constitution had 8 schedules and 395 articles. At present the constitution has 12 schedules and about 462 articles [2016, after the Constitution (Hundredth Amendment) Act].

### *The reasons for the bulkiness*

The diverse nature of the Indian society and the complexities of the problems necessitated the founding fathers to frame the constitution comprehensively. The reasons for its elephantine size are:

- 1. The constitution is the product of an intellectual deliberation that was based on the experiences of all the working constitution of the world and the quest of the framers to avoid all the defects and loopholes of such constitutions.
- 2. The Indian constitution does not only lay down the structure of union government but also that of the state government. Especially after the 73rd and 74th amendment Acts, it deals with the structure of rural and urban local bodies too. After the Constitution (97th Amendment) Act, 2011 provisions relating to cooperatives have been inserted.
- 3. The constitution deals with the detailed distribution of the powers between the union and the state governments.
- 4. The value systems prevailing in the country and the peculiar problems of the Indian society have demanded specific provisions dealing with them. The menace of untouchability resulting from the caste system which is unique to India has necessitated specific provisions dealing with that.
- 5. The units of India are not uniform and they have certain problems unique to them. The constitution had to include for special provisions to meet the peculiar problems of certain regions. To mention one, north eastern states have required special provisions. (Article 371A, 371B and 371C relating to Nagaland, Assam and Manipur respectively). Constitution (98th Amendment) Act, 2012 has inserted Article 371J for the Hyderabad, Karnataka region.
- 6. It has a long list of fundamental rights and Directive Principles of State Policy. After, the 42nd Amendment Act, a list of fundamental duties has been inserted.
- 7. The provisions regarding every individual organ have been provided in order to avoid ambiguity.
- 8. For instance, all high offices are reserved for Indian citizens, therefore, ambiguity needs to be avoided. Hence, the constitution deals with citizenship in seven articles, which otherwise would have been simple.
- 9. The constitution deals with every single aspect of governance and the relationship between the constituent governments and the organs of those governments.
- 10. The adoption of several provisions from the Government of India Act, 1935 has also contributed to the bulkiness of the constitution.

# 3. A Progressively Rigid Constitution

Indian constitution is a blend of flexibility and rigidity. The rigidity/flexibility of a constitution is determined by the procedure for its amendment. The constitution imparts flexibility to federal constitution. Certain provisions of the constitution can be amended by ordinary legislation of the Parliament passed by a simple majority. For example, Article 4 provides that any amendment after creating a new state shall not be deemed to be an amendment and the procedure given in Article 368 need not be followed.

Whereas, other provisions of the constitution can be amended only by following the special procedure enumerated in Article 368. Such amendment has to be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha separately by a special majority prescribed.

With respect to certain other provisions like amending Schedule VII, manner of electing President, Article 368 itself, etc., can be amended only after the amendment is ratified at least half the number of state legislatures. Thus, Indian constitution flows from utmost flexibility to rigidity making it a 'Progressively Rigid Constitution'.

# 4. Residuary Powers Vested in the Union

Unlike the federations of the USA or Australia, the Constitution of India vests the residuary powers in the union. This system has been borrowed from the Canadian constitution. Article 248 vests in the Parliament 'the exclusive power to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the concurrent list or state list'.[4] This power includes the power impose any tax on such matters.

# 5. Constitution Supplemented by Legislations

Constitutional provisions are supplemented by the legislations because:

- (i) It was not practically possible to provide for all exigencies; howsoever the Indian constitution is an exhaustive one.
- (ii) There are several temporary and transitional provisions in the constitution which require the Parliament to enact law.

Hence, the founding fathers have empowered the Parliament and the state legislatures make laws to supplement the constitutional provisions. Many articles of the constitution are enabling provisions and lays down the basic principles.

For instance, Article 17 declares practice of untouchability as an offence punishable under law. Parliament enacted Protection of Civil Rights Act. This adds up to the flexibility of the constitution by enabling suitable modifications to the law whenever needed.

Article 285, provides that the property of the union shall be exempt from all taxes imposed by a state, until Parliament enacts a law in this regard. This is a temporary provision to be operative until the Parliament enacts a law.

#### 4 Article 248

# 6. Judicial Review

Judicial review is an important feature of Indian constitution. Judicial review flows out of Article 13 and Article 32. Judicial review is the power of courts to review the actions of the executive and legislative branches of the government.

Judicial review is an essential feature of a democratic welfare state. Judicial review is concomitant to guaranteed fundamental rights and is essential for protecting them. It legitimizes government actions and enables the functioning of 'Rule of Law'.[5]

According to Ivor Jennings, the Indian constitution provides for a 'limited government' following the American model. However, there are adequate safeguards to ensure that judicial review does not result in 'judicial supremacy'. Further, the fine balance between the sovereignty of the Parliament and the judicial review is indeed a remarkable feature of Indian constitution.

# 7. Guaranteed Fundamental Rights

Under the British rule, the founding fathers of the constitution were not only a witness to how a state could use its legitimate power brutally to suppress its own subjects but were also victims. Hence, it was decided that the independent India's constitution must have fundamental rights guaranteed to people. Hence, they deviated from the English practice of having unenumerated rights and have provided for 'enumerated and guaranteed' fundamental rights in order to:

- (i) Keep them out of the ever-changing pattern of political controversies.
- (ii) Establish them as legal principles, to be applied by the court, as standards. Hence, they have to be kept away from the reach of the majority in the legislature and officials in the government.
- (iii) Protect the individual citizens from the excesses of the state actions.

# 8. Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties

The Constitution of India has a long list of directives prescribed as 'fundamental to governance'. The concept of DPSP has been borrowed from the Irish constitution. The DPSPs are certain values and ideals to be the basis of policy-making. They also contain certain rights that are to be guaranteed to the citizens on a later date. It is a sort of a reminder.

The Constitution 42 Amendment Act, 1976 added the fundamental duties. They are borrowed from the constitution of erstwhile USSR and are not enforceable. They are included based on the concept that the rights in civilized society must always go with duties.

# 9. Universal Adult Franchise

Article 326 of the constitution provides for the 'right to vote' to all citizens who have completed 18 years of age. Irrespective of the educational, economic, social and other backgrounds the citizen of India will have the right to vote. It is one of the most important features of 'popular sovereignty'. India being a diverse society, it becomes all the more important to grant this right to promote equality among the citizens.

# 10. Conventions Under the Constitution

Constitutional conventions are political practices that crystallize into a set of rules over a period of time. According to Professor Dicey, the discretionary powers of the Crown in England are determined by the conventions. Such conventions also act as the rules governing the exercise of such powers. Conventions grow where the law is silent and such a convention will not breach the law but fill the gap.

Though Indian constitution is an exhaustive, it has left certain aspects for conventions and hence, has a wide scope for the growth of convention. Since the constitution coming into force, several conventions have been established. For instance, Article 75 empowers the President to appoint the Prime Minister, but the constitution is silent about how the President will select the Prime Minister. This has given room for the growth of convention. By applying the concept of collective responsibility, the President appoints the leader of the party which has won the highest number of seats in the House of the People. However, when no political party gains the required majority the President had to follow the conventional practice as the constitution does not provide a way out. In such circumstances the following conventions are established:

- (i) If there is no single party with an absolute majority, the President may appoint the leader of a prepoll alliance that has a majority.
- (ii) If there is no such pre-poll alliance that has a majority, the President may invite the leader of the pre-poll alliance who is supported by a sufficient number of Lok Sabha MPs to command an absolute majority.
- (iii) It is only when options A and B are ruled out that the President may invite the leader of a postpoll alliance. The President will make sure that the groups or parties agree to some common programme or policies. The post-poll alliance must elect its leader before the President invites it to form the government.

## 11. Parliamentary Democracy

'Parliamentary democracy, democratic form of government in which the party (or a coalition of parties) with the greatest representation in the Parliament (legislature) forms the government, its leader becoming Prime Minister. Executive functions are exercised by members of the Parliament appointed by the Prime Minister to the cabinet. The parties in the minority serve in opposition to the majority and have the duty to challenge it regularly'.[6] It is also known as Cabinet Form of Government with ministerial responsibility. The Constitution of India sets up parliamentary form of government to both the union and the states. Indian system is a legacy of the British rule and follows the English Parliamentary System.

#### *Characteristic Features of Parliamentary Democracy*

Parliamentary democracy has certain important features which are:

#### 1. **Dual Executive**

In the parliamentary democracy, there are two executives namely, the titular head and the real executive head. The former is the head of the state and the latter is the head of the government. In India, the President is the titular head and the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers is the real executive head. Constitution regulates the relationship between the two.

#### 2. **Bicameral Legislature**

In the parliamentary democracy, there are two Houses namely, the Council of States and the House of the People.

#### 3. **Responsible Government**

A responsible government is one which is responsible to the people. It is essential that the government enjoys the confidence of the Parliament for making laws to govern the country.

Responsible government refers to two elements of parliamentary government in British derived parliamentary systems. First, the government— Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, is accountable to the Lower House of Parliament. Hence, the government must maintain majority support in the Lower House; loss of that support means that the government must resign. In this sense,

<sup>6</sup> Britannica Encyclopedia: https://www.britannica.com/topic/parliamentary-democracy.

responsible government is another term for parliamentary government; a ministry is 'responsible' to Parliament for the activities of government and must resign if it loses the confidence of the lower house. Thus, a government whose accountability to people is ensured through the answerability to the Houses of the Parliament for all its acts, is a 'Responsible Government'.

Responsible Government

---

- The system originated in Canada.
- Survives on the support of an elected legislature.
- • Upholds 'public accountability'.

This meaning of responsible government, is based on the principle that the ministers must be drawn from the majority party and they remain in office so long as they enjoy the support of the majority of members in the House of the People. From this flow chart the doctrines of ministerial responsibility and collective responsibility.

4. **Ministerial Responsibility**

![](_page_6_Figure_8.jpeg)

The parliamentary form of government is otherwise known as 'Cabinet Form of Government with Ministerial Responsibility'. The collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the House of People for all acts of commission and omission of the government and the individual minister being answerable to the Houses of Parliament for the performance of the ministry/department in his charge are two dimensions of ministerial responsibility.

**Collective Responsibility:** Collective responsibility implies that the whole Council of Ministers is a single unit. The object of collective responsibility is to make the whole body of persons holding the ministerial office collectively.[7] Every individual minister is held responsible and accountable for the decisions made by the council. According to Supreme Court, even if the individual minister may not be responsible for the decision, he will be deemed to share the responsibility with the council. 'In practice, this means that a decision of cabinet or one of its committees is binding on all members of the government, regardless of whether they were present when the decision was taken or their personal views.'<sup>(8)</sup> 'The principle requires that ministers must express their views frankly and argue freely in private while maintaining unity when decisions have been reached. The privacy of opinions expressed in cabinet and ministerial committees should be maintained.'<sup>(9)</sup> Therefore, the Council of Ministers 'swim or sink' together.

<sup>8</sup> Cabinet Manual: Government of UK, Chapter 4 – 'Collective cabinet decision-making' Page 31

<sup>9</sup> Cabinet Manual: Government of UK, Chapter 4 - 'Collective cabinet decision-making' Page 31

**Individual Minister's Responsibility:** According to Article 77(3), the President allocates the portfolios to the ministers and each minister is in-charge of a ministry or department. He is the political head and the secretary to the department is the permanent head. The minister is held accountable before the Parliament for all 'acts of commission and omission', of the secretary. Although the constitution has not expressly provided for the individual responsibility of the ministers to the Parliament, it is practised in India similar to English Parliamentary System. The minster is responsible for answering any question raised on the Floor of the House, defend any bill or policy of the department and reply to queries raised, part of any debate or discussion on motions. Thus, the officials are protected from being questioned in public. This is known as the 'Principle of Anonymity of the Civil Service'.

 The 'Principle of Anonymity' is practised to enable the civil servant to be 'apolitical', 'neutral', 'disinterested' and 'professional' advisor to the Council of Ministers. 'Apolitical' refers to the administrators not being aligned to any political party, especially not leaning to political views while discharging their official duties. The civil servant is expected not be biased and neutralize his value preferences while involved in the official decision-making. Further he must not have any personal interest in any of the official dealings. Thus, he is expected to be 'professional' in advising the Council of Ministers.<sup>[10]</sup>

#### 5. **Weak Separation of Powers**

Montesquieu, a French social and political philosopher coined the term 'separation of powers' in his book 'Spirit of the Laws'. According to him, the political authority of the state is divided into legislative, executive and judicial powers in order to promote liberty most effectively.

Separation of powers is an essential element of the Rule of Law and limits one branch from exercising the core functions of another and prevents the concentration of power and provides for checks and balances. The legislature enacts the laws, the executive implements and administers the law and public policy and the judiciary interprets the constitution and laws and decide disputes.

In the presidential form of government there is a complete separation of powers. However, this arrangement is weak in the parliamentary system. 'The parliamentary government has a sort of link between the executive, the legislative and the judiciary.<sup> $(11)$ </sup> In the parliamentary system there is a strong executive branch government but answerable to and controlled by the legislature.

#### 6. **Continuous coordination of Legislature and Executive**

'The presidential government has complete separation of powers of the three principal organs of the state, each embodying the sovereignty of the people in the different aspects of the state's activities and there is no link between them.'<sup>(12)</sup> Hence, in this form the executive is pivoted on the President and he is the chief executive and the source of all executive power. In such a system the imminent danger of personality cult is unavoidable. As a consequence, there is a need for continuous coordination of the executive and legislature. This is a natural feature in the parliamentary form of government as there is no complete separation of powers.

Furthermore, given the low rate of literacy and low level of political socialization in India it would be difficult to resolve any conflict between the three organs of the government. The coordination system inherent to the parliamentary form helps resolving such conflicts by itself without the citizen playing a role. To quote Shri K. Hanumanthaiya, 'Instead of having a conflicting trinity it is better to have a harmonious governmental structure'.<sup>[13]</sup>

#### 7. **Complete and Continuous Responsibility of Executive to Legislature**

The founding fathers wanted to establish a responsible and accountable government; they wanted the government to be sensitive to public expectations, hence, they had chosen the parliamentary form of government.

<sup>13</sup> Constituent Assembly Debates

The 'complete and continuous responsibility' of the executive to the Parliament is the most distinctive characteristic feature of a parliamentary democracy. Hence, the parliamentary system of government is also known as cabinet form of government with ministerial responsibility. According to M. V. Pylee, the parliamentary system works under the 'principle of concentrated authority under strict control'. This on the one hand enables an 'intimate cooperation' between the Council of Ministers and the Parliament and on the other fixes' responsibility of the council to the Parliament. Hence, the council is under the constant vigil of the Parliament which is the 'real merit' of the Parliament system.

#### *Merits of and Reason behind India adopting Parliamentary Form*

- (a) **Responsible government:** Government subjected to legislature scrutiny establishing its accountability to the people.
- (b) The Head of Government (Prime Minister) enjoying the support of majority of total membership of the House of People (Lok Sabha).
- (c) **Continuous coordination** between the executive and the legislature in matters of policy-making and implementation.
- (d) **'Society in the Miniature':** In a polycultural society like India enables all sections, even the minuscule minority of the society being represented the Parliament.
- (e) **Economic and financially less burdensome:** A single election to Parliament only and the rest of the offices are elected indirectly.
- (f) **Flexibility:** An incompetent government can be removed before the expiry of the term without changing the composition of the Parliament and new government formed.
- (g) **Simple:** System is very simple to understand and administer in a country like India with high rate of illiteracy.
- (h) The bicameral Parliament makes the law and controls the executive.
- (i) **Experience factor:** India was used to the parliamentary system since the British period.

#### *Demerits of the Parliamentary Form*[14]

In spite of the above merits and the valid reasons for India adopting the system, the parliamentary form also suffers from certain weakness and has demerits. There have been several 'aberrations' in the way the system has worked in the past decades.

#### 1. **Sprouting Political Parties**

The presence of multiple political parties is a remarkable feature of a vibrant democracy. However, when the number of parties increases beyond a particular limit it becomes detrimental to the functioning of the system itself. In India the presence of too many parties has caused instability. The elections have resulted in 'hung assemblies' and forming the governments has become a problem. Many a times the incumbent governments have fallen due to this.

Before 1978, this phenomenon was found in states only, but after that it is also found in the Central government. Since 1989 till 2014, India had the 'coalition era' in which no political party could secure the majority in the Lok Sabha.

#### 2. **Defection**

Defection is an evil which threatens the very basis of a democracy causing instability. The powerhungry politicians have toppled the governments by shifting their political affiliations for 'reasons' other than principles and merely political. To check this constitution (52nd Amendment) Act, 1985 was enacted. Schedule X to the constitution was added.

#### 3. **National Parties without Cohesiveness and Strong Leadership**

The national parties in India lacked unity and cohesion among them. Further they did not have effective mechanisms to resolve the differences within the party. This had devoid them the ability to provide leadership to the nation. This also weakened the position of the Prime Minister and it demanded him to spend more time on resolving the differences than for more vital issues concerning the policy and administration. There have also been a lot of dissensions among the members of the party. This becomes a concern more in the coalition government in which the Prime Minister has to accommodate his alliance partners in his council.

As a consequence, the national parties failed to focus on certain issues concerning the states/ regions that caused feeling of being deprived in the states. This gave a fertile ground for the rise of many regional parties.

#### 4. **Rise of Regional Parties**

Since late 1950's and early 1960's the rise of regional political parties is witnessed. The major reasons for their rise and growth are the indifferent attitude of the national parties and demand for state autonomy. Although the demand for state autonomy is a natural phenomenon and an acceptable in a federal constitution, the approach the parties have taken was appropriate.

In the era of coalition in the post 1989 phase the regional parties had held the Central government to political ransom. National parties lost their standing in many states and no party could muster majority required for forming the government. As a result, they had to depend on the regional parties. Several times the regional parties had shifted their stand toppling the government and causing instability and frequent elections.

#### 5. **Fragmentation of House**

Due to the multiplicity of political parties and the increased strength of the regional parties and other smaller parties in the Houses of Parliament the House are fragmented. The parties based on religion and castes have contributed to the fragmentation of the House.

The debates and discussions have been more on such considerations as party ideology, interest of the religious and caste groups instead of the merit of the issue being discussed. Further, the whip system and the anti-defection law have done away with members voting on issues cutting party lines.

The founding fathers of the constitution did not envisage this and their vision was to develop a political culture in which the interest of the people is put primary to any political interest. Hence, this is an aberration of the parliamentary form of government.

#### 6. **Low Rate of Literacy and Political Socialization among the Voters**

The literacy rate in India is generally low which has also contributed to the low level of political socialization among the voters. Therefore, peoples' knowledge about political process, their rights and entitlements and political maturity are very low. As a result, the voting behaviour is based on the issues concerning the nation. The electorate do not consider the national issues and vote instead they vote on the basis of caste, religion and other factors.

In the recent past money has become a powerful determinant of voting behaviour as political parties indulge in bribing the voters. In 2016, in Tamil Nadu the election commission had been forced to countermand the election to two constituencies on the ground that there was a largescale distribution of money by all the political parties. There have been incidences of seizure and it is reported that 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections saw the highest amount of money seized ever.
### 7. **Criminalization of Politics[15]**

The link that politics and crime have is inseparable and has attained a dangerous proposition. N. N. Vohra Committee report found out the sinister link between the politicians, bureaucrats and the criminals. The National Police Commission, 1977 observed: "The manner in which different political parties have functioned, particularly on the eve of periodic election, involves the free use of musclemen and 'Dadas' to influence the attitude and conduct of sizable sections of the electorate."

Most of the small political parties today are based on caste, religion etc., and do not have a political philosophy. They do not conduct a principle-based politics and do not have a vision for the development of people. They indulge in vote bank politics influencing voters using money and muscle power. The criminals are very helpful to the politicians in this front and the criminalization of politics is a natural outcome.

This is aggravated by the weakness of the Election Commission. The powers of the Election Commission remain largely undefined. Also, the commission depends on the state government officials for its administrative needs. The state officials, especially the police, often show an indifferent attitude and do not cooperate with the commission. Though the commission in the recent past has launched the voter education programme to educate the voters of their rights, the dissemination of knowledge relating to the rules, rights and duties of the voters is still at large.

# *Aberrations of Parliamentary Form of Government in India*[16]

The term aberration means 'a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically an unwelcome one'. The demerits mentioned above are also the aberrations of the parliamentary form of government. They are considered as aberrations because they represent a deviation from the expected system.

The presence of multiple political parties keeps the democracy vibrant and is an important feature of parliamentary democracy. The presence of multiple parties which represent the interest of the people is welcome. But political parties formed on the basis of caste and communal lines do not represent the people's interest but inculcate parochial interests. In the recent times we also witness political parties formed without any political principles and solely based on the popularity of the leader. Hence, it is an aberration.

The rise of regional political parties is another important feature of parliamentary democracy. It is essential that the regional interests are heard and adequately represented in the policies, in a polycultural and diversified society like that of India. This becomes all the more needed when the national parties fail to do the same. However, the regional parties must genuinely represent the regional interests and must not breed regional parochialism. There have been political parties that have fuelled the local parochial tendencies resulting in unrest and at times riots. Hence, it is considered an aberration.

When any issue is discussed in the House of the Parliament every member expressing a different view is an expected behaviour. Any member will view the issue from his standpoint which could be aligned with the party to which he belongs. Moreover, he may present his view keeping the interest of the constituency in accordance with the manifesto on which people was elected by the people. It is a natural and welcome feature of democracy. But in the recent times it is found that the members either support or oppose any issue not on the basis of the merit of the issue, but more on political lines. Neither the general public interest nor the national outlook nor the interest of the constituency forms the basis of the debate. Hence, it is an aberration.

'Whip' is a traditional practice in any democracy. The party through the chief whip issues periodic notices and directives informing them of the important debates and the manner in which they participate and vote in the debate. It is mainly to discipline the members of the party in the Houses of the

n n n

<sup>15</sup> IAS MAINS (2007)-What is criminalization of politics?

<sup>16</sup> CSE Mains 2001 Question, Bring out the aberrations of the Parliamentary Democracy in India.

Parliament. According to the Schedule  $X^{(17)}$ , any member who votes or abstains from voting against the party whip, it is defection and he will be disqualified. He cannot vote exercising his individual judgement, articulate his opinion and vote. He has to tow the party stand. Thus, the system results in a 'forced consensus' and reduces the democracy to a mere number game. Hence, it is an aberration.

'Defection' is definitely an evil practice. It had been the main reason for the political instability in the past. There had been occasions when the members of Parliament defected from one party to another in day. Political parties had accommodated them in the cabinet when the members shifted their loyalties. This had made the democracy a mockery. This practice was witnessed in 1977 and in many states. This was the main reason for the introducing the Schedule X. But the definition of defection as given in the Schedule X has effectively stopped the free exchange of views among the Members of Parliament. The MPs today remain fragmented and keep themselves away from each other. It has completely done away with 'cross voting' (voting in the legislature cutting across the party lines if the issue is meritorious and any member wants to support even if the party to which belongs took an opposite view) which makes democracy more vibrant. Hence, it is an aberration.

# 12. Federal Constitution

Usually any constitution that satisfies the following five conditions is considered as federal constitutions. The conditions are as follows:

- Division of powers and dual government
- Written constitution
- Rigid constitution
- Independent judiciary
- Supremacy of constitution

**Division of Powers and Dual Government:** It is 'the principle that sovereignty should be divided between the federal government and the states'.<sup>[18]</sup> 'The basic principle of federation is that the legislative and executive authority is partitioned between the centre and the states, not by any law to be made by the centre but by the constitution itself....<sup>'(19)</sup> Thus, the division of powers is vertical distribution of powers between the centre and the states. It results in the duality of governments—centre and states. It is the most fundamental principle of a federation.

According to M. V. Pylee, 'In the modern age, there is a need for reconciliation between two divergent tendencies, the widening range of common interests and the need for local autonomy'. Certain matters have a national impact and have to be dealt with a national outlook. On the other hand, there are certain other matters that need to deal with at the local level. For instance, when a policy is made it required to take a national outlook in order to cater to the common interest of all states. But when such policy is implemented the local needs, values and problems need to be considered. This is enabled by the concept of division of powers. The Schedule VII of Indian constitution contains three lists of subjects namely, union list upon which the union government has the exclusive power to legislate and state list upon which the state government has the exclusive power to legislate.<sup>[20]</sup>

**Written Constitution:** A written constitution is a single document that formally defines the nature of the political system and the rights guaranteed to the citizens. It codifies the rules that govern the political system. It is need to ensure that the distribution of powers between the centre and the states must be

Article 246 (3) Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Schedule VII (in this Constitution referred to as the 'State List').

Union Government with Exclusive Powers State Government with Exclusive Powers

clear and without any ambiguity. Further, it lays down the procedure for amendment to the constitution if it is needed.

**Rigid Constitution:** Whether a constitution is rigid or flexible is determined by the process by which it is amended. If the amendment process is difficult such constitutions are known as rigid constitution. A rigid constitution is not one which not subjected to any amendment. Any constitution that does not adapt to the changing circumstances is bound to fail. Usually federal constitutions lay down complex procedure. Neither the centre nor the state governments can amend the constitution affecting the distribution of powers, without the consent of the other.

Indian constitution is a progressively rigid constitution. It lays down a procedure in article 368. Any provision of the constitution can be amended passing a constitution amendment bill by a special majority. In case of any amendment to the certain provisions the ratification by atleast half the number of state legislatures is required. Thus, the Indian constitution is a rigid constitution.

**Independent Judiciary:** A written constitution has a higher potential to be ambiguous and its meaning might not be understood as same by all at all times. Disputes arising between the centre and the states upon the terms of the division of powers and the respective areas of their authority are unavoidable. Such disputes have to be settled in accordance with the constitution by an independent and impartial arbiter. An independent judiciary is, therefore, is an essential part of a federal system. The Indian constitution provides for judiciary whose independence is ensured by several provisions.

**Supremacy of Constitution:** Constitution is the supreme law to which the union and states are subordinated. They are obliged to obey and honour the constitution. Neither the union nor the states can override the constitution. In certain cases, the union has overriding powers, but that does not permit encroachment of the state's jurisdiction.

**India—A Federation or Not?:** 'The Indian constitution is basically federal in form and is marked by the traditional characteristics of a federal system, namely, supremacy of the constitution, division of power between the union and state governments, existence of an independent judiciary and a rigid procedure for the amendment of the constitution. It establishes a duly polity, with clearly defined spheres of authority between the union and the states, to be exercised in fields assigned to them respectively. $(21)$ 

'There is an independent judiciary to determine issues between the union and the states, to be exercised in fields assigned to them respectively. There is an independent judiciary to determine issues between the union and the states, or between one state and another.' Hence, Indian constitution is a federal constitution. However, the Indian constitution also has several non-federal features. Professor K. C. Wheare called the Constitution of India as, 'Quasi-federal' and that Indian union is 'a unitary state with subsidiary federal features rather than a federal state with subsidiary unitary features'.

### **Non-federal Features in the Constitution**

- 1. The word 'federal' is not found anywhere in the Constitution of India. On the contrary, Article 1 provides that 'India shall be a union of states'.
- 2. **Single Citizenship:** The constitution provides only for a single citizenship. Only the union has the right to make laws on citizenship. The states do not have such powers.
- 3. **Single Constitution:** Unlike the USA where states have their own constitution, in India there is only one constitution for both centre and states.
- 4. **Residuary Powers:** The residuary powers being vested in the union (Article 248).
- 5. **No Right to Territorial Inviolability:** The boundaries of the states in India can be altered by an ordinary law of the Parliament. According to Article 3, 'Parliament may by-law form a new state by separation of territory, from any state or by uniting two or more states or parts of states or by uniting any territory to a part of any state.'
- 6. **Single Unified Judiciary:** There are no separate federal court and high court. The Supreme Court is the federal court and the apex court in India. All the high courts are subordinate to the Supreme

<sup>21</sup> Supreme Court of India: Ganga Ram Moolchandani vs State of Rajasthan case: AIR 2001 SC 2616, July 2001.

Court. The judges of high courts are appointed by the President and are removed by the President only on the resolution of the Parliament.

- 7. **Centralized Emergency Powers:** The emergency powers are vested in the centre only and the states do not have any powers regarding emergency. Even the constitutional emergency is proclaimed by the President on the advice of the union council of ministers.
- 8. **Centralized Amendment Powers:** The power to amend the constitution is vested in the Parliament. The states do not have any power to initiate or influence the constitutional amendment.
- 9. **Unequal Representation of States in the Rajya Sabha:** The states are not equally represented in the Rajya Sabha. The seats in Rajya Sabha are distributed in proportion to the population of the states. This curtails the autonomy of the smaller states.
- 10. **Office of the Governor:** The Governor to the states is appointed by the President. He holds office during the pleasure of the President. Governor plays a dual role as the constitutional head of the state and also as the representative of the union government in the states. According to Article 356, the report of the Governor is a base on which the constitutional emergency is proclaimed.
- 11. **All India Services:** All India service officers are appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Union Public Service Commission. They enjoy immunity from the state governments. The state government does not have any authority to take disciplinary actions on the All India Service Officers (Articles 310 and 311).
- 12. **Centralized Election Machinery:** The Central Election Commission conducts the election to legislative assemblies and legislative councils of state.
- 13. **Centralized Auditing of State Accounts:** The Comptroller and Auditor General of India is responsible for the maintenance of the accounts of the state governments and also audits them.
- 14. **Control of Union over States:** The union government has the powers to control the state governments. The union government has the powers to issue binding directions to the states. In case any state did not comply with such directions then, 'it shall be lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.<sup> $(22)$ </sup> In such case the President can proclaim constitutional emergency on the state.
- 15. **Power of the Parliament to enact on State Subjects:** There are certain provisions of the constitution under which the Parliament can enact law on the matters enumerated in the state list. Such provisions are:
  - (a) **Article 249:** In case the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution that 'it is necessary or expedient in the national interest', then the Parliament can legislate on any matter in the state list.
  - (b) **Article 250:** While a Proclamation of National Emergency is in operation, the union government will have unlimited powers to legislate on any matter given in the state list.
  - (c) **Article 251:** In case of any law made the state legislature was inconsistent with the laws made by the Parliament under Article 249 or Article 250 then the law made by Parliament shall prevail over the laws made by the state legislature.
  - (d) **Article 252:** If two or more states pass a resolution requesting the Parliament to enact a law common to them on any matter in state list then the Parliament can enact such a law.
  - (e) **Article 253:** The Parliament can enact any law on any matter including the state subjects in order to give effect to any international agreement or treaty.

The above-mentioned are only a few of the non-federal features. As result of this at times the Indian constitution is known as a 'Quasi-federal Constitution'. However, the inclusion of the non-federal features is not accidental and those features have been added after considerable deliberation in the constituent assembly.

"The union of India is a federal union, with a distribution of powers, of which the judiciary is the interpreter. Although there has been considerable controversy whether India is or is not a federation and although some writers have called it 'quasi-federal', it would seem that essentially the Indian constitution is a federal one."<sup>(23)</sup>

**Reasons for Incorporating Non-federal Features<sup>[24]</sup>:** The non-federal features have been deliberately incorporated due to certain reasons which are as follows:

- 1. The bitter experience of partition demanded the founding fathers of the constitution to incorporate certain features to maintain the territorial integrity of the country.
- 2. The presence of divisive forces even after the partition also made required to incorporate certain features to maintain the territorial integrity of the country.
- 3. India being a polycultural society, the tendency towards division was prone to be high. Hence, it was necessary to have a strong centre for preserving the territorial integrity of the country.
- 4. The polyculturalism has the potential to provide a fertile ground for the rise and growth of regionalism which could eventually escalate as divisive force. The centre needs to be strong enough to handle any such crisis that could be endangering the territorial integrity of the nation.
- 5. The centre has to be strong enough to take proper actions against any state which at times function against the basic spirit of the constitution. For this the constitution has vested the power to control the states in the union.
- 6. As a welfare state, the welfare policies need to be uniform for the whole nation in their letter and spirit. The presence of institutions like All India Service enables this. Further, it is also necessary to have All India Services with the national outlook in order to promote the welfare policies of the polycultural society with the conflicting interests.

Going by the above reasons, it can be concluded that the presence of such features are not accidental but are deliberately done. Moreover, the non-federal features have an emergency character and coming to play only when such emergency circumstances arise. Hence, one shall not be apprehensive about this.

To conclude whether the constitution is federal or otherwise on the basis of theoretical precepts is not completely correct. It is because both unitary and federal are functional concepts rather than theoretical conditions. Therefore, to conclude on the nature of a constitution one has to observe its operation.

Further the conditions of federation are derived as an inference from the American constitution. It is not essential for every constitution to satisfy such conditions because every constitution reflects and has social values relevant to its society as its basis. On this line the Indian constitution has a number of unitary features not as a deviation from federal path but as a basic requirement.

Further, the mode of formation of Indian federation is different from that of the USA; while the federation is evolved in the USA, India inherited the federation from the Government of India Act 1935, before entering into the federation the states of America were sovereign states whereas in India it is not so.

Hence, the Indian constitution cannot be called as quasi-federal rather it is better to call it as federation *sui generis*.

Cooperative Federalism<sup>[25]</sup>: According to Granville Austin, the founding fathers expected Indian constitution to function on the basis of cooperative federalism. The concept of cooperative federalism means that the Indian constitution can assume the federal nature only on the basis of cooperation between the union and the states. It is to be based on the commitment to the constitution goals of the union and the state government. 'Cooperative federalism is intended to ensure a minimum bundle of basic services and a nationally acceptable level of living for all the people of the country.<sup> $(26)$ </sup>

The essence of cooperative federalism is that the centre and the state governments should be guided by the broader national concerns of using the available resources for the benefit of the people. Cooperative federalism encourages the government at different levels to take advantage of a large

<sup>23</sup> Supreme Court - Keshav Singh vs Speaker, legislative assembly, 10 March, 1965- AIR 1965 SC745, 762.

<sup>24</sup> Though the federal principle is dominant in our constitution and that principle is one of its basic features, but it is equally true that federalism under the Indian constitution leans in favour of a strong centre, a feature that militates against the concept of strong federalism. – IAS Mains (GS) – 2014.

national market, diverse and rich natural resources and the potential of human capabilities in all parts of the country and from all sections of the society for building a prosperous nation.<sup>[27]</sup>

Cooperative federalism makes it possible to raise all the available resources by the government at different levels in a coordinated way and channel them for use for the common good of the people. This requires a harmonious relationship and cooperative spirit between the centre and the states and among the states themselves. While a healthy competition among the states for evolving efficient and socially desirable policies and programmes is welcome, any competition which nullifies each other's advantages in development and erodes the resource base of the states should be avoided.<sup>[28]</sup>

The state government is expected to understand the difficulties faced by the union government in achieving the constitution goals. On the other hand, the union government is expected not to interfere into the states' autonomy and extend to them all possible assistance. The use of unitary powers shall be resorted to only at times of crisis. But due to the lack of vision and commitment, Indian federation turned out to be a bargaining federation. The political causes and exigencies made the union and the state government to bargain for cooperation, ultimately resulting in 'bargaining federalism'.

**Drawbacks of the Existing System:** The following reasons can be quoted for the expected 'cooperative federalism' turning out to be a 'bargaining federalism'.

## 1. **Attempt to Thwart the Doctrine of Supremacy of the Constitution**

 Doctrine of supremacy of the constitution is an essential feature of federalism. However, several attempts have been made to encroach on the constitution and thwart the constitutional supremacy. The quotable example is the Constitution 25th Amendment Act, which sought to usher into parliamentary supremacy. This resulted in the Supreme Court propounding the doctrine of basic structure in the Kesavananda Bharati case.

#### 2. **Absence of a Non-political Advisory Body**

**. . .** 

 It is a healthy process to review the intergovernmental relations by a neutral and non-political body. According to Rajamannar Committee on Centre-State Relations, the Inter State Council (ISC) is best fit to be such neutral and non-political body. The ISC is an advisory body and its recommendations are not binding on the government. But the committee recommended that the recommendations of the ISC must be 'ordinarily binding' on both the centre and the states.

 All decisions of national importance and decisions that affect the interest of the states must be taken only after consulting the ISC. Similarly, any bill that will affect the interest of the states must be referred to the ISC before being introduced in the Parliament. But the ISC is not involved in policy-making nor has decision-making authority. In fact, the ISC meetings have been conducted sporadically and have been a victim of politics.

 Even the National Commission to review the working of the constitution recommended for a permanent institution for enabling a healthy consultation between the centre and the states. The commission also opined that the ISC can play this role effectively.

# 3. **Abuse of the Constitutional Provisions**

 In several occasions, various constitutional provisions were subjected to abuse in such a manner that it adversely affected the federal structure. For instance, Article 356 which provides for constitutional emergency has been abused. Only after Bommai's case judgment the practice was discontinued. Even then the judgement is not complied with fully. The recent cases in Arunchal Pradesh and Uttarkhand are examples.

<sup>25</sup> The concept of cooperative federalism has been increasingly emphasized in recent years. Highlight the drawbacks in the existing structure and the extent to which cooperative federalism would answer the shortcomings. –IAS Mains (GS) 2015.

<sup>28</sup> Planning Commission of India: 9th Five Year Plan (Volume-1), Chapter 6—Cooperative Federalism and Decentralization, Introduction.

## 4. **Extra constitutional Factors influencing Federal Polity[29]**

 Apart from the factors discussed above, there are certain extra constitutional factors that influence the federal polity in India. Extra constitutional factors those which are not provided in the constitution but are established by the order of the executive. Such factors are:

- 1. NITI *Ayog*
- 2. Centrally Sponsored Schemes
- 3. National Integration Council
- 4. Prime Minister's Office
- 5. Governor's Conference
- 6. District Collectors Conference convened by Union Government

## 5. **Absence of Regular Opposition Conclaves**

One of the symbols of a healthy and responsible federalism is the opposition conclaves, the meetings of the parties that are not in power and the opposition party. Such a practice is a regular feature in the English system where the opposition organizes a shadow cabinet. Such an arrangement helps in developing a perspective from the other side and strengthens the democracy. Therefore, such conclaves must be organized regularly. A matured and responsible role of opposition is essential for such conclaves to be organized regularly and institutionalized. The present political system in India today lacks such responsible opposition.

## 6. **Confrontationist attitude of the Regional Parties**

 The responsible role of opposition is hampered by the confrontationist attitude of the opposition parties especially the regional parties. The regional parties still tend to hold the stand of forming a 'Federation without Centre'. This view was openly expressed in 1996 when the opposition Chief Ministers met in Hyderabad. The United Front government was formed with this slogan which grossly weakened the Central government against the constitutional scheme.

### 7. **Role of Governor**

 The office of Governor has always been in the centre of controversy with respect to federalism. The union governments had used the office to establish their dominance on the states. The states have been constantly resented to this practice. The recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission are noteworthy in this regard. The practice of President withdrawing his 'pleasure' on the Governor of certain states, with the change of regime in the centre after the general election to Lok Sabha.

 In 2004 when the UPA government took charge the Governors appointed by the NDA government were removed on the ground of their ideological base. They were called as 'tainted Governors' and their removal was justified. Similarly, in 2014 when the NDA formed the union government the Governors appointed by the UPA government were forced to resign.

 In the present times, with respect to the state of Tamil Nadu a separate Governor was not appointed for a period of one year after the term of the previous Governor expired. Though the constitution (Article 153) permits the appointment of the Governor of a state to be appointed as the Governor of another state, it has to be a contingency arrangement. It must not be practised as a regular feature. It will adversely affect the federal character of the constitution adversely.

The foregoing points clearly explain the drawbacks of the existing system in achieving the 'cooperative federalism'. At this juncture it is also worthwhile to understand other challenges to federalism in the present times.

**Challenges to Federalism:** In the present times the problems and challenges transcend borders and demand an integrated approach for resolving them. This has become the order in the globalized world. Such issues are:

• The environmental issues relating to pollution, climate change and sustainable development transcend borders.

**ARA** 

<sup>29</sup> Discuss the major extra constitutional factors influencing the federal polity in India.

• Disasters, both man-made and natural do not confine to borders and require united and cooperative approach. The Uttarkhand floods in (the river Alaknanda floods) in 2013 and the Chennai floods in 2015 are examples.

**...** 

- The interpretations of the constitutional goals by the Supreme Court also demand absolute cooperation between the centre and the states for achieving them. For instance, the Doctrine of Public Trust evolved by the Court (M. C. Mehta versus Kamal Nath case) makes it clear that the state does not enjoy ownership right over the resources but only a trustee to manage for the welfare of the people. The court struck down the sale of the telecom spectrum on this basis.
- In the globalization era the states also have stakes with respect to development and investments. Any international agreement or project relating to this demands true cooperation of the centre and the states based on mutual trust and confidence.
- Similarly, the external powers tend to take advantage of the globalization phenomenon to interfere into the internal affairs, especially security issues. In 2006 the US ambassador to India bypassed the hierarchy and offered the USA assistance to the Assam government to investigate the terror attack. This requires the union and the states to maintain absolute cooperation to protect the national unity and integrity.
- Another development in the recent times is that the states, especially the border states, have asserted themselves by demanding a role in the foreign policy. It is now essential for the union government to consider the interests of and the challenges faced by the states in this regard. The issue of 'International River Water Sharing', terrorism and the steps taken by the union, the issue of refugees, etc., demand cooperation of the union and the states. The Teesta river agreement in which West Bengal resented and the Srilankan naval attack on Tamil fisherman are examples to quote.
- The issue of cross-border terrorism and externally promoted insurgency demand coordinated action of the union and the state forces. This makes the cooperative federalism an essential.
- On the same lines the menace of the organized crimes and cybercrimes also reinforce the need for the strengthening of the cooperative federalism.
