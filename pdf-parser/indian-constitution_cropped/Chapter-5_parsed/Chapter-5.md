# INTRODUCTION

Part II of the constitution, between Articles 5 and 11 deals with citizenship. This is one of the provisions of the constitution that came into force immediately after the constituent assembly adopted the constitution in 1949. It was required to bring it to force before the commencement of the constitution, to conduct the election.

# Citizenship: Meaning

A 'citizen' is different from an 'alien'. Citizen of a state is one who enjoys all civil and political rights guaranteed by the constitution. Whereas an alien is not entitled to such rights. In case of a friendly alien, he may be entitled to certain civil rights including fundamental rights. However, an enemy alien may be deprived of such rights.

There are certain rights and constitutional privileges which are available only to citizens.

- Protection from discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth (Article 15).
- Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment (Article 16).
- Freedoms of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence and profession (Article 19).
- Cultural and educational rights of minorities (Articles 29 and 30).

# IMPORTANCE OF CITIZENSHIP

The constitution deals with citizenship in two different modes:

- 1. Before the commencement of the constitution.
- 2. After the commencement of the constitution.

The constitution deals with citizenship elaborately because:

• India being a republic, various constitutional offices are to be filled by the citizens only. Being a citizen of India, the primary qualification for holding the office of President or Prime Minister or members of Parliament, etc. Since the constitution provides only for a single citizenship it has to be unambiguously defined.

- The problems faced due to partition of the country which resulted in transmigration of people across the border. This demanded that the constitution must have adequate provisions to handle the situation.
- At the time of independence, a large number of Indians and PIO lived in other countries which complicated the problem.

### CITIZENSHIP BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION

The constitution contains certain provisions which deal with the citizenship before the commencement of the constitution. The following are the classes of citizenship dealt with by the constitution directly:

- Article 5: Citizenship by domicile
- Article 6: Right of citizenship of immigrants from Pakistan.
- Article 7: Right of citizenship of immigrants to Pakistan.
- Article 8: Right of citizenship of PIO living abroad.

# Article 5: Citizenship by Domicile

Domicilty is a legal status and does not possess any practical applicability. Domicile status depends on the place of ordinary residence of a person and his intention to reside and settle in the place permanently. Any person can become a citizen of India by domicilty if at the commencement of the constitution, he is domiciled in India and either:

- 1. He was born in the territory of India; or
- 2. Either of whose parents was born in the territory of India; or
- 3. Who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding commencement of the constitution.

Any person acquiring citizenship by this mode needs to take an oath of allegiance to the constitution of India.

#### Citizenship before Commencement of Constitution

Article 5: Citizenship by domicilty

Article 6: Right of citizenship of immigrants from Pakistan

Article 7: Right of citizenship of immigrants to Pakistan

Article 8: Right of citizenship of PIO living abroad

# Article 6: Right of Citizenship of Immigrants from Pakistan

Due to partition, India was divided into two and Pakistan was created. A citizen of united India was permitted to either remain in India or Pakistan or migrate to India from Pakistan or from Pakistan to India. The constitution guarantees the right to acquire the citizenship of India to any person who migrates from Pakistan.

However, the immigrants did not migrate and settle down in India. They either returned to Pakistan or transited through India. This became unmanageable. To resolve this, 'permit system' was introduced. Any person who migrates on or before 19 July 1948 will automatically become a citizen of India. However, any person who migrates after this date must have to register with the designated authority.

# Article 7: Right of Citizenship of Immigrants to Pakistan

Any citizen of India, who migrated to Pakistan, will lose his Indian citizenship automatically. However, if the same person returns back to India, then he shall have the right to get back his Indian citizenship. Irrespective of anything in Articles 5 or 6, he can acquire his Indian citizenship.

However, this provision will not be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. In case a permanent resident of the state of Jammu and Kashmir migrated to Pakistan returns to the state (any part of Jammu and Kashmir) under the permit for resettlement in that state or permanent return issued by or under the authority of any law made by the Jammu and Kashmir legislature, then shall be deemed to be a citizen of India.

# Article 8: Right of Citizenship of PIO Living Abroad

At the time of independence, there was a large population of Persons of Indian Origin living in many countries other than India. Many of they were transported to the respective countries as indentured labourers by the British Indian government. Article 8 of the Constitution provided an opportunity for such persons to acquire Indian citizenship. The constitution guarantees this as a right to such persons. However, article 9 provides that if such a person of Indian origin had acquired the citizenship of a foreign country, then they are not eligible to acquire citizenship of India.

According to Article 10,

- (a) a person who had acquired the Indian citizenship by domicile (Article 5)
- (b) an immigrant from Pakistan who has acquired citizenship of India (Article 6)
- (c) A citizen of India who had returned after migrating to Pakistan and acquired Indian Citizenship (Article 7)
- (d) A person of Indian origin who had acquired Indian citizenship (Article 8)

Will be subject to regulation of the law enacted by the Parliament. They do not enjoy any special status after the commencement of the constitution.

# CITIZENSHIP AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION

Article 11, of the constitution confers upon the Parliament, the power to enact law to regulate the affairs relating to citizenship. In accordance with the power, the Parliament has enacted the Citizenship Act, 1955. The law provides for five modes of acquiring citizenship and three modes of losing Indian citizenship.

# *Deprivation*

Deprivation is compulsory termination of citizenship. It is applicable only in cases of citizenship acquired by domicilty, registration or naturalization. The central government may, by order, deprive any such citizen of Indian citizenship, if it is satisfied that:

**RA 80** 

# OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIP OF INDIA SCHEME [1]

The Indian diaspora living abroad especially those living in the developed countries had been demanding for 'dual citizenship'. They had been demanding this to revive their link with India and stay connected. But the Constitution of India does not provide for 'dual citizenship'.

# PIO Card Scheme

Keeping in view of this demand the Government of India had introduced the 'PIO Card Scheme', in 1999, with aim of 'making the journey back to roots, simpler, easier, and flexible and absolutely hassle-free' for the PIO.

The scheme was an attempt to integrate the Indian diaspora and use their potential for the development of the country. Uniting and integrating the sizeable Indian diaspora would be mutually benefitting the community and the country. Opportunity to integrate the PIOs will give the PIOs

- A chance to revive their ancestral link with India and satisfy their psychological demand.
- Their knowledge resource can enable transfer of technology and experience much required for the industrial and economic growth of India
- Their economic capacity will benefitting India by bringing large scale investments to the economy.
- Many of the members of the Indian diaspora have been occupying higher positions, both politically and administratively in many countries. This will help India
  - **(a)** To conduct harmonious relationship with such countries.
  - **(b)** In the international forums.

Especially, when India is aspiring for an important role in the international politics, this support would be more significant.

| <b>NRI</b>                                                                                           | <b>Person of Indian Origin</b>                                                                                                                                                              | <b>OCI cardholder</b>                                                                                                    |
| An Indian citizen<br>who is ordinarily<br>residing outside<br>India and holds an<br>Indian passport. | A person who or whose any of<br>ancestors was an Indian national<br>and who is presently holding another<br>country's citizenship/nationality, i.e.,<br>he/she is holding foreign passport. | A person registered as Overseas<br>Citizen of India (OCI) Cardholder<br>under Section 7A of the Citizenship<br>Act. 1955 |

To go through the demand, the Government of India appointed a high powered committee under the chairmanship of L. M. Singhvi. The committee recommended for amending the Citizenship Act 1955, to accommodate the demand. Subsequently, the PIO card scheme introduced in 1999 was modified in 2002. Under the scheme any person becomes eligible to hold the PIO card if:

- 1. He/she held an Indian passport at any time; or
- 2. He/she or either of his/her parents or grandparents or great grandparents was
  - **i.** Born in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 and other territories that became part of India thereafter
  - **ii.** Permanently resident in India as defined in the Government of India Act, 1935 and other territories that became part of India thereafter
  - iii. Provided neither was at any time a citizen of any country as may be specified by central government from time to time; or
- 3. He/she is a spouse of a citizen of India or a PIO as mentioned above.

Thus, the scheme is broad-based, covers up to four generations and also the foreign spouse of a citizen of India or a PIO. Under the scheme, for a PIO cardholder, no visa is required for visiting India. He is exempt from the requirement of registration, if his stay on any single visit in India does not exceed 180 days. Parity with non-resident Indians in respect of facilities available to the latter in economic, financial and educational field is another benefit.

- 1. Who was a citizen of India at the time of, or at any time after the commencement of the constitution, i.e., 26 January 1950; or
