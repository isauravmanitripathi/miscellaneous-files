## INTRODUCTION

Emergency 'is a failure of social system to deliver reasonable conditions of life'.<sup>[1]</sup> It refers to the circumstances in which the public authorities are expected to take immediate action in response to certain sudden developments. Part XVIII of the Constitution of India between Articles 352 and 360 deal with emergency. The provisions enable the union government to centralize the powers to it and the system becomes completely unitary in nature. The constitution provides for three types of emergency namely:

| (i) National Emergency        | Article 352 |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| (ii) Constitutional Emergency | Article 356 |
| (iii) Financial Emergency     | Article 360 |

## NATIONAL EMERGENCY (ARTICLE 352)

Article 352 confers upon the President to proclaim the national emergency. The President can proclaim national emergency if he is satisfied that 'a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened, whether by war or external aggression or armed rebellion'.

According to the explanation to Article 352 (1), a Proclamation of National Emergency may be made even before the actual occurrence of war or of any such aggression or rebellion, if the President is satisfied that there is imminent danger thereof.

<sup>1</sup> Black Law's Dictionary

The Presidential satisfaction is not his singular satisfaction, but he has to make the proclamation only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President also has the power to make a subsequent proclamation revoking the Proclamation of Emergency.

#### Instruments of Cooperative Federalism

National emergency was proclaimed on ground of 'internal disturbance' in India in 1975 and lasted till 1977. The reasons quoted for proclaiming emergency were:

- The movement organized by Jayaprakash Narayan was seen as a threat to India's security and democracy.
- Unemployment, rising inflation and food scarcity resulting in protests and riots created the need for rapid economic growth.
- The threat of international intervention which could destabilize India.

## *Safeguards*

President can make a Proclamation of Emergency subjected to the following conditions:

- (a) The President can make the Proclamation of Emergency or varying that, only when the advice is signed by all the members of the Cabinet<sup> $(2)$ </sup> and communicated to him in writing.
- (b) Every proclamation issued has to be laid before Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha separately and the Houses must approve the proclamation. The proclamation has to be laid before the Houses within one month from date on which it was made.
- (c) The Houses of the Parliament need to approve the proclamation by a majority of total membership of the House and by majority of not less than two-thirds of members present and voting.
- (d) The proclamation will continue to remain in operation if approved by both the Houses and will cease to remain in operation even if any one of the Houses did not approve.
- (e) Once approved by the Houses, the proclamation will remain in force for a maximum period of six months from the date on which the proclamation was made. However, the proclamation can be extended beyond six months if approved by the Houses of the Parliament. Such extension must also be passed by a special majority.

#### Conflict between Government and Judiciary that led to Emergency

The Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament does not have the power to:

- Amend fundamental rights with an effect of abridging them.
- Amend the basic features of constitution.
- Restrict fundamental rights to implement DPSP.

**Provision for Special Session for the Approval of Proclamation:** The 44th amendment inserted the provision for a special session for disapproving the proclamation if the members of the Lok Sabha give their intention to the Speaker or the President.

Not less than one-tenth of the total number of members of Lok Sabha must sign and submit the notice expressing their intention to disapprove the proclamation to the Speaker, if the House is in session or the President, if the House is not in session.

<sup>2</sup> The term Cabinet is mentioned in Article 352, after the 44th Amendment Act. This is the only provision in which the term finds a mention.

On receipt of the notice of intention, a special sitting of the House must be held within fourteen days from the date on which such notice is received.

## Effects of Proclamation

When emergency is proclaimed:The federal system becomes a unitary system.

- Fundamental rights can be restricted or suspended.
- The courts cannot entertain petitions to enforce the fundamental rights if the right is suspended.
- Government can censor the newspapers and curtail freedom of press.
- During a financial emergency even, the salary of the judges of Supreme Court and high courts can be reduced.

**Effects of Proclamation:** Article 353 expressly provides for the following effects of the Proclamation of National Emergency:

- 1. According Article 353 (a), the union government will have the power to give binding directions to the States as to the exercise of their executive powers.
- 2. Article 353 (b) empowers the Parliament to make laws to confer powers or impose duties on the officers of the union, in respect of any matter, even if it is not a matter in Union List, in effect it means the State List.
- 3. According to Article 354, the President may issue an order to suspend the operation of any of provision of Articles 268–279. The suspension may remain in force for a period as specified in the order within the given financial year.
- 4. According to Article 250, the Parliament will have 'unlimited' powers to make law on any matter given in the State List. The power is unlimited because the Parliament can make the law for whole of India or any region. Any such law made will remain in force during the period when the proclamation remains in force.
- 5. According to Article 356 (5), the Proclamation of Constitutional Emergency already in force on any State can be extended in case a national emergency is proclaimed.
- 6. According to Article 358, when a Proclamation of National Emergency is made on the ground of war or external aggression, then the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 19 are automatically suspended.
- 7. Article 359 provides that the President can suspend the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights during when a Proclamation of National Emergency remains in operation. However, after the 44th amendment, the rights guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21 cannot be suspended.
- 8. The normal term of the House of People, can be extended for a period not more than one year by a law of the Parliament (Article 83). It provides that the term of five years 'may, while a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, be extended by Parliament by law for a period not exceeding one year at a time and not extending in any case beyond a period of six months after the proclamation has ceased to operate'.

## TABLE 23.1 National Emergency: Before 44th Amendment and After: A Comparison

## CONSTITUTIONAL EMERGENCY

Article 356 which provides for the constitutional emergency was inspired by Section 93 of the Government of India Act, 1935. While the 1935 Act vested the power in the Governor of the State, Article 356 confers the power on the President.

## Provision in Case of Failure of Constitutional Machinery in States

According to Article 356, the President can proclaim the constitutional emergency on the States in case of the 'breakdown of the constitutional machinery'. It provides that if at any time the President is satisfied that the administration of any State cannot be carried in accordance with the constitution, on the basis the report of the Governor or otherwise, then he can proclaim a constitutional emergency. The President may then:

- Assume to himself all or any of the functions of the government of the State.
- Assume to himself all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor other than the legislature of the State.
- Declare that the powers of the legislature of the State shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament.

## *Safeguards*

The Proclamation of Constitutional Emergency has to be laid before Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha for approval. The Houses need to approve the proclamation separately.

The proclamation must be laid for approval in the Parliament before two months from the date of proclamation.

Once approved, the proclamation will remain in operation for a maximum period of six months from the date of proclamation.

**Extension of the Proclamation:** The proclamation can be extended beyond six months subjected to the following conditions:

- If the continuance of the proclamation is approved by the Parliament, from the date on which it was approved. However, the proclamation cannot remain in force for more than three years or;
- The proclamation can be extended in case a Proclamation of National Emergency is made and becomes operational over the State which is already under constitutional emergency or;
- In case, the Election Commission certifies that the continuance of the constitutional emergency on account of the difficulties in holding free and fair elections.

However, by the 67th Amendment, the time limit of three years was extended to five years due to the insurgency of the Khalistan Movement.

**Articles 365 and 356:** The constitution confers upon the union government the power to issue directives that are binding on the States. Article 365, provides that it is 'lawful for the President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this constitution' in case any State failed to give effect to the directives issued by the Union. By this the President can proclaim the constitutional emergency over such State by the provisions of Article 356.

#### **Effects of Proclamation of State Emergency**

- When a Proclamation of State Emergency is made the powers of the State legislature shall be exercised by or under the authority of the Parliament.
- The Parliament is competent to confer on the President the power to make laws and delegate the power to any other authority.
- The Parliament or the President can confer the power or imposition of duties upon the union.
- The President can authorize the expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the State

#### *Issues involved*

While incorporating Article 356, the general expectation of the constituent assembly was that Article 356 would be resorted to only in unavoidable and extreme circumstances. The founding fathers of the constitution believed that it would not be invoked as a 'surgical operation for a mere cold or cataract'.[3] Dr Ambedkar hoped that Article 356 'will never be called into operation' and 'would remain a dead letter'.[4]

The most important issue is the Presidential satisfaction with regard to the 'failure of the constitutional machinery' in any State. The President exercises this power with the 'aid and advice' of his Council of Ministers and hence, it is the collective satisfaction of the Council and not the President alone. Hence, the political motive and mala fide intention in the Proclamation of the Constitutional Emergency cannot be ruled out. The proclamation could be made upon considerations that are wholly extraneous and irrelevant to the purpose for which Article 356 was incorporated.

The entire of gamut of this view is because of the President satisfying himself based on 'otherwise' than the report of the Governor. There have been several occasions in which the report of the Governor being got after the proclamation being made. In certain cases, the proclamation was made even when the Governor refused to make an adverse report and expressed satisfaction upon the performance of the State government. For example, in 1991 when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated, the then Governor of Tamil Nadu refused to make an adverse report and expressed satisfaction in the manner in which the State government was managing the crises resulting from the assassination, the union government invoked Article 356 and dismissed the government. Thus, the use of the power for political reasons is evident.

The next issue involved in this is the purpose of the article. The founding fathers provided Article 356, only as a step-in caution with the objective of protecting and preserving the territorial integrity of the nation. It was to correct any erring State and ensuring that the administration of the States is conducted in accordance with the constitution. But the reality after the constitution coming into force is completely different and the provision has been used 'liberally' that it had worked against the spirit of the constitution. Dr Ambedkar said in his Constituent Assembly speech, 'the first thing the President will do would be to issue a mere warning to a province that has erred, that things were not happening in the way in which they were intended to happen in the Constitution. ...' However, in the past, there have been many occasions in which Article 356 was invoked and the State governments being toppled without any warnings. The dismissal of S. R. Bommai headed government in Karnataka in 1988 is an example. Though, Bommai the Chief Minister of Karnataka pleaded for a chance to prove the majority on the floor of the House, the government was dismissed invoking Article 356. This resulted in challenging the use of Article 356 in the Karnataka High Court. Later, in 1992 with the dismissal of the BJP governments in States other than UP in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition, the Supreme Court took the case to itself and decided.

#### **S. R. Bommai Case Ruling:** In the landmark judgement, the Supreme Court ruled that:

(a) The Proclamation of Constitutional Emergency under Article 356 is subjected to judicial review. The President satisfies himself only on the advice of the Council of Ministers and so the *mala fide* is not ruled out. However, it was argued that the advice of the Council of Ministers under Article 74(2) cannot be questioned in a court of law. The court ruled that the constitution 'does not bar the court to call upon the union government to disclose the material upon which the President had formed the requisite satisfaction'.[5] The court held that the 'material on the basis of which the advice was tendered' does not form part of the advice.

### Sarkaria Commission on Article 356

President's Rule can be imposed in case of:

- Political crises
- Internal subversion
- • Physical breakdown
- Non-compliance with constitutional directions of the union executive
- (b) The court ruled that neither the Governor nor the President shall take any action that is irreversible until the proclamation was laid before the Parliament and approved by it. For instance, the Legislative Assembly of the State must not be dissolved until the proclamation was approved by the Parliament.
- (c) If needed the Assembly can be held in suspended animation (in a state of freeze) so as to prevent it from taking any unauthorized action.
- (d) In case the court was satisfied that the proclamation was made with *mala fide* intentions, the court will have the power to restore the *status quo ante*, that is the status before the proclamation was made. For instance, the court can restore the government back to power. In 1998, the Kalyan Singh Government was restored back by the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court. Similarly, in 2016 the court restored the Government of Arunachal Pradesh.
- (e) The court also ruled that the right forum to test the confidence of the Council of Ministers is the floor of the Legislative Assembly. The majority support of the Council must not be determined on the subjective assessment of the Governor.
- (f) Before making the proclamation, the State government must be given adequate opportunity to present its case of defence.
- (g) In cases where there are law and order problems in any State, the Union must provide all possible support at its disposal to the State before deciding to make the proclamation.
- (h) The court also ruled that certain circumstances arising out of:
  - Stringent financial crisis in the State
  - Problem of rampant corruption in the State
  - Poor performance of the ruling party of the State in the Lok Sabha elections
  - Intra-party crisis, etc.

Must not be viewed as failure of constitutional machinery and Article 356 be invoked.

#### Rameshwar Prasad Case

The Supreme Court ruled that:

- • Dissolving the assembly even before the first meeting of the Legislative Assembly on the ground of horse trading.
- It was not the constitutional power of the Governor.

**Is Article 356 against Federal Principle?:** Article 356 is inspired by the British enacted Government of India Act 1935, by which the British intended to provide 'controlled democracy' or 'restricted democracy' to India. But the founding fathers of the constitution did not intend to import such restricted democracy. 'The socio-political experience of the framers of the constitution made them acutely aware that security of the nation and the stability of its polity could not be taken for granted. The road to democracy was not expected to be smooth. The vast difference in social, economic and political life, the diversity in languages, race and region were expected to present the nascent republic with many a difficult situation.' $(6)$  Hence, they have chosen to incorporate Article 356.

### Do You Know?

- Constitutional emergency was first imposed in Punjab in 1951.
- Secondly it was imposed in Kerala in 1957.
- In 1986, President's rule was imposed on ground of terrorism and insurgency.

The constitution establishes a 'cooperative federalism'. The spirit of cooperative federalism demands an unconditional cooperation between the union and the States for promoting the welfare of the people. The attitude of dominance would only spoil the objective. Neither can attempt to dominate for 'sovereignty doesn't lie in any one institution or in any one wing of the government'.<sup>[7]</sup> The distributed power is essential for promoting good governance. Hence, it is to be realized that the power vested in the union to control the States must be used in its true spirit. Such powers must not be used except for achieving the purpose for which they are provided. Article 356 is one such power.

But over a period of time, it is found that Article 356 is subjected to gross abuse. The Sarkaria Commission observed that 'the State governments were dismissed even when they enjoyed the majority in the Assembly; on some occasions, they were dismissed without giving them an opportunity to prove their strength on the floor of the House. Hence, the flaw does not lie in the very provision but the manner in which it subjected to use.

#### **Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery: Meaning[8]**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Discuss the meaning of 'breakdown of constitutional machinery'. What are its effects? *IAS MAINS GS (2004)* 

It is the condition in which the administration of a State cannot be carried in accordance with the constitution and such condition may arise due to:

Firstly, it could mean a circumstance in which there is a severe law and order problem, which could not be controlled even after exhausting all possible methods and means with the State and the union.

Secondly, if after the general election to the State legislature, a stable government could not be formed either due to the hung assembly or any difficulty in running the incumbent government.

Thirdly, if a Proclamation of National Emergency is made over any State which is already under State emergency, then it can be extended beyond six months [Article356 (5)].

Fourthly, if the Election Commission certifies that the conditions in a State were not conducive for the conduct of free and fair elections [Article 356(5)].Fifthly, according to Article 365, if any State failed to give effect to any directive issued by the union, such conditions are referred to as 'breakdown of the constitutional machinery'.

On the other hand, the following circumstances must not be construed as 'breakdown of the constitutional machinery'. Such circumstances arising out of:

- Stringent financial crisis in the State
- Problem of rampant corruption in the State
- Poor performance of the ruling party of the State in the Lok Sabha elections
- Intra-party crisis, etc.

## FINANCIAL EMERGENCY: ARTICLE 360

Article 360 provides for the financial emergency. 'If the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or credit of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened'<sup>(9)</sup>, he may proclaim Financial Emergency.

The proclamation has to be laid before each House of the Parliament within two months from the date of proclamation. If approved by the Houses the proclamation will remain in operation until revoked. The duration of the proclamation is not provided in the constitution. The Proclamation of Financial Emergency has not been made ever since the coming into force of the constitution.

## *Effects of Proclamation*

During when the proclamation is in operation, the union government has the powers to issue directives to the States to 'observe such canons of financial propriety'.

- (a) The President may issue such directions to the State as he may deem fit.
- (b) The President may require the States to reserve all the Money Bills for his consideration.
- (c) The President may issue direction reducing the salary and allowances of all persons serving in the State government.
- (d) The President may also reduce the salary and allowances of all persons serving in the union government including the judges of Supreme Court and high courts.
