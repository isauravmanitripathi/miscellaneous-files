# INTRODUCTION

Article 74 of the constitution provides for the Council of Ministers. It provides that, 'there shall be a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the President'. The Council of Ministers is a constitutional body as it provided by the constitution itself. The Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head is the real executive. The importance of the Council of Ministers is that the President cannot exercise his powers without the advice of the Council.

# COMPOSITION

The Council of Ministers comprises the Prime Minister and other ministers. Once the Prime Minister is appointed the Council of Ministers is said to have come into existence. Other ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The President is bound by the advice of the Prime Minister and he does not have any choice in this regard [Article 75 (1)].

By the Constitution (91st Amendment) Act, 2003, Article 75 (1A) was inserted. It sets the limit to the size of the Council of Ministers. According to Article 75, the total number of ministers in the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the total number of members of the House of the People.

The Council of Ministers hold office during the pleasure of the President [Article 75 (2)]. However, in reality they hold office during the pleasure of the Prime Minster as the advice of the Prime Minister is binding on the President. Hence, the Prime Minister has the powers to shuffle his ministerial pack any time.

|--|--|--|--|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
|--|--|--|--|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|

The Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to the House of People. That is, the Council can remain in power as long as it enjoys the confidence of the House. They are also individually responsible to the Houses of the Parliament under the concept of ministerial responsibility.<sup> $(1)$ </sup>

At the time of independence, the Council of Ministers had a five-tiered (ranks) structure namely member of cabinet, minster of cabinet rank, Minister of State, deputy ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Later with the recommendations of the Gopalaswamy Ayyangar Committee, it was made a threetiered structure. At present, the council comprises ministers of three ranks namely, member of cabinet, Minister of State and deputy ministers.

However, the constitution does not differentiate between the ministers. Article 75 (6), empowers the Parliament to determine the salary and allowances of the ministers, does not distinguish between the different categories of the ministers. Hence, all members of the Council of Ministers including the Prime Minister, enjoy equal constitutional status.

# COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND CABINET

| Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below: |                     |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--|
| State the difference between Council of Ministers and the cabinet.           | IAS MAINS GS (2003) |  |

While the Council of Ministers is a constitutional body, the cabinet is an extraconstitutional body. 'Cabinet' did not find any mention in the original constitution. But the 44th amendment gave a constitutional recognition by including the term in Article 352. Cabinet is a subset of the Council, which comprises the ministers who are of the cabinet rank.

In practice, cabinet is synonymously used to mention the Council of Ministers. This is because the decisions made by the cabinet are binding on the Council. Rarely the full Council of Ministers meet and only the cabinet makes all the important decision.

The ministers of the cabinet rank head the ministries/departments and are independent. Whereas, the Ministers of State hold only such departments and are in-charge of such functions allocated to them by the cabinet ministers. Thus, they work under the cabinet ministers.

#### Interesting Facts

- Administrative Reforms Commission (1966) recommended for the ceiling in the strength of the Council of Ministers.
- • While Council of Ministers is a constitutional body, the cabinet is an extraconstitutional body.
- Article 352 is the only article of the constitution in which the term 'Cabinet' is mentioned.

<sup>1</sup> Refer chapter on the salient features of the constitution.

The deputy minsters discharge such functions as deputed by the cabinet minister under whom they work. They assist the cabinet minister. In case the cabinet minister is unable to be present in the House in which some question relating to his portfolio is raised, he may direct the deputy minister to answer on his behalf.

# Is the Cabinet a Dictator and Omnipotent?

Given the powerful position of the cabinet it appears that the 'Cabinet' enjoys a dictatorial position and is apparently omnipotent. However, when one takes a close look the position is different. Though the 'cabinet dictatorship' is real it is not omnipotent to do whatever it likes to.

'Cabinet is the creature that leads its own creator' *Herman Finer*

The cabinet enjoys this clout and dictatorial position due to the proximity of the Prime Minister and its composition. The heavy weights of the party in power in the union and the politically important leaders of the party are the members of the cabinet. Hence, the cabinet is very influential. However, the cabinet is not omnipotent and cannot function independently due to the following reasons:

The decisions of the cabinet are not final and they have to be approved by the Parliament. On the floor of the Houses of the Parliament, the decisions are subjected to thorough scrutiny. This, in turn, triggers public discourse on the issue. Hence, the cabinet is subjected to public accountability.

Secondly, any decision of the cabinet needs to be in conformity with the provisions of the constitution. The decisions are subjected to judicial review and the Supreme Court and the High courts can declare any decision of the cabinet invalid, if the court finds it to be ultra vires the constitution.

Thirdly, the cabinet is bound by the need for going back to the people for their mandate after its term expires through election. At that time, the cabinet will lose its face, if its decisions were not made with consideration of peoples' welfare.

Fourthly, the cabinet does not enjoy any power, but it is only a 'delegate' of the President. The cabinet is only to advice the President and all decisions are expressed to taken in the name of the President [Article 77 (1)]. Hence, the President can vet the decision and return the decision for reconsideration. In such circumstances the Council has to reconsider the decision. In the past, a healthy convention of discarding the decision returned by the President for reconsideration has been well established. When Dr Kalam as President returned the advice of the Council to proclaim constitutional emergency on Bihar, the then government chose to discard the advice. From the foregoing points it is clear that, 'although the cabinet dictatorship is a stark reality, the cabinet is not omnipotent. $(2)$ 

# 'Minimum Government Maximum Governance' – an Analysis

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'Though the dictatorship of the cabinet is a stark reality in modern times, it does not mean that the cabinet is omnipotent'. Comment. *IAS MAINS Public Administration Paper II (2000)* 

The size of the cabinet should be as big governmental work justifies and as big as the Prime Minister can manage as a team. How far the efficacy of a government then is inversely related to the size of the cabinet? Discuss *IAS Mains (GS Paper II) (2014)*

<sup>2</sup> Indian Public Administration: Institutions and Issues Ramesh. K. Arora and Rajni Goyal: The statement was asked as a question in 2000 (Public Administration Paper II).

#### SMART Government

To achieve the maximum governance the government needs to be a 'SMART' government

- S-Simple
- • M-Moral
- A-Accountable
- R-Responsive
- • T-Transparent

In 2014, after assuming the charge as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi declared that his focus would be on the quality of governance by keeping the size of the government small but efficient. 'Government has no business in business' was the watchword of this idea. It means to rollback the government from economic and commercial activities. The government must permit the private players to take the role wherever they are willing and possible. The government thus, must minimize its role in the market and shall only be a regulator, facilitator and promoter. According to the Government of India, the 'maximum governance' is to:

- (a) Establish a government that is citizen friendly and accountable.
- (b) Simplify the procedures.
- (c) Identify and repeal obsolete/archaic laws/rules and rationalizing existing rules.
- (d) Using technology to usher in a transparent administration that is capable of delivering services at a faster pace. This is to achieved through 'Digital India' scheme.
- (e) An effective public grievance redressal mechanism.
- (f) Keep the decision-making level in the government at a minimum and setting up platform for promoting interaction with the citizens and get the advice from the citizen in order to make policy need-based.

The concept means to have the number of executive departments at a minimum. This would reduce the size of the human resource and would result in a right-sized administration. The right-sized administration will be more responsive and efficient. It will also reduce the financial burden of the government. The financial resource thus, conserved can be utilized for other purposes such welfare programmes.

The concept also entails having a simple administration which will have simplified procedures that are less difficult to understand for the common man and enable compliance. This will increase the confidence of the citizen on the government and makes the system more citizen-friendly.

It further means the citizen must have easy access to the administrators and the administration. This must be possible both in case of the citizen being able to tell his needs to the policy-makers and also get the grievances appropriately redressed within reasonable time and cost.

On the other hand, the idea of minimum government, maximum governance must not be equated with a smaller size of the Council of Ministers or cabinet. After the Constitution (91st Amendment) Act, 2003, there is a ceiling in the maximum size of the Council imposed by the constitution. Hence, it is not essential to further reduce the size of the Council. The size of the Council and cabinet must be optimized according to the need of the government, functions that the government is called to perform and the ability of the Prime Minister to handle the Council.

If the Council is too small, then the minsters would be overburdened and the efficiency of the government will be lost. In 2014, when the NDA government took charge, the strength of the Council of Ministers was 46 which were much less than sanctioned by the constitution. Thus, many ministers were entrusted with more than one portfolio. For instance, the Finance Minister was holding defence portfolio as well as finance. This is not a workable arrangement. Thus, the Prime Minister reshuffled the Council and today the Council is 76 strong.

Thus, it may clear from the foregoing that the idea of 'Minimum Government Maximum Governance' does not have any relation with the size of the Council of Ministers or the cabinet.

# Qualification to be Minister

The constitution does not prescribe any qualification to be a minister. However, to be a minister a person has to be a member of Parliament—either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. It is not required for any person to be a member of Parliament at the time of appointment as a minister. But he has to be a member of Parliament within six months from the date on which enters upon the office as minister [Article 75 (5)].

According to Article 75 (1B), inserted by 93rd amendment, any member of Parliament who has been disqualified on ground of defection must not be appointed as a minister. This prohibition is for the 'duration of the period commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or where he contests any election to either House of Parliament before the expiry of such period, till the date on which he is declared elected, whichever is earlier'.

# PORTFOLIO SYSTEM

India follows the cabinet form of government in which the government business is allocated to various ministers. Article 77 (3) empowers the President to allocate the business of the government among ministers. This system is known as 'portfolio system'. Thus, each minister will be in-charge of one or more department.

However, in reality the allocation is the prerogative of the Prime Minister. The President is bound by the advice of the Prime Minister. Hence, the Prime Minister can at any time alter the portfolio of the ministers.

In this system, a minister who holds a particular ministry will be responsible for various activities concerning the ministry. He is responsible for the introduction of various bills, policies, demand for grants, etc., and answering any question relating to the ministry, raised on the floor of the House.

# Functions of the Council of Minsters

The Council performs three types of functions namely—legislative, executive and financial.

### *Legislative Functions*

The Council of Ministers due to the support of the majority members of the Lok Sabha has good control over the Parliament. The Council formulates the policies and budget of the government, presents them to the Parliament and secures the approval for implementation. All the important legalizations are initiated by the ministers and got approved.

#### Exercise of Executive Powers

The government may do any act provided: It is not an act assigned by the constitution to any other authority or body such as the legislature or the judiciary or the Public Service Commission.

- (a) It is not contrary to the provisions of the constitution, or of any law.
- (b) It does not encroach upon or otherwise infringe the legal rights of an individual.
- (c) It does not involve payment of any money to any foreign power.
- (d) The powers required for carrying out a policy are not available from the existing law.

(e) Where the constitution says that an act may be done only by legislation.

'Committee to identify the Central Acts which are not relevant or no longer needed or require repeal/re-enactment in the present socio-economic context',

**RA 80** 

#### *Executive Functions*

The Council of Ministers is the executive of the union. According to Article 53, the term 'officers subordinate to President' includes the Council of Ministers. The Council provides 'aid and advice' to the President. The Council by way of 'aid' discharge the responsibilities delegated to them by the President. The ministers head the departments and are the political heads of the department and are responsible for the functioning of the ministries. They are accountable to the people through the Parliament.

The Council also advices the President in discharge his functions and exercise of his powers. Any advice tendered to the President by the Council of Minsters is not subjected to judicial review [Article 74 (2)]. The Council also brings coordination among the policies of various departments.

#### *Financial Functions*

The Council controls the financial administration and the policy relating to them. All major economic and financial decisions are made by the Council.

# COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND THE PRESIDENT

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'Presidents of India prior to the passage of 42nd and 44th amendment could afford to be more assertive'. Comment *IAS MAINS Public Administration Paper II* 

According to Article 74, the Council of Ministers is to aid and the advice the President. Until 1976, the President had some amount of discretion with respect to accepting the advice of the Council. However, the 42nd amendment made the advice of the Council binding on the President. This made the President to just endorse the decisions of the Council and made him a mere rubber stamp of the Council. But this was not the position envisaged by the founding fathers of the constitution.

This anomaly was, to some extent, set right by the 44th amendment. The 44th amendment inserted the proviso to Article 74 (1), which enables the President to return the advice of the Council for reconsideration once. When the President returns any advice for reconsideration, the Council has to reconsider and advice the President accordingly. The advice tendered by the Council after such reconsideration is binding on the President.

44th amendment did not fully restore the pre-1976 position of the President. This has a constitutionally significant reason. In the pre-1976 position the President had the discretion to either accept

#### TABLE 12.2 Longest and shortest serving Prime Ministers

or reject the advice of the Council and act according to his discretion. This will completely breach the 'checks and balances' system that the constitution seeks to establish. The President then could get the advice of the Council to satisfy the condition imposed by Article 74 and might choose to discard and make a decision of his own discretion. This creates a position in which the President can become a dictator. In order to prevent this eventuality, the 44th amendment did not restore the pre-1976 position of the President, but just provided him the power to return the advice for reconsideration once.

# PRIME MINISTER

The Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers and is the leader of the nation. He is the pivot of the government system. The office has been borrowed from English parliamentary system.

# Appointment of the PM

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:* Do you justify the Prime Minister's entry into Parliament through Rajya Sabha?

*IAS MAINS GS (2000)* 

The Prime Minister is appointed by the President. Usually the President appoints the leader of the party that enjoys the majority support of the Lok Sabha as the PM. When any one party emerges out with the required majority in the House, the President will not be facing any challenge in the appointment of the PM.

However, in case of a hung Parliament in which no political party gains the required majority the President has to apply his discretion. In such circumstances, the President follows a convention. He invites the leader of the single largest party in the Lok Sabha to form the government. When he fails to form the government, President may call the leader of the alliance of parties formed before the election. In case the alliance also fails to make, only then he appoints the leader of the post-election alliance.

This convention was evolved to avoid the 'horse-trading', in which the members of Parliament keep shifting their loyalty and support to different political groups for 'considerations' like money, power, ministerial berth, etc.

The PM like other ministers needs to be a member of Parliament. However, he need not to be a member of Parliament at the time of appointment. Also, the constitution does not bar the PM being a member of either House of the Parliament. However, the PM being a member of Lok Sabha is considered more appropriate than he being a member of Rajya Sabha. This is on the moral ground as the PM is the leader of the nation and he needs to be representing the people rather than any State.

#### Horse-trading: What does it mean?

#### In Business

It means informal negotiations involving hard bargaining and different levels of compromises.

#### In Politics

It refers to the phenomenon of luring members of Parliament or State Legislative Assembly from one party to another with money, posts, etc., *in lieu* of their support.

#### In India

- • It is popularly and comically known as '*Aya Ram and Gaya Ram*'.
- In 1967, the Haryana MLA Gaya Lal switched his support thrice in 15 days and finally settled with Indian National Congress.
- • Congress leader Rao Birendra Singh was the first to use this phrase when he said '*Gaya Ram is now Aya Ram*'.

The PM also holds office during pleasure of the President but the President cannot withdraw his pleasure unless certain conditions are satisfied. The President may withdraw his pleasure and remove the Prime Minister if:

- (i) The PM fails to prove his majority support on the floor of Lok Sabha.
- (ii) The PM loses the confidence vote and refuses to resign.
- (iii) A no confidence motion is carried against the Council of Ministers.
- (iv) If the term of Lok Sabha expires and the PM refuses to resign and advices the President to call for elections.

# Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'The Prime Minister stands out as the most powerful authority even today'. Comment. *IAS MAINS Public Administration (2001)* 

The PM enjoys the status of *primus inter pares*, first among the equals with respect to his Council of Ministers. The Prime minster is the head of the Council of Ministers (Article 74). It implies that the Council must always be headed by the PM.

Once the Prime Minister appointed the Council of Ministers is said to have come into force. He is the kingpin of the Council and it sails or sink with the Prime Minister. In case of any difference of opinion between any minister and the Prime Minister, then the minister has to change resolve it in accordance with the PM's view or he has to resign.

The Prime Minister's choice of the membership of the Council is final and the President has to appoint the ministers in accordance with the recommendation of the PM. Similarly, the President allocates the portfolios to the ministers in accordance with the recommendation of the PM.

After allocating the portfolios to other ministers, the PM holds the all of the rest portfolios. This is known as 'Residuary Portfolios' and the PM is known as 'Resort of Residual Legatee'.

The Council of Ministers, in practice, hold office during the pleasure of the PM. In case the PM wants to reshuffle his Council at any time, he is free to do. He can either direct any of his ministers to resign or in case they refuse he can advise the President to 'withdraw his pleasure' and remove the minister. Thus, even today the PM stands out to be most powerful.

#### Deputy Prime Minister

- The constitution does not provide for the post of Deputy PM.
- It is created according to the political contingencies.
- Though known as Deputy PM, the post does not carry any responsibility.
- Under the Council of Ministers Act, 1952, the Deputy PM is equal to other ministers.
- • Since independence there have been seven Deputy PMs namely Vallabhbhai Patel, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Jagjivan Ram, Yashwantrao Chavan, Devi Lal and Lal Krishna Advani.

On the other hand, it is not that the PM is omnipotent and can be a dictator. He is bound by several conditions and constraints—both constitutional and political, in respect of the Council of Ministers such as:

(i) Article 75 (1A) imposes a ceiling on the strength of the Council of Ministers.

- (ii) The PM has to accommodate the party heavy weights in the Council of Ministers appropriately.
- (iii) He has to distribute the seats in the Council in accordance with the vote share of various region of the country.
- (iv) He needs to take into account the representation of all communities, especially the minorities, women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Council.

- (v) He needs to take into account the representation of certain regions like the North East in the Council.
- (vi) Above all he needs to consider the capability of the persons who are appointed as ministers and their background—political, criminal, etc., while appointing them as ministers.

This is all the more difficult in a coalition era. The PM will have to accommodate the wishes and demands of the coalition partners while constituting the Council. Especially, when the coalition partner is important and is crucial for the survival of the government, the burden on the PM is very heavy. Thus, the PM is very much constrained and cannot have a free hand in determining the composition of the Council of Ministers.

Further, the constitution does not confer any powers to the PM directly. All the powers what he exercises are the powers vested in the President. The exercise of such powers is also subjected to the constitutional provisions, approval of the Parliament and is also subjected to judicial review. Hence, in spite of all the powers, the PM cannot become a dictator.

# Understanding the Office of PM

TABLE 12.3 Funds Under PM

Although the position of the PM is described through phrases like *primus inter pares*, one can understand the office only by observing the evolution of the office. The office of the PM has been evolving and it is closely associated with the personality and charisma of the PM. The importance of the office had varied due to the personality and the charisma of the incumbent. Accordingly, the Indian Prime Ministers can be classified into two categories namely those who were more than *primus inter pares* and those who were less than *primus inter pares*.

Jawaharlal Nehru, Indra Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and the present PM Narendra Modi can be included in the first category. These PMs enjoyed greater charisma and popularity, as a result of which they had been able to influence the electoral performance of the party to which they belonged. Their ability to guide their party to electoral winning had given them a stronger hold over their party and they were hardly challenged by their party colleagues. They could play more decisive role with respect to the decisions of the government and the party.

On the other hand, PMs like Lal Bahadur Shastri, Morarji Desai, P. V. Narashima Rao, Vajpayee, I. K. Gujral, Deve Gowda and Dr Manamohan Singh belong to the second category. For many reasons they were not having strong hold over the office and the party. Lal Bahadur Shastri took over as Prime Minister immediately after Nehru who was towering personality both at the national and international level. Hence, he needed to consolidate his position. Similarly, P. V. N. Rao became the PM at the time when the country was facing a crisis and hence, he also faced several hurdles. Also, Congress party was not having its own majority to form the government and he was more dependent on his alliance partners. The other three Prime Ministers were heading a coalition government and were subjected to the pulls and pressures of the coalition partners.

**...** 

Such PMs who did not enjoy that much charisma attempted to strengthen their position by several means. One of the means is to strengthen the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), previously called as Prime Minister's Secretariat. For instance, when Vajpayee was the PM, the National Security Commission and the office of the National Security Advisor (NSA) were established. The Principal Secretary to the PMO was made the ex-officio NSA which resulted in the concentration of power in the PMO and effectively in the PM. However, when the Congress head UPA alliance government was formed in 2004, the PMO and NSA were separated. This resulted in the weakening of the PM. Later in 2014 when the BJP emerged as the single largest party with the required majority to form the government, the alliance partners of the party in the present National Democratic Alliance do not have much leverage over the government. This overwhelming electoral win is attributed to the PM Modi's charisma and he has now emerged as a stronger PM. This has been reinforced with the subsequent electoral gains in State election, especially the BJP winning in the UP state elections in 2017.

Thus, it is better to understand the office of PM, by examining how the office has actually evolved over time rather than describing the Prime Minister's position through phrases.<sup>[5]</sup>
