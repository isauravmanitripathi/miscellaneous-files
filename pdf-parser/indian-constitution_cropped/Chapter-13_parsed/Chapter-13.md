# INTRODUCTION

The Constitution of India provides for parliamentary form of government in both Centre and the States. Hence, the State government also consists of a titular head and a real head. The titular head of the State is the Governor and the real head is the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as its head. All the 29 states in India have the uniform structure of government.

# OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

Article 153, provides that 'there shall be a Governor for each State'. This is similar to the provision corresponding to the office of the President. The Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, inserted the proviso to Article 153, which provides for the appointment of the Governor of a State, as the Governor of any other State or administrator of any union territory in case of the occurrence of a casual vacancy in the State or Union Territory.

Where the same person is appointed as Governor of two or more States, the emoluments and allowances payable to the Governor shall be allocated among the States in such proportion as the President may by order determine [Article 158 (2)].

# Appointment and Term of Office

| Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below: |                       |  |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--|--|
| Is there any provision to impeach the Governor of a State?                   | IAS MAINS - GS - 1999 |  |  |

The Governor of a State is appointed by the President under his hand and seal. The President exercises the power to appoint the Governor only on the advice of the union Council of Ministers. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President—Article 156. The constitution does not specify on what grounds the President may withdraw his pleasure. The President may 'withdraw' his pleasure on the advice of the union Council of Ministers. Thus, in effect the Governor is appointed by and holds office during the pleasure of the Prime Minister. This has resulted in the rise of controversies.

The Governor may at any time resign from office by writing under his hand addressed to the President. Subjected to these conditions the Governor holds office for a period of five years from the date on which he enters upon the office. However, the Governor will continue to remain in office, even after the expiration of the term, until his successor enters upon office. $[1]$ 

In case of any casual vacancy of the office of the Governor on any other reason than removal, resignation or death then the President has the power to determine how the functions of the office (Article 160).

# Qualifications and Conditions of Office

To be appointed as Governor any person need to be a citizen of India and must have completed thirtyfive years of age (Article 157).

According to Article 158, the Governor must be a member of state legislature or a member of Parliament. Here, it is to be noted that the constitution does not bar any member of state legislature or a member of Parliament being appointed as Governor. But if a member of state legislature or a member of Parliament is appointed as the Governor, then his seat in the House will automatically fall vacant on the date on which he enters upon the office of the Governor.<sup>[2]</sup>

Article 158 (2) provides that the Governor must not hold any office of profit during his term as Governor. The Governor is entitled to a rent-free official residence, the residence of the Governor is known as *Raj Bhavan*. The emoluments, allowances and privileges of the Governor are as fixed by the law of the Parliament.

The emoluments and allowances of the Governor shall not be diminished during his term of office. This is to ensure the independence and the dignity of the office of the Governor.

#### Appointed Governor: Reasons

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What were the two major considerations to have the appointed and not elected?

*IAS MAINS GS (2008)* 

The draft constitution contained a provision for elected Governor. However, later the constituent assembly provided for the 'appointed' Governor. The reasons for the constitution providing for an appointed Governor are given below.

Firstly, if the Governor was also to be elected, then it will result in another election. Since, the Governor is only a nominal head, the election to the office will be contested on personal issues. This is would result in unnecessary tarnishing of his image which would be inappropriate to the dignity of the office.

1 Article 156

<sup>2</sup> IAS prelims question

Secondly, it would involve a huge exercise involving the people without any fruitful outcome.

Thirdly, the election involves huge costs—administrative, social, and financial and other, which is unnecessary considering the powers vested in the office of the Governor.

Fourthly, the constitution envisages the role of a nominal head to the Governor. It is inappropriate to make the Governor, after being elected by the people directly, a nominal head. In case the Governor to be elected by the people directly, then he may not prefer to be a nominal head. It will not be appropriate to make the Chief Minister representing a constituency the head of the government.

Fifthly, in such cases the Governor might demand a more meaningful position; he may aspire to become a Minister or Chief Minister with effective powers. This would detrimentally affect the constitutional scheme.

Sixthly, the Governor is not only the head of the State but also the agent of the Centre and through the Governor the Centre exercises control over the State. The President appointing the Governor makes the control effective.

Seventhly, the Governor needs to be detached from the active politics of the State in order to be neutral. In case of election to his office, this political neutrality could be affected.

Although these arguments are acceptable, there are equally strong arguments against 'appointed' Governor. A Governor nominated by the Centre, may not have adequate understanding about the State, its culture, political dynamics, etc. Hence, he may not be able to discharge his responsibilities effectively. In all the federal systems the Governor of the provinces are elected. India being a federal system must also have the Governor elected.

It is sometimes argued that the elected Governor does not conform to the parliamentary system. This argument is not acceptable because the union President is also elected. When it is possible to have an elected President as the nominal head, a similar system could be thought out for the Governor also.

The possibility of misunderstanding and resultant friction between Governor and the Chief Minister is not acceptable as it can happen with the nominated Governor.

#### Governor: Importance of the Office

According to the Sarkaria Commission, Governor is a 'bridge' between the Union and the State who can foster better understanding between them. It is his duty to inform the Union about the affairs of the State Administration. This is more important 'whenever he feels that matters are not going in accordance with the constitution, or there are developments endangering the security or integrity of the country'. Thus, the Governor assists the Union in discharging its responsibilities towards the States. The part which the Governor plays to help to maintain the democratic form of Government in accordance with the constitution is of vital importance. 'He therefore, is sentinel of the constitution'.<sup>[3]</sup>

The Governor plays a pivotal role in our constitutional system and in its working. He is the linchpin of the constitutional apparatus of the State.[4] Important functions of Governor are given below:

- (a) All executive action of the State government is expressed to be taken in name of Governor.
- (b) He chooses and appoints the Chief Minister in his discretion, on the criterion that the latter should be able to form a Ministry commanding majority support in the Assembly without his assent, no bill can become law.
- (c) Without his prior authorization no Money Bill can be introduced in the state legislature.
- (d) Without his orders, the House or Houses of State legislature cannot be summoned or prorogued. It is he who orders dissolution of Legislative Assembly, sometimes in his discretion when satisfied after exploring all alternatives that there is no person commanding majority support in the Assembly to form a Council of Ministers.
- (e) A large number of other important functions have also been entrusted by the constitution to the Governor. It is not necessary to recapitulate all of them here.

# Office of the Governor: Issues Involved

The controversy relating to the office of the Governor is prevalent since independence. The office is considered as the British creation and the State Chief Ministers deplored and demanded the abolition of the office. It is one of the non-federal features of the constitution.

#### *Issue 1: Appointment of Governor*

The appointment and the removal of the Governor has been a controversy since then. The Sarkaria Commission focussing on the role of the Governor, made the following recommendations regarding the appointment of the Governor:

- (a) He should be a man of some eminence in some field.
- (b) He should not belong to the State where he has to serve as the Governor.
- (c) He should be a detached figure with little record of participation in the local politics of the State.
- (d) He should be a person who has not taken too great a part in politics generally, particularly in the recent past.
- (e) Preference should continue to be given to the minority groups as hitherto.
- (f) It is desirable that a politician from the ruling party at the Centre should not be made the Governor of a State run by another party or a coalition of parties.
- (g) Article 155 of the constitution should be suitably amended to ensure effective consultation with the Chief Minister of a State while appointing a Governor in that State.
- (h) The Vice-President of India and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha should also be consulted while making this appointment though this consultation should be 'confidential', 'informal' and not a matter of constitutional obligations.

#### *Issue 2: Discretionary Powers of Governor*

Founding fathers of the constitution had vested the 'discretionary powers' in the Governor with the confidence that he would use such powers rationally according to the need of the circumstances. Opposed to this expectation the Governors had exercised the powers 'dictatorially'. They had attempted to satisfy the union government for political reasons which are not the constitutional obligations of the office.

Article 164 provides that the Chief Minister shall be appointed by the Governor and other ministers are to be appointed by the Governor on the recommendations of the Chief Minister. They hold office 'during the pleasure of the Governor'. This 'pleasure clause' is pretty vague and has resulted in controversies. According to Dr Ambedkar, the Governor shall not withdraw his pleasure on the Council of Ministers, which enjoyed the confidence of the Legislative Assembly. However, in practices the Governors had dismissed the Council of Ministers without any reasons on the political reasons.

There were several occasions in which the Governors have chosen to act according to the direction of the Union Government and dismiss the State Council of Ministers. Until the S. R. Bommai case judgment this was practised widely although there were litigations. After the Bommai case rulings this practise has reduced, yet not eliminated. The dismissal of Arunchal Pradesh Government in 2016 is a recent example.

Another discretionary power of the Governor is relating to Article 356. According Article 356, the Governor's report is the basis for proclaiming the constitutional emergency. Many a time the report is got from the Governor only after the proclamation.<sup>[5]</sup>

The Sarkaria Commission on Centre–State relations recommended that the discretionary powers under Articles 163 and 164 and the powers under Article 356 must be sparingly used and must be resorted to only when unavoidable circumstances arise.

#### **Connect**

Which is NOT a 'discretionary power' of the Governor?

- 1. Seeking instructions from the President before promulgating ordinance.
- 2. Dissolution of State Assembly.
- 3. Advising the President for proclamation of an emergency.

#### *Issue 3: Media Exposure of Governor*

Next important issue relating to the office of Governor is that whether Governor can express his views in media. Governor is a symbolic office and is to exercise his powers on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. He is to act as the 'friend, philosopher and guide' to the Council of Ministers but without intruding into the powers of the Council of Ministers.

However, in the past this has not been so. In Karnataka in 2010, the then Governor openly commented to the press for the removal of two ministers who were accused of illegal mining. He also demanded the removal of the two ministers—G. Janardhana Reddy and G. Karunakara Reddy. Eyeing on the electoral funding the two brothers offered to the BJP, the party high command was soft on them. But the Governor openly demanding their removal was subjected to criticism. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution reiterated the recommendations of Sarkaria Commission that the Governor 'should be a person who has not taken too great a part in politics generally, and particularly in the recent past'.

**RA 80** 

<sup>5</sup> This is dealt with in detail in the Emergency Chapter.

#### Governor's Overreach? Or Exercise of Powers?

The Tamil Nadu Governor and the Lt Governor of Puducherry took certain measures which are considered to be Governor's overreach. But they claimed it to be well within their powers. The TN Governor visited various districts and conducted meeting with district officials. This triggered the controversy.

Many viewed that this was unconventional and unnecessary intervention of the Governor in administration.

Another view is that Governor, when he or she has any issue to take up with the State government, can get it done through the Council of Ministers.

Rejecting or overruling cabinet recommendations and complaining to Centre about the State or micromanaging is not part of the constitutional role of the Governor.

#### *Issue 4: Removal of Governor*

While the constitution has mentioned the ground on which the President can be removed and the procedure for his removal, it is not in the case of Governor. The Governor holds office during the pleasure of the President. These words in reality mean that the Governor will be in office as long as the union government extends its pleasure. The President may withdraw his pleasure on the Governor on any ground on the advice of the union Council of Ministers. Thus, there is no 'security of tenure or fixed term of office' for the office in effect. In the past whenever a new union government is formed after election to Lok Sabha, the Governors of the States and UTs being removed has become an established practice.

In Hargovind Pant versus Dr Raghukul Tilak case (1979), the Supreme Court held that 'Governor is an independent constitutional office which is not subjected to the control of Government of India'. Given the powers vested in the office and the functions the Governor is expected to perform, he is 'not an employee or a servant of the Centre in any sense of the term'.<sup>[6]</sup>

In 2010, in the B. P. Singhal case the Supreme Court ruled that the President's power to remove a Governor is subjected to judicial review. The Supreme Court ruled that Governor not being synchronous with the ideology of the union government or the Governor losing the confidence of the union government cannot be a ground for the removal. The change in the government cannot be ground for the removal. The court also ruled that there must be a cause existing for the removal of the Governor, although the President need not disclose the cause. The court has limited power to judicially review the decision to remove the Governor in case there was any arbitrariness or *mala fide* intention or political grounds or whimsically.

#### POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR

Article 154 reads that 'the executive power of the State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers' sub-ordinate to him in accordance with this constitution'. The terms 'executive power', 'exercised by him either directly or through officers' subordinate to him' have been explained elsewhere.<sup>[7]</sup> The powers of the Governor can be classified into:

- (a) Administrative powers
- (b) Legislative powers
- (c) Pardoning powers
- (d) Miscellaneous powers

The executive powers of the Governor will extend over the subjects on which the State legislature is empowered to make law. This means that the Governor will have powers on the subject matters in the State List and the Concurrent List of the Schedule 7. With respect to the concurrent list the power is limited by the executive power of the union government and the law made by the Parliament.

#### Bills Reserved for Consideration of President: Critical View

- It is subversive of the true federal principle.
- It is 'basically inconsistent with the supremacy of state legislature'
- • Power operates to subordinate the 'state legislature to the union executive'.
- Power is not being exercised in conformity with the purpose and object of these provisions. Governors reserve bills contrary to advice of Council of Ministers.
- Power being misused to serve the partisan interests of the Union Council of Ministers.
- • Since there is no time frame fixed for the President, it leads to delay of the enactment of laws.

### *Article 201: Bills Reserved for Consideration of President*

When a bill is reserved for the consideration is presented to the President, he may declare that he

- (a) Gives his assent, then the bill becomes a law or;
- (b) Withholds his assent, which means he vetoes the bill and the bill is dead or;
- (c) Direct the Governor to return a non-money bill for the reconsideration of the House with or without his recommendations. When the President directs so, the Governor returns the bill to the House. The House must reconsider the Bill and pass the bill again before six months from date on which it received by the House. It is the discretion of the House to accept the amendments recommended by the President. Once passed, the bill is again presented to the President for his assent. Unlike the Parliament bills, the President can reject the bill in the second instance also. That is the President can veto the Bill even after reconsideration by the House. Therefore, the State Legislatures do not have the power to override the veto of the President.

#### *Bills to be Reserved for Consideration*

The Governor can reserve a bill if:

- (a) In his opinion the bill may unduly encroaches the constitution.
- (b) The bill is not formulated with a national outlook and if becomes a law could affect the national interest adversely.
- (c) The bill is violating the directive principles.
- (d) The bill deals with the acquisitioning of property.

### Pardoning Powers

According to Article 161, the Governor has the powers to grant remission, respite, reprieve and pardon or commute the sentence with respect to any offence committed against a law enacted by the state legislature.

This power is subjected to Article 145. In case a convict has appealed to the Governor seeking and has also appealed to the Supreme Court against the orders of the high court, then the Governor shall not make any order on the petition if the Supreme Court had admitted the appeal. The Supreme Court has the powers to strike down the order made by the Governor in such cases.

According to Article 72 (3), the Governor has the power to suspend, commute or remit a death sentence. But he cannot grant pardon in case of death sentence. Only the President has the power to grant pardon in case of death sentence.

The pardoning powers of the Governor are amenable to judicial review. 'If the Governor is found to have exercised the power himself without being advised by the Government or if the Governor transgresses the jurisdiction in exercising the same or it is established that the Governor has passed the order without application of mind or the order in question is a *mala fide* one or the Governor has passed the order on some extraneous consideration.<sup>'(8)</sup>

# Discretionary Powers of the Governor

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Explain the discretionary powers of the Governor of a State. *IAS MAINS (2003)*

Unlike the President the Governor enjoys certain discretionary powers. The constitution expressly confers upon the Governor the discretionary powers. However, the Governor cannot exercise these powers according to his whims. The discretionary powers need to be exercised without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, in accordance with the constitution. Article 154 reads that 'the executive power of the State shall be vested in the Governor and shall be exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinated to him in accordance with this constitution'. Hence, it is not his personal discretion but the constitutional requirements which must be the basis for the exercise of his discretionary powers.

- (a) Article 163 confers discretionary powers on the Governor. If any question arises as to whether any power is discretionary power or not will also be determined by the Governor in his discretion.{11} The decision of the Governor in this regard is not subjected to judicial review and his decision is final.
- (b) Governor of a State can be appointed as the administrator of a union territory under Article 239(2). When so appointed the Governor will exercise his powers and discharge the duties relating to the union territory without the advice of the Council of Ministers.

#### Does Governor have Discretionary Powers under Schedule 5?

This is an interesting point.

2010: Attorney General gave the opinion that the Governor had discretionary powers under Schedule 5.

2015: Government reversed the stand that it was not a discretionary power.

(c) Under Article 356, the Governor needs to make periodical report to the President, on the affairs of the administration of the State. This report is one of the bases on which the President proclaims constitutional emergency over a State. $[12]$

<sup>10</sup> Para 2: Schedule 6-Constitution of India.

<sup>11</sup> Article 163 (2).

<sup>12</sup> Refer Chapter on Emergency for details.

- (d) Under Article 371 (2), the Governor of Maharashtra, has to discharge certain responsibilities under the direction of the President and not on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Governor has the special responsibility for:
  - The establishment of separate development boards for Vidarbha and Marathwada.
  - Equitable allocation of funds for developmental expenditure.
  - Equitable arrangement providing adequate facilities for technical education and vocational training.
  - Adequate opportunities for employment in services under the State government for those areas.

### CHIEF MINISTER AND COUNCIL OF MINISTERS

Article 163, provides for the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as its head. The Council of Ministers comprises the Chief Minister and other ministers.

The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor. The legislature party leader of the party which has the majority support of the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister. In case no political party enjoys the majority support then the Governor may apply his discretion. In such circumstances the Governor follows the convention as in the union.

The Governor would invite the leader of the single largest party in the Legislative Assembly to form the government. When he fails to form the government, Governor may call the leader of the alliance of parties formed before the election. In case the alliance also fails to make, only then he appoints the leader of the post-election alliance.

The Chief Minister enjoys the status of '*Primus inter pares'*, first among the equals with respect to his Council of Ministers. The Chief Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers (Article 163). It implies that the Council must always be headed by the Chief Minister.

According to article 164, other ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister and hold office during the pleasure of the Governor. The Governor has no discretion with respect to the appointment of the ministers. Hence, the Council of Ministers in effect hold office during the pleasure of the Chief Minister.

According to Article 164, in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, a minister in-charge of tribal welfare must be appointed. Such minister is also in-charge of the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and backward classes or any other work in addition to tribal welfare.

#### Second Arc View

- The size and composition of the Council of Ministers is of basic importance to effective public administration.
- The ministry and the cabinet come into existence for the specific purpose of running the administration efficiently and hence, it needs to be compact and homogenous, its size being determined by administrative needs.
- It would depend on factors such as the area of the State, its population, the stage of economic development and its peculiar problems.

After the Constitution (91st Amendment) Act, 2003, the total number of Ministers in the Council of Ministers, including the Chief Minister, shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly. Further, any person who has been disqualified to be a Member of State Legislature on the ground of defection must not be appointed as a minister.

### Issue of Constitutional Validity of Parliamentary Secretary

Parliamentary secretary is one of the members of the Council of Ministers when there was a five-tier system. After the Gopalswami Ayyangar Committee recommendations five-tier system was abolished and the three-tier system came in to practice. As a consequence, in the union there are only threetiers of ministers namely, member of cabinet, Minister of State and deputy ministers. The practice of appointing the parliamentary secretary was discontinued. However, the States continued to appoint the parliamentary secretary even after this, in order to accommodate 'politically important persons'.

This practice has been challenged in the court on several occasions. After the 91st amendment there is a ceiling fixed on the strength of the Council of Ministers of States and union. The appointment of parliamentary secretaries violates this limit. This is because the parliamentary secretaries enjoy the status of a member of Council of Ministers and are vested with powers equivalent to ministers.

In the recent times, the appointment of parliamentary secretaries in Delhi has triggered a fresh debate on this issue. The President rejected the proposed legislation by the Delhi government to remove the office of parliamentary secretary being considered as an 'office-of-profit'. The President rejected the bill as it was not introduced in the legislature in accordance with the procedure prescribed for the UTs. Accordingly, the bill must have been recommended by the Lt Governor after the approval of the Union Ministry of Home.

The Law Ministry presumes that the parliamentary secretaries are ministers based on the previous five-tier system. Hence, the question of 'office-of-profit' need not have been applied. But the Delhi Government's attempt to exempt it from the purview of office-of-profit triggered the debate.

When one looks the issue neutrally, the appointment of parliamentary secretaries is not acceptable on the following grounds:

It is a discontinued practice, which is being followed by the States only with political motive. It is to accommodate the 'political vested interest'. In that regard it can be considered unconstitutional.

Secondly, it is clearly violating Article 239AA of the constitution which fixes the limit on the size of the Council of Ministers of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Since the parliamentary secretaries are considered as ministers and enjoy the status and powers of ministers and are entitled to the remuneration equal to ministers, it is a violation of Article 239AA. Hence, the appointment is unconstitutional even if it is not to be an 'office-of-profit'.
