# INTRODUCTION

The concept of directive principles has been borrowed from the Irish Constitution. Part IV of the constitution deals with DPSP. Articles 36 to 51 contain 20 DPSPs. The concept of directive principles is a balance between the Marxian approach to achieve egalitarian society and democracy. These principles are to act as a guiding force of the policy-making in a modern democratic State. According to Dr Ambedkar, the DPSPs are like an instrument of instruction to the State.

## SCOPE OF DPSP

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What is the importance of Directive Principles of State Policy? Mention which Directive Principles of State Policy have primacy over the fundamental rights? *IAS MAINS 1999*

According to the Supreme Court, the directive principles have a positive aspect and they supplement fundamental rights in achieving a welfare state. Whenever it is needed, the fundamental rights can be amended for implementing the DPSPs, without affecting the basic features of the constitution. If needed, the fundamental rights should be adjusted to implement DPSP. So, the Supreme Court held that any law made for implementing DPSPs should be upheld as far as possible.

'The constitutional provisions, excepting the fundamental rights, may be construed in the light of directive principles'.[1] Even the subject matters, as given in Schedule 7, on which the Parliament and State legislature are empowered to legislate, must be given a wide interpretation in order to give effect to directive principles.

Though the object of directive principles is to embody the concept of a welfare state, the DPSP do not confer any enforceable rights.<sup>[2]</sup> Any alleged breach of DPSP by a law does not invalidates the law. The citizen cannot complain of any violation of DPSP and seek mandatory relief against the State for that. Similarly, DPSP will not be a source of power to the legislature for making law. The legislature must enact law to implement the DPSP based on the powers conferred and the subjects entrusted on them by the constitution.

The DPSPs aim to establish a 'social' and 'economic' democracy by striking a balance between the individual interest and the collective interest of the society. DPSPs act as a tool for social control and welfare measures enabling the organization of a 'socialistic pattern' of society.

# NEED, RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF DPSP[3]

While DPSPs serve the objective of reorganizing the society on socialistic lines, there have been several criticisms placed against them. The critics question the relevance of the directives on various grounds. Even, in the constituent assembly debates, some of the members were against including DPSP in the Indian constitution. The critical views on DPSPs are as follows:

- (a) Prescribing certain ideals for policy-making to the legislature and executive is illogical because the social values change with changing times.
- (b) In any democracy, the governments are run, based on the political ideology of the party voted to power. The political ideology might vary according to the changing socio-political conditions. So, to draw and prescribe certain fixed guidelines will be inappropriate.
- (c) Some of the DPSPs are categorized as 'rights', but it is misnomer. They cannot be called as rights because they are not enforceable by any court. Any right that the citizen cannot get relief for its infringement sounds meaningless.
- (d) Another criticism placed against DPSPs is that they are 'vague in expression' and are 'illogically arranged'. For instance, Article 41 reads that, 'the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance'. The expression 'within the limits of its economic capacity and development' is vague and gives the State a leverage to justify its non-performance or underperformance.

- (e) According to Ivor Jennings, the DPSPs are 'a break on the wheels of the national progresses'. The policy-makers tend to align their thought with the DPSP and will be bothered about policies conforming to the DPSP than their utility. Thus, DPSPs impede the progress of the nation.
- (f) T. T. Krishnamachari one of the constituent assembly members, criticized DPSPs 'a veritable dustbin of sentiments'. DPSPs sentimentally reflect the ideals and thoughts of Gandhi, Nehru and other values that guided the freedom struggle. It is paramount to respect and follow the teachings of the leaders but to incorporate them in the constitution is not essential. For instance, Article 47 entrusts responsibility for preventing the citizens consuming intoxicating drinks and drugs. Though it may be a requirement of a welfare state, it need not be included in the constitution.
- (g) Yet another criticism is that most of the DPSPs are borrowed from foreign nations or adapted from the political philosophy of Western societies.

#### Why DPSP?

n n n

- Ideals needed to establish a welfare state.
- Representing sentiments and values of the freedom struggle.
- A reminder to the state and the people of the rights to be guaranteed.
- Promoting social and economic democracy.
- A tool of political socialization.

In spite of the above criticisms, the DPSPs still hold relevance and are valid on account of the following reasons:

- 1. Certain ideals need to be mentioned in the constitution in order to enable an infant democracy like India to define 'welfare' and establish a welfare state.
- 2. India, at the time of independence suffered partition and inherited a shattered economy from the imperial British rule. In that context, it became essential for the founding fathers to prescribe those ideals.
- 3. It is an injustice to consider the DPSPs as a mere expression of sentiments of leaders. Even if they are so, it is appropriate to include them in the constitution, as these sentiments and values were the defining features of the freedom struggle. Justice Kania, the first Chief Justice of India, rightly noted that the DPSP assists courts and the policy-makers to interpret the constitution and understand the true spirit of the constitution and its goals.
- 4. To call DPSPs to be vaguely worded is not correct. Indeed, the DPSP is deliberately loosely worded to enable the policy-makers to have enough room to interpret the constitutional provisions for making policies towards the achievement of the welfare of the people.
- 5. DPSPs conferring unenforceable rights on the citizens were not an accident, but the founding fathers after considerable length of deliberations chose to provide them as unenforceable. The Sapru Committee<sup> $(4)$ </sup> (1946) recommended that the fundamental rights in the free Indian constitution must be of two classes namely justiciable and non-justiciable. Further, at the time of independence, India did not have enough resources to grant all the rights as enforceable.
- 6. DPSP serve as a reminder to the State of its responsibilities and to the people as a list of what is due to them.
- 7. Also, there is need for the society to achieve a level of maturity to enjoy certain rights and liberties. The social control on the individual liberties is much required so that an appropriate social climate is created.

<sup>4</sup> It was the committee that made constitutional proposals in 1946.

- 8. It is wrong to conclude that DPSPs are adaptations from foreign nations. Most of these directives are native and have been the very foundation of freedom struggle. For example, organizing village *panchayats* has been a traditional value and a system practised in India since ancient times. Similarly, protection of the interest of the SC and ST was an ideal that was at the roots of freedom struggle.
- 9. Last but not the least, DPSP serve another important purpose of being a tool of political socialization. Article 37 declares that DPSP are not enforceable by a court but they are enforceable politically. They serve as a benchmark to analyse the performance of the party that run the government when they go to the people for their electoral mandate. Similarly, it also enables the voter to compare the electoral manifesto of various political parties and make an informed decision to cast his vote in the election.

Hence, the DPSP are very much valid and relevant. Indeed, DPSP are more relevant in the present, the era of liberalization and rollback of State. As Granville Austin commented they serve as the 'conscience of the constitution'.

#### DPSP: NON-JUSTICIABLE REASON

Article 37 declares that the DPSPs are not enforceable by any court including the Supreme Court. However, it is 'fundamental to governance of the country'. The State is duty bound to apply in making law and policies. As a consequence, for the violation of the DPSP there will not be any judicial remedy. It is a deliberate decision of the constituent assembly to keep DPSP non-justiciable. However, they are not totally unenforceable, but are enforceable by other means.

#### Do You Know?

Article 37 clearly distinguishes between government, politics and good governance.

The DPSPs are in that nature of a 'basic standard of national conscience' as rightly stated by Prof. M. V. Pylee. The constitution establishes a democratic and responsible government. The government is elected by universal adult franchise and the government is accountable to the people. The DPSPs act as the touchstone for the elector to assess the performance the government that they have voted to power. Similarly, they also help assess the manifesto of the political parties contesting the elections when they approach the voters at the time of election.

Also, the DPSPs are enforceable by the executive. Article 355, provides that the union government is responsible for protecting the States from external aggression, internal disturbance and ensure that the administration of the State in accordance with the constitution. The union government thus, has the power to direct the States to implement the DPSPs. Hence, one cannot jump to the conclusion that the DPSPs are unenforceable and are an unwanted appendix to the constitution.

# DPSPS CLASSIFICATION

The DPSPs are grouped as:

- (i) Certain ideals for the State
- (ii) Certain guidelines and directions for policy-making
- (iii) Certain rights which are enforceable

Further, the DPSP can be classified as those representing:

(i) Socialistic values

- (ii) Gandhian values
- (iii) Liberalistic values

# Directives Representing Socialistic Values

The provisions of DPSP that represent socialistic values are Articles 38, 39, 39A, 41, 42, 43, 43A, 43B, 45 and 47. Of these, Article 38 sets the objective of securing a social order based on justice and Article 39 contains the principles to be followed by the State in establishing the social order. The other provisions seek to establish a charter for social security in the social order based on justice.

### *Article 38: Social Order*

The 44th amendment renumbered Article 38 as Article 38 (1) and inserted the Clause 2 to the article. Article 38 (1) is almost a verbatim reproduction of the preamble. It makes it an obligation to the State to establish a social order based on justice—social, economic and political. Clause 2 sets the objective of minimizing inequalities in income and eliminating the 'inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities' between individuals and groups.

The Supreme Court ruled that Article 38, reaffirms the concept of social justice. According to the Supreme Court, 'social justice' is an integral part of justice which is a dynamic process of mitigating the sufferings of the poor, weak, dalits, tribes and other deprived sections of the society. It is the 'process to elevate them to a level of equality to lead a life with dignity of life'.[5] The law is the catalyst that enables the weak to 'reach the ladder of social justice' and lead life of dignity.

Clause 2 of the article, inserted by the 44th amendment, has attempted to define objectively the features of such social order. Eliminating the inequalities in the status, facilities and opportunities is an essential objective of the State. In India, traditionally the social status of a person had been a factor that determined the facilities and opportunity to which any person was entitled. Further, these factors determined the inequality in income. Therefore, eliminating inequalities in status, facility and opportunity becomes essential to guarantee 'equality', which is declared by the Preamble as the resolve of the people of India, to all citizens.[6]

In establishing the social order, the State shall adopt the principle prescribed by Article 39. The principles in Article 39 may grouped as those establishing equality, embodying distributive justice and promoting welfare.

#### Supreme Court Observations on DPSP

- The object of Directive Principles is to embody the concept of a welfare state.
- Directive principles and fundamental rights are to be harmoniously construed.
- Parliament can amend fundamental rights for implementing the directives, so long as the amendment does not touch the basic features.
- • Legislation enacted to implement the directive principles should be upheld, as far as possible.

88 A

#### *Principles Establishing Equality*

Articles 39 (a) and (d) seek to establish the equality between men and women. Article 39 (a) prescribes equality of men and women 'to adequate means of livelihood'. Clause (d) prescribes equal pay for equal work both men and women. 'Social justice and equality are complementary to each other so that both should maintain their vitality. Rule of law is a potent instrument of social justice to bring about equality.<sup> $(7)$ </sup>

The Supreme Court has held that the article aims at securing a welfare state and helps interpreting and understanding provisions relating to fundamentals rights. For instance, when 'equal pay for equal work' is denied to men and women, it becomes irrational classification and is in violation of the principle of equality guaranteed by Article 14. Any difference in pay must be based on the differences in the duties.

#### *Doctrine of Distributive Justice*

Articles 39 (b) and (c) embody the Doctrine of Distributive Justice. The doctrine refers to the removal of inequalities rectifying the injustice and resettling them in the dealings and transactions between the unequal.[8] Article 39 (b) provides that the ownership and control of material resources of the community must be distributed for the community good. Article 39 (c) makes 'prevention of concentration of wealth' an obligation on the State.

The two provisions embody the socialistic objective of the constitution. It therefore becomes an obligation to ensure equitable distribution of resources by 'suitable legislations', taxation, etc. The term 'material resources' in Article 39 (c) includes even the land owned by private parties. Hence, the provision justifies the land ceiling laws. To enable the achievement of this objective, Article 31C was inserted by the 25th amendment. Article 31C provides saves a law, enacted to give effect to Articles 39 (b) and (c), from being declared invalid even if the law is inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by article 14, 19 and 31. Read along with the Article 38 (2), Articles 39 (b) and (c) embodying the principle of distributive justice have dealt a blow to the fundamental right to property which was repealed by the 44th amendment.

Furthermore, these provisions also empower the State to nationalize any sector of economy and promote 'collectivism'. Though the constitution does not envisage collectivism in the garb of socialism, whenever it becomes necessary the State can assume the role for serving the public cause. However, this needs to be undertaken with utmost care because the constitution does not envisage establishing a socialist State but only a 'socialistic pattern of society'. Pandit Nehru clearly distinguished the 'socialism' and 'socialistic pattern of society'. While explaining the objective of planning in India he said, 'Socialism to some people means two things: Distribution which means cutting off the pockets of the people who have too much money and nationalization. Both these are desirable objectives, but neither is by itself socialism.

Any attempt to distribute by affecting the productive machinery is utterly wrong; to do so would be to weaken ourselves. The basis of socialism is greater wealth; there cannot be any socialism of poverty. Therefore, the process of equalization has to be phased.

Secondly, to the question of nationalization Pandit Nehru said 'I think it is dangerous merely to nationalize something without being prepared to work it properly. To nationalize we have to select things. My idea of socialism is that every individual in the State should have equal opportunity for progress.'

#### *Principles Promoting Welfare*

Articles 39 (e) and (f), makes it an obligation for the State to endeavour to promote the health and strength of workers, men and women, the tender age of children. Protect them from being subjected to exploitation and to enable them lead a life of dignity. The social order must be so organized that the any citizen must not be forced to take up 'any vocation unsuited to their age or strength' due to economic necessity.

<sup>7</sup> Supreme Court: Air India Statutory Corporation versus United Labour Union, November 1996.

<sup>8</sup> Supreme Court: VGP Prem Nagar Minvariya Kudi versus the state of Tamil Nadu 2008.

It also mentions that 'children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a health manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment'. This needs to be read along with the fundamental right against exploitation guaranteed by Articles 23 and 24. Hence, it is a constitutional obligation of the State to ensure that the children are provided with good parental care, education. The State has to make law to eliminate child labour, etc. This is a prerequisite for India and becomes all the more important in the present context to derive the benefits of 'demographic dividend'.

# *Charter for Social Security*

The provisions of the Articles 41, 42, 43, 43A, 45, 46, 47 and 39A provides a list of rights that is fundamental in a socialistic pattern of society.

1. **Article 41: Right to work, to education and to public assistance**

Article 41 provides that, the State 'within its economic capacity and development', has to guarantee the:

- Right to education
- Work
- Public assistance in certain cases of unemployment, old age sickness and certain cases of undeserved want

It means that the State to formulate the policies to develop the economy so that it has the capacity to guarantee the said rights. The framers of the constitution had so provided considering the large size of the country, its population and the level of poverty. However, in the context of liberalization this stand is not fully acceptable because the State has much wider opportunity to mobilize resources both from within and without the country.

**'Freebies' – Corrupt Practice or Addressing 'Undeserved Want'<sup>(9)</sup>: Political parties promise** to distribute freebies in their election manifesto. When the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) promised to distribute television sets if the party was voted to power in 2006 election, it was challenged in the Madras High Court. Such promises are made to induce the voters. This affects the level playing field between the candidates, which in turn disrupts free and fair election. Although such 'freebies' are in form of an election manifesto they in reality are a bribe or inducement. Hence, they are unconstitutional in accordance with the provisions of Representation of People Act.

Later in the case on appeal the Supreme Court ruled that the promises in the election manifesto cannot be read into Section 123 for declaring it to be a corrupt practice. It was argued that the schemes challenged fall within the realm of fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy that they are to fulfil the undeserved want of the people. It was argued that distribution of free TVs was for the purpose of providing recreation and general knowledge to the household women, more particularly, those living in the rural areas.

The Directives Principles of State Policy in Part IV of the Constitution mandates the incumbent State government to promote the welfare of the people, who are below the poverty line or unable to come up without their support. Article 41 mandates the State to provide assistance to people in cases of undeserved wants.

The objective of the State in the era of good governance is to create a self-reliant society. To usher in to a self-reliant society it is essential to:

- Discovering the natural abilities and skills of the citizen
- Tapping the potential by educating
- Training them to use the potential appropriately
- Appropriate marketing of their potential Integrating their contribution with GDP

**RA 80** 

<sup>9</sup> S. Subramaniam Balaji versus Government of Tamil Nadu, July, 2013.

But the freebies do not achieve the objective of the good governance because they do not establish a self-reliant society. On the contrary, the freebies make the citizens more dependent on the State. This gives more scope for the State to interfere in the private life of the citizens which in turn may infringe upon the fundamental rights of the citizens.

#### 2. **Article 42: Provision for just and humane conditions of work**

The State must make policies and law to ensure that working conditions, in organizations both public and private, are 'just and humane'. It is an obligation to provide maternity relief to worker.

#### Sexual harassment of women at workplace: Supreme Court Guidelines<sup>[10]</sup>

- 1. It shall be the duty of the employer to prevent sexual harassment by taking all steps required.
- 2. Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour, whether directly or by implication as:
  - Physical contact and advances
  - A demand or request for sexual favours
  - Sexually-coloured remarks
  - Showing pornography
  - Any other unwelcome physical verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.
- 3. All employers should take appropriate steps to prevent sexual harassment and they should take the following steps:
  - (a) The definition of sexual harassment should be notified, circulated and published at the workplace.
  - (b) The rules/regulations relating to conduct and discipline should include rules/regulations prohibiting sexual harassment.
  - (c) Appropriate penalties in such rules against the offender must be prescribed.
  - (d) Appropriate work conditions should be provided in respect of work, leisure, health and hygiene.
  - (e) The working conditions must ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at workplaces.
- 4. An appropriate complaint mechanism should be created in the organization for redress of the complaint made by the victim. Such complaint mechanism should ensure time-bound treatment of complaints.
- 5. A Complaints Committee must be provided in the organization. The Complaints Committee should be headed by a woman and not less than half of its member should be women.
- 6. The Complaints Committee should involve a third party, either NGO or other body who is familiar with the issue of sexual harassment.
- 7. The Complaints Committee must make an annual report and action taken by them to the government.

**Sexual harassment of women at workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:** Subsequently the law to prevent and protect women from sexual harassment was enacted. 'The law focuses on prevention of sexual harassment at workplace and provides a redressal mechanism. The act has been highlighted over the last year due to the efforts of the government to ensure its enforcement'.

The act upholds women's fundamental rights to equality, right to live with dignity and right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe working environment, free from sexual harassment as provided under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Indian Constitution. $(11)$

### **Constitutional Safeguards for Women**

- (a) Article 14: Right to equality
- (b) Article 15(3): Power of the make special provisions for the development of women and children
- (c) Article 23: Protection against trafficking and forced labour
- (d) Article 29: Protection in respect of admission to educational institutions

- (f) Article 39 (d): Right to equal pay for equal work
- (g) Article 42: Human conditions of work
- (h) Articles 243 D and 243T: Reservation of seats in *panchayats* and municipalities

### 3. **Article 43: 'Living Wage'**

Article 43 is a very liberal and openly worded. It states that the State shall 'by suitable legislation or economic organization or in any other way' provide 'living wage'. It states that the State has to provide for all workers, work, conditions of work and 'Living Wage'.

- (a) The 'Living Wage' must be adequate to ensure:Decent standard of life
- (b) Full enjoyment of leisure
- (c) Full enjoyment of social opportunities
- (d) Full enjoyment of cultural opportunities

| <b>Living Wage and Right to Life</b>                             |                                                  |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--|
| l Article 43                                                     | <b>Article 21</b>                                |  |
| Decent standard of life.                                         | Right to live with human dignity.                |  |
| Full enjoyment of leisure, social and cultural<br>opportunities. | Life including the 'finer graces' of human life. |  |

**'Living Wage':** The founding fathers have consciously chosen to use the term 'living wage'. The concept of living wage takes into account the uncertainties caused due to inflation and other incidental factors like the differences between the cities. The term 'minimum wages' is avoided because it gives leverage to the government because 'minimum' refers to a fixed amount and might become inadequate when the circumstances change. But living wage will mean a minimum that must be adequate irrespective of the economic changes and the differences between the places of residence.

Further, living wage must be adequate to enjoy leisure, social and cultural opportunities. This needs to be read along with Article 21, the right to life. Decent standard of living, fullest enjoyment of leisure, social and cultural opportunities is an aspect of dignified life.

#### 4. **Article 43A: Participative Management**

It was inserted by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. It sets an obligation on the State to enact legislations for participative management of organizations or industry.

### 5. **Article 45: Childhood Care**

Article 45 provides for the early childhood care as an obligation of the State. It provides education for all children until they complete the age of six years. The 86th amendment inserted Article 21A. It made the free education for children from the age of 6 to 14 years has been made a fundamental right.

### **Right to Education Act<sup>(12):</sup>**

The Constitution (86th Amendment) Act, 2002, inserted Article 21 A. It provides for free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of 6 to14 years as a fundamental right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine.

### 6. **Article 46: Educational and Economic interests of SCs, STs and other weaker sections**

It is the constitutional duty of the State to promote the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections especially that of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. They must be protected from 'social injustice and all forms of exploitation'.

### 7. **Article 47: Providing Health and Nutrition**

The State is duty-bound to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health of the citizens. In particular, it is the duty of the State to prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs. This does not mean that the State can indulge in moral policing and interfere in the rights of the citizens. It means the State needs to build the moral values and educate the people of the ill-effects of the consumption. Towards this, the State has made it mandatory to print on the statutory warning.

### **National Food Security Act<sup>[13]</sup>**

**Coverage and Entitlement under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS):** Upto 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population will be covered under TPDS, with uniform entitlement of 5 kg per person per month. However, since Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households constitute poorest of the poor, and are presently entitled to 35 kg per household per month, entitlement of existing AAY households will be protected at 35 kg per household per month.

**State-wise coverage:** Corresponding to the all India coverage of 75% and 50% in the rural and urban areas, state-wise coverage will be determined by the Central government. Planning Commission has determined the state-wise coverage by using the NSS Household Consumption Survey data for 2011–12.

**Subsidized prices under TPDS and their revision:** Foodgrains under TPDS will be made available at subsidized prices of  $\bar{\tau}$  3/2/1 per kg for rice, wheat and coarse grains for a period of three years from the date of commencement of the Act.

### 8. **Article 39A: Equal justice and Free Legal aid**

Article 39A was inserted by 42nd constitutional amendment. It provides for equal justice and free legal aid. In case where any citizen is not able to get legal assistance due to his economic or other disabilities, then the State shall provide free legal aid by suitable legislations or schemes.

According to the Supreme Court, Article 39A has to be read along with Article 21. With Article 21, it reinforces the right of a person to speedy trial and free legal aid. It is part of right to live with human dignity.

It means that the State has to secure the operation of the legal system that promotes justice. Consequently, the State is empowered to enact legislations towards or formulate schemes for this purpose. In the process, the State is empowered to mobilize the required resources for operating such schemes. The State also has the powers to involve the non-governmental organizations in case the State suffers from inadequacy of resources.

According to the Court, the State is also empowered to establish and run law colleges including private colleges. The State also has the powers to regulate and control such institutions.

**National Legal Services Authority (NALSA):** The Legal Services Authorities Act, was enacted in 1987. It came into force in 1995. NALSA seeks to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society. The principal objective of NALSA is to provide free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society. It is to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities, as mandated by Article 39A. NALSA organizes Lok Adalat for amicable settlement of disputes. Other functions of NALSA include spreading legal literacy and awareness, undertaking social justice litigations, etc.

# Directives Representing Gandhian Values

The following are the DPSPs that represent the Gandhian values. The provisions of Articles 40, 43, 47 and 48 represent Gandhian values.

### 1. **Organization of** *Panchayats*

Article 40 imposes the obligation on the State, 'to organize village *panchayats* and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of selfgovernment'. It is a measure to promote the grass roots democracy. The constitution aims at a developmental role for *panchayats*. The *panchayats* act as tools of training for development of the democratic institutions.

Towards achieving this objective, the Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992, has been passed. The amendment has added Schedule 11 which contains the functions to be devolved to the *panchayats*.

### DPSP Implementation

Article 40: Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992. Article 43: Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP). Article 47: Statutory warning on the tobacco products. Article 48: Ban on cow Slaughter by certain states.

### 2. **Promotion of Cottage Industry**

Article 43 makes it an obligation on the State to promote cottage industries on an individual or co-operative basis in rural areas. Although, development of cottage industry is largely the responsibility of State governments, the union government has taken several measures for the promotion of cottage industries. The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) has a number of schemes/interventions for the development of MSME including cottage industry on the basis of labour-intensive techniques and low per capita investment.

For example, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises is implementing Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), a credit-linked subsidy programme since 2008–09 with Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) as nodal agency at the national level for generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro enterprises including cottage industries by organizing traditional artisans and unemployed youth, helping in preventing their migration besides increasing their earning capacity throughout the country.<sup>[14]</sup>

### 3. **Raising level of nutrition and prohibition consumption of intoxicating drinks**

The State is duty-bound to raise the level of nutrition and public health (Article 47). As part of maintaining the public health it is essential to prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs. It means the State needs to build the moral values and educate the people of the ill effects of the consumption. Towards this the State has made it mandatory to print on the statutory warning.

#### 4. **Prohibiting the slaughter of cows**

The State is entrusted with the responsibility of prohibiting the slaughter of cows and other mulching and draught cattle by Article 48. The slaughter of cows is banned by law in certain States in India. States such as Bihar, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh have enacted law to ban the slaughter of cows. In such States it is an offence punishable up to 10 years. However, the slaughter is permitted if it is essential for research, or if animal suffers from contagious disease.

## *Directives Representing Liberalistic Values*

The following provisions of DPSPs of Articles 44, 45, 48, 48A, 49, 50 and 51 represent the liberalistic values. Liberalistic values are those which seek to promote secular values that are liberal.

### 1. **Uniform Civil Code**

Article 44, makes it an obligation on the State to promote a uniform civil code to all citizens. Uniform civil code is a set of law proposal which will replace all the laws—personal laws governing institutions like marriage, divorce, inheritance of property, etc., based on religious faith.

**Need for a Uniform Civil Code:** The need for a uniform civil code is promoted on the following reasons mentioned below.Firstly, India being a secular republic needs to progressive and must have a common law for all citizens. To have different rules based on religion is against the principle of equality. In fact, the fundamental rights have sought to reform many religious practices that were found to against the progress of the nation.

Secondly, a uniform civil code helps to check the caste and religion-based politics. India has shown remarkable progress in the economic front but the social progress is hampered by the anachronistic religion-based traditions and personal laws. In the social-cultural respect, Indian society remains at a midpoint—neither a modern nor a traditional society.

Thirdly, the existence of the personal laws keeps the nation divided in many respects and retards the nation-building activity.

Fourthly, the promotion of gender justice demands a uniform civil code. Indian society is primarily a patriarchal society ridden by age-old traditions that promotes unfair unequal treatment of women. The constitution declares the resolve of the people to guarantee equal rights to women, which accelerates the need for a uniform civil code.

Fifthly, the existence of various personal laws has been a loophole which is effectively exploited by the dominant and elite social class. For instance, the alternate judicial systems in rural India and the practices like honour killings are supported by the absence of the uniform civil code.

Sixthly, vote bank politics can be reduced by a uniform civil code. When all religions are brought under a single set of laws, the opportunity to offer benefits to certain religious denominations, especially the minorities, for garnering their vote will be reduced.

On the above grounds, there have been demands to make uniform civil code and implement in the past. At present, Goa is the only State in India to have a common civil code, also known as the Goa Family Law. The demand had always resulted in heated arguments for and against having the code. This had been a most debated provision even in the constituent assembly. However, the founding fathers have deliberately provided it as an unenforceable directive.

**Uniform Civil Code: Why an Unenforceable Directive?:** Uniform civil code aims at securing 'harmony through uniformity' is an undeniable truth. But making it a compulsory provision would result in a sort of regimentation of the civil code which will result in 'discontent or dissatisfaction'.

Similarly, the Supreme Court has also ruled that although uniform civil code for all persons may be desirable, its enactment in one go may be counterproductive to the unity and integrity of the nation. Progressive changes must be brought gradually because social change is a slow process. The legislature must make or amend the existing law where there is an acute necessity. To make all laws to be uniformly applicable to all people in one go would be inexpedient and incorrect.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Discuss the possible factors that inhibit India from enacting for its citizens a uniform civil code as provided for in the Directive Principles of State Policy *IAS MAINS (2015)* 

**RA 80** 

India being a pluralist society, people have different faiths and the tenets propounded by their religious faiths are multifarious. It is indeed a challenge to achieve unity among the people professing different religious faiths, born in different castes, creeds or sub-sections in the society, speaking different languages and dialects in different regions and provided a secular constitution. 'The directive principles of the constitution themselves visualize diversity and attempt to foster uniformity among people of different faiths. $(15)$ 

The orthodox section among the minorities such as Muslims feels that the Uniform civil code will adversely affect their identity. The issue has been sensationalized by the media which brought the debate from the need for uniform civil code to the divinity of personal law. Consequently, the demand for UCC is regarded as identity politics and viewed negatively.

Another major problem is that the prevailing religious laws in India differ with community, caste and region.

### 2. **Organization of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry**

Article 48, makes it an obligation to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on scientific lines. It is also required of the State to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds of cattle.

#### 3. **Protection and improvement of environment, safeguarding forest and wildlife**

Article 48A, mandates that it is the duty of the State to 'to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country'. It was inserted by the 42nd amendment in 1976.

### 4. **Protection of monuments and places and objects of national importance**

It shall be the obligation of the State to protect every monument or place or object of artistic or historic interest, declared by or under law made by Parliament to be of national importance, from spoliation, disfigurement, destruction, removal, disposal or export.<sup>[16]</sup>

### 5. **Separation of judiciary from executive**

Article 50 provides that the executive powers and judicial powers must be separated and not to be vested in the same authority. When the two powers are conferred on the same office, it will result in a conflict of interest.

### 6. **Promotion of international peace and security**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Value premises of the Indian constitution in the context of global constitutionalism. Comment. *IAS Mains Public Administration Paper II (2002)* 

Article 51 lays down that the, 'State shall endeavour to:

- (a) Promote international peace and security.
- (b) Maintain just and honourable relations between nations.
- (c) Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another.
- (d) Encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration.'

This is one of the most progressive provisions of the constitution. The constitution sets the value premises that are far ahead in the present context. When the world today is attempting to establish a universal system to promote a peaceful and harmonious international political order, the constitution prescribes it as a positive obligation to India.

# CONFLICT BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

- (a) What is the constitutional position of DPSP? How it has been interpreted by the judiciary after the emergency in 1975–77? *IAS MAINS (2001)*
- (b) Briefly state the stages through which the present position of the directive principles vis-a-vis the fundamental rights have emerged. *IAS MAINS (1998)*

The constitution very much accepts that under certain circumstances the implementation of the DPSPs may conflict with the fundamental rights. Article 31C was inserted by the 24th Amendment, 1971 is the evidence of such recognition. The DPSPs representing the collective liberties of the society need to be given primacy over the fundamental rights in certain cases. The Supreme Court has also ruled that the DPSPs will act as 'reasonable restrictions' on the fundamental rights. Accordingly, Article 31C provides for the supremacy of the directives in Articles 39 (b) and (c) over the fundamental rights. However, this should not be construed that there is an inherent conflict between the two.

The fundamental rights always enjoy primacy and any step taken by the State to promote the welfare of the people must be consistent with the right guaranteed by Part III. The DPSPs play an important role in the guaranteeing the fundamental rights. Many of the DPSPs represent the conditions that are essential for the fullest enjoyment of the fundamental rights. Some of them are fundamental rights that need to be guaranteed when the State has adequate resources by achieving the required economic growth.

The Constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, sought to break is integration between fundamental rights and DPSP by expanding the scope of Article 31C. The amendment immunized any law seeking to give effect to any of the directives in Part IV from being declared invalid even if it infringed on the fundamental rights. However, the Supreme Court declared the amendment invalid in the Minerva Mills case (1980).

The court ruled that there is no inherent conflict between DPSP and fundamental rights. The Court quoted Granville Austin who said, 'the DPSP and the fundamental rights together constitute the conscience of the constitution'. The court evolved the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, which states that if there appears to be a conflict between two provisions of the constitution, then the meaning that provides for the harmonious operation of both shall be taken. Any other meaning that may present a conflict between the two shall be discarded.

## FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES

Fundamental duties given in Part IVA was not found in the original constitution. The concept was borrowed for former USSR. It entails that rights always goes with duties. Hence, they are complimentary to fundamental rights. It was added by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976. The amendment added Part IVA and Article 51A.

According to the fundamental duties provided in Article 51A, it shall be the duty of every citizen of India:

- (a) To abide by the constitution and respect the National Flag and the National Anthem.
- (b) To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom.
- (c) To protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.
- (d) To defend the country.
- (e) To promote the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India
- (f) To preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.
- (g) To protect and improve the natural environment.
- (h) To develop the scientific temper and spirit of inquiry.
- (i) To safeguard public property.
- (j) To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity.
- (k) Who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years.<sup>[17]</sup>

## Enforceability of Fundamental Duties

The fundamental duties are not enforceable by any court. They are prescribed as a binding value to the citizens. The citizens must undertake to abide by the fundamental duties and perform the duties as a responsibility to enjoy their fundamental rights.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the 'fundamental duties cannot be enforced by writs. They can be promoted only by constitutional methods. But they can be used for interpreting ambiguous statutes'.

<sup>17</sup> Article 51A (k) was inserted by the Constitution (86th Amendment) Act, when the right to education was made a fundamental right by Article 21A.
