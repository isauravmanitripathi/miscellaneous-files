# RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF RELIGION (ARTICLES 25–28)

The right to freedom of religion is an important aspect of a modern democracy. The right to freedom of speech and the forming associations or unions include the freedom of religious speech and form religious associations. In order to instil confidence in the religious minorities, the founding fathers of the constitution have provided for the freedom of religion in Articles 25 to 28. The freedom of religion is guaranteed by the declaration of the Preamble. The Preamble declares that the citizen of India is entitled to, 'Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship'.

### Article 25: Freedom of Conscience, Profess, Practice and Propagate Religion

Article 25 (1) guarantees every person has the right to freedom of conscience, profess, practise and propagate a religion of his choice. This freedom is guaranteed to all persons, both citizens and aliens equally within the territory of India. However, the freedom is not absolute. It is subjected to public order, morality, health and other fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III.

#### Supreme Court on Religion

- • Religion is a matter of faith but belief in God is not essential to constitute religion.
- Doctrines of each religion constitute its essential part, but the court is competent to examine them.
- Philosophy is different from religion.

#### Must I have a Religion in India?

No. Not needed. The Preamble guarantees the liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. This read along with the right to conscience means, man-God relation is absolutely individual choice. So, Indian constitution recognizes being a theist an atheist and an agnostic under the right to freedom of religion.

The right to conscience is, however, an absolute right. Conscience refers to the inner freedom of a person to mould his relation with God, human beings and other creatures in the manner he prefers. When read along with the Preamble, it is clear that the constitution leaves the man-God relationship to oneself. The state will not be bothered about whether any person is a believer in God or otherwise. At the same time, the state will not also reject the presence of the, 'unseen spirit or the relevance of a religion to life'. The state needs to be more concerned with the man-man relationship.

The right to conscience also includes the right not to believe and not to have a religious faith. Thus, it guarantees the right to be an atheist. It also guarantees the right to be agnostic.

Profess is to declare one's faith and belief freely and openly. Practice means to perform the religious rites and observe the duties associated with one's religion and to exhibit one's religious belief.

Propagate means the right to communicate a person's beliefs to another person or to expose the tenets of that faith. But it does not include the right to convert another person to the former's faith. But the freedom to propagate does not include the right to convert any person form one religion to another.

#### Why the term 'Secular' Not Included in the Original Constitution?

'There was no need to include the term 'secular' as the entire constitution embodied the concept of secular state, which meant non-discrimination on grounds of religion and equal rights and status to all citizens.'

*Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

The Supreme Court ruled that, 'Propagation is concerned with right to communicate beliefs to another person or to expound the tenets of one's religion, but does not include a right to forcible conver-

<sup>1</sup> Stanislaus versus State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1977 SC 908.

sions'.[1] When Madhya Pradesh enacted the law prohibiting conversion by 'force or allurement' Reverend Father Stanislaus challenged the law in the Supreme Court that the law was infringing upon the right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 25. The court refused to accept this argument and grant remedy to Reverend Father Stanislaus. The court ruled that the law prohibited the:

- Conversion from one religion to another and not from majority to minority religion.
- Conversion by force or allurement. The law does not prohibit voluntary conversion.

The right to profess, practice and propagate are subject to restrictions on the ground of public order, morality, health and other fundamental rights. Such restrictions are imposed only to ensure 'Man–man relationship' which is the basis for social harmony.

#### *Regulation and Restriction*

Article 25 (2) confers power upon the state to regulate and restrict the freedom of religion. According to Article 25 (2) (a), the state has the powers to regulate or restrict 'any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice'.

Those activities which are directly related to the practice of the religion or those that form the core activity of the religion are known as religious activities. Any other activity that is not related to the core of the religion is known as 'secular' activities. Of the many secular activities, Article 25 mentions three namely, economic, financial and political. These are activities not directly related to the core religion and hence, are secular activities. The state has the powers to regulate or restrict such activities by a law.

Article 25 (2) (b) empowers the state to regulate the religious activities to promote social reforms and 'throwing open the Hindu religious institutions for all classes of Hindus'. The Hindu religious institutions include the Buddhist, Jain and Sikh religious institutions also. This power is conferred on the state only to ensure that no social evil practice be justified and perpetuated in the garb of religion. In India there had been several social evil practices and superstitions that were associated with religion. For instance, even the practice of untouchability was justified on the religious values.

# Article 26: Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs

Subjected to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right:

- To establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purpose.
- To manage its own affairs in matters of religion.
- To own and acquire movable and immovable property.
- To administer such property in accordance with law.

#### Restrictions on Article 25 and 26

- They are subjected to public order morality and health.
- Human sacrifice, not included in the right.
- Offer prayers on a busy road, not included.
- State can regulate secular activities.
- State can regulate the administrative and other aspects of a temple/church/mosque.
- • Use of loudspeakers can be regulated and if needed prohibited in the public interest.
- Hereditary rights of priests abolished.
- Practising polygamy is prohibited by law. It is not part of the Hindu religion.

This right is also subject to the restrictions on the same grounds as Article 25, because the right guaranteed by Article 26 flows out of the right guaranteed by Article 25. Without the freedom of religion, the freedom to manage religious affairs is meaningless.

The right is guaranteed to all religious groups. Even after 44th amendment, the right to property is a fundamental right to the religious groups and denominations. Further this right is available to all religious groups irrespective of majority or minority religion.

However, this is not an absolute right. The property of a religious institution can be acquired:  $^{[2]}$ 

- (a) Under article 31A (1) (a), for effecting agrarian reform.
- (b) If it exceeds the ceiling allowed by the relevant legislation.

Further, the property owned by the religious groups is also subjected to any tax that is imposed commonly on all properties. Such a measure must not be regarded as an unreasonable restriction.[3] The rights given by Articles 25 and 26 are not absolute:

Firstly, they are subjected to public order morality and health. No person can claim the right to conduct human sacrifice, or to offer prayers on a busy highway.

Secondly, the constitution divides affairs of religious institutions into religious, secular and other activities. State can regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activities which may be associated with a religious practice.

Thus, right to observe and practice rituals is protected from state intervention. But the administrative and other aspects of a temple/church/mosque etc., can be regulated. For example, Waqf Board, *Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams*, etc.

Thirdly, the state may intervene to bring social reform and for throwing open of Hindu temples etc., of a public character to all sections of Hindus.

Places of religious worship like mosques, churches, temples, etc., can be acquired by the state. Such acquisition does not violate Articles 25 or 26. The right to worship does not extend to the right of worship at any or every place.

The following are some of the restrictions which have been held to be permissible:

- The state can impose restrictions on the use of loudspeakers for Azan or for singing *kirtans*, etc. Use of loudspeakers is not an essential and integral part of a religion.
- Abolition of hereditary rights of *archakas* (priests) is not interference with essential religious practice.
- Polygamy is not an essential part of the Hindu religion so it can be prohibited by law. This is for reform of the Hindus.
- The Jagannath Temple Act by which the government vested the secular activities in a committee is valid because it did not interfere with religious practices.

# Article 27: Freedom as to Payment of Taxes for Promotion of Any Particular Religion

If the state imposes a tax, the proceeds of which is to spent for the promotion of any particular religion, then every person has the right not to pay the tax. The state cannot compel any person to pay such a tax. The state being an irreligious state must not patronize any particular religion. It is against the principle of secularism.

# Article 28: Freedom Against Religious Instruction

It prohibits imparting any religious instructions in any of the educational institution established by the state or funded by the state wholly or partially. In case of other education institutions, the religious instructions may be imparted but no one can be compelled to receive those instructions.

Attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions must be on voluntary and no one should be compelled. In case of minors the attendance shall be only on the consent of the guardian or parents.

# Freedom of Religion and Secular State

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Give your views on the right to freedom of religion as enshrined in the Indian constitution. Do they make India a secular state? *IAS MAINS (2005)*

The basic principle of secular state is that the religion and state must be separated. 'The religious impartiality of the Indian state is not to be confused with atheism. Secularism is defined in accordance with the ancient religious traditions. It tries to build-up a fellowship of believers, not by subordinating individual qualities to the group mind but by bringing them to a harmony with each other'.<sup>[4]</sup>

The main features of the secular state envisaged by the constitution of India are:

- The state is an irreligious state and the state will not be controlled by any religion.
- The right includes the right to have a religious faith or be an atheist or agnostic.
- The state must not discriminate any person for embracing any religion or having any faith or not having one.
- The state must not declare any citizen disqualified for any public employment on the ground of religion. All citizens are equally entitled to the right.
- The state must separate religion and politics and establish conditions for securing fraternity of the citizens to assure dignity of individuals.

#### What State Must do to Make Secularism Work?

- Preventing any religious group from dominating other groups.
- Preventing any group within a particular religious group dominating others in the same religion.
- Must not give preference to or restrict a religion.

# CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS

Articles 29 and 30 guarantees certain cultural rights on the minorities. Article 29 seeks to protect the interest of minorities. The term 'minority' is not defined by the constitution or by any law. However, any section of the people who are a non-dominant group in any given locality is known as a minority.

A citizen of India who has a distinct language, script or culture of its own will have the right to conserve them [Article 29 (1)]. 'Although, commonly Article 29 (1) is assumed to relate to minorities, its scope is not necessarily so confined, as it is available to 'any section of citizens resident in the territory of India'.<sup>[5]</sup>

The Supreme Court also ruled that the right to agitate for the protection of their language is a consequence of the 'right to conserve' one's script. Also, the Court ruled that 'Political' speeches for the conservation of the language of a section of the citizens cannot, therefore, be regarded as a corrupt practice within the meaning of Section 123 (3) of the representation of the People Act, 1951.

In case of any educational institution maintained by the state or receiving aid out of state funds on grounds of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. Article 29 (2) and Article 15 (4) are to be read together. Accordingly, the state is empowered to take measures for the development of the backward classes.

<sup>4</sup> President Radhakrishnan, Recovery of Faith. Originally published in 1956.

<sup>5</sup> Supreme Court: St. Xavier's College Society versus State of Gujarat, AIR 1974 SC 1389.

Similarly, Article 15 confers a right against discrimination on everyone who denies the right. It is available to all in general. But the right guaranteed by Article 29 is specific with respect to minorities and only in case of admission to educational institutions. The grounds religion, race, caste is common to both Articles 15 and 29, whereas language is the ground given in Article 29.

# Article 30: Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions

Article 30 recognizes two types of minorities namely, linguistic and religious. The linguistic and religious minorities are conferred with the right to establish and administer the educational institutions. It also provides that the state should not discriminate the educational institutions while providing aid or assistance between one and the other minority.

Unlike Article 29, the right guaranteed by Article 30 (1) can be availed only by the minorities. The right of administering the institutions means to administer them without the external control. However, such autonomy is subjected to the state regulations for reasons such as the maintenance of standards for excellence, etc. However, such regulations are subjected to the following conditions:

- The regulations must be reasonable.
- It should regulate the educational character of the institution.
- It must be conducive in making the institution effective for those use it.
- It should not inhibit the rights under Article 30 (1).

#### Minority

The term 'minority' is not defined by the constitution or by any law. Any non-dominant group in a given locality is known as minority.

Constitution of India by Article 30 (1) recognizes two types of minorities, religious and linguistic minorities.

# Article 30 and Right to Property

The 44th amendment inserted clause 1a to Article 30. By that clause, the educational institutions established and administered by the minority have come to possess the right to property as a fundamental right.

Article 30 (1A) deals with the compensation for the acquisitioning of the property owned by the minority educational institutions. In case any such property is to be acquisitioned, then the compensation paid must be:

- Adequate
- Such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under Article 30 (1)

It implies that even if the compensation is more than the value of the property it needs to be paid by the state. In case of any violation in this regard remedies under Article 32 is available to the institution. Hence, the minority educational institutions enjoy right to property as a fundamental right even after 1978.

# Constitution (93rd Amendment) Act, 2005

The amendment inserted Article 15 (5). It empowers the state to make provisions in favour of the educational institutions including those run privately. This implies that reservation in favour of backward classes, SCs and STs can be applied to the private educational institutions by enacting a law. Such policy is not to be considered as violating the right guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (g). However, such a law is not applicable to the minority educational institutions.
# Minorities: Constitutional Rights and Safeguards

## RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES

Article 32 of the constitution provides for the right to constitutional remedies and enforcement of the fundamental rights. Article 32 (1) expressly guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court in case of infringement of any fundamental right. The Supreme Court has the power to grant relief in case of any infringement of the fundamental right. The court has the power to issue any direction or order or writs to enforce the fundamental rights. Article 32 mentions five writs namely the writ of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto.<sup>[6]</sup>

The Parliament may confer the power to issue writs upon any other court by law. In case the Parliament conferred the power to issue writs to any other court, then such court has to exercise the power without conflicting with the power of the Supreme Court [Article 32 (3)].

### Significance of Article 32

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What is the importance of right to constitutional remedies?

*IAS MAINS 2007*

Dr. Ambedkar called Article 32 as the 'heart and soul' of the fundamental rights. This clearly reveals the importance of the provision. The importance of Article 32 can be understood from the following:

- The enforcement of the fundamental rights and the remedies for any infringement is also guaranteed as a fundamental right. Thus, Article 32 validates the concept of 'guaranteed fundamental rights.' Without Article 32 other fundamental rights become meaningless.
- The suspension of fundamental rights is affected by the suspension of the enforcement of the right by Article 32.
- In case of violation of any fundamental rights one has the right to move the Supreme Court. In any other case the apex court cannot admit petition directly from the private individual. The court cannot refuse to admit a petition under Article 32 in case of violation of any fundamental right on any ground. Thus, the provision upholds the Supreme Court's position as 'Guarantor of Fundamental Rights'.
- It has enabled the Supreme Court to liberally interpret the concept of *locus standi* that has given rise to the 'Public Interest Litigation', which is regarded as the innovation of twentieth century.
- The Supreme Court derives its power to issue writs conferred by Article 32 (2), only from the right of the citizen guaranteed by Article 32 (1). The constitution places the obligation on the court to grant 'appropriate remedy', even if the citizen is ignorant of the legal procedure.<sup>[7]</sup>
- Judicial review flows out of Article 32 when it read along with Article 13 (2). According to Article 13, the state must not make any law that may infringe upon the fundamental rights. In case of any such law the Supreme Court has powers to declare the law *ultra vires* the constitution and therefore void.
- Articles 32 (3) empowers the Parliament to confer the power to issue writs to any other court than the Supreme Court. It in effect the Parliament may, if needed set up special courts dealing with the case involving infringement of fundamental rights.

<sup>6</sup> Refer chapter on judiciary for the details of the writs.

<sup>7</sup> The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part.

# Concept of Locus Standi and Public Interest Litigation

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Explain Public Interest Litigation. Who can file it and on what basis can it be rejected by the court of law? *IAS MAINS (2000)*

The concept of *locus standi* demands that any person whose right is violated shall alone have the right to move the Supreme Court seeking remedy. However, the Supreme Court by the judgments in various cases has expanded the concept.[8] This has given rise to the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL).

Public Interest Litigation is a proceeding in which an individual or group seeks relief in the interest of the general public and not for its own purpose. The person moves the court not for enforcing his personal right but to espouse the cause of large number of people who are suffering under some legal wrong or injury.

A Public Interest Litigation is moved on behalf of such person or class of persons who are unable to approach the court for relief by reason of poverty, helplessness or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position.

Reasons for Liberal Interpretation of Locus Standi

Justice Krishna Iyer in the Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union versus Union of India, (1981) case ruled that:

- 1. State must exercise its power to eradicate corruption but it must not infringe upon individuals' rights.
- 2. Liberal interpretation is essential for the judiciary to promote social justice for judicially reviewing administrative actions.
- 3. A healthy administrative system requires a liberal system for effective administration.
- 4. Participative public justice also requires active judiciary.

#### *Characteristics of Public Interest Litigation*

The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has the Following Characteristics:

- (i) It is not for the enforcement of any private individual right.
- (ii) In PIL party structure of the litigation is bipolar. That is in the PIL, there is no need for two parties instead one party may file the litigation and the other party may be the state or even there may not be a party.
- (iii) To file a PIL, there need not be a right violated. In case of a likelihood of the infringement of a right also a PIL may be filed.
- (iv) For a PIL to be filed there is no need for a past action and the remedy is not limited by the logic of the array of the parties.

Thus, 'Both the party structure and the matters in controversy are sprawling and amorphous, to be defined and adjusted or readjusted as the case may be, *ad hoc*, according as the exigencies of the emerging situations'. According to Justice Bhagwati, the essentials of public interest litigation are:

- 1. There must be a legal wrong caused to a person or to a determinate class of person, on whom burden is imposed in violation of law or without legal authority.
- 2. The wrong must arise from violation of any constitutional or legal right.

<sup>8</sup> D. C. Wadhwa versus State of Bihar, AIR 1987 SC 579, Fertilizer Corporation versus Union of India, AIR1981 SC 344.

- 3. The wronged person (or determinate groups of persons) must be unable to approach the court for relief, by reason of:
  - Poverty
  - Helplessness
  - Social or economic disability or socially or economically disadvantageous position
- 4. If the above conditions are satisfactory, then any member of the public can seek judicial redress for the above wrong.
- 5. But the court should be anxious to ensure that the person initiating the proceedings in acting *bona fide* to get redress for a public grievance and not to pursue any personal gain or from malicious motives.
- 6. If the case is otherwise appropriate for PIL then the court can act even on letters address to it.

## Exemption to Fundamental Rights

Certain laws are exempted from being declared void even if they conflict with the fundamental rights. Articles 31 A, 31 B and 31 C provide for the exemption of the laws conflicting with the fundamental rights from being declared void.

#### *Article 31 A: Saving of Laws for Acquisition of Estates*

Article 31 A was inserted by the constitution (First amendment) Act. It was inserted to provide for:

- Compulsory acquisitioning of properties or estates for implementing land reforms.
- Taking over the management of any private corporation in order to protect the interest of the workers.
- Nationalizing any sector of the economy or any industry in the interest of the public.

Any such law shall not be declared void even if the law is conflict with the rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 31. Land reforms were to be implemented in order to achieve the socialistic objectives of the constitution. But the fundamental right to property was an impediment. Thus, to override the litigations when the private properties were to be acquisitioned for any public purpose or to implement land reforms Article 31 A was inserted.

After the 44th amendment repealed right to property as a fundamental right Article 31A is still relevant in case of taking over the management of any organization or nationalizing any sector even the law conflicts with Article 19 (1) (g).

#### *Article 31B: Exempting Laws Included in Schedule IX*

Article 31B was inserted by the first amendment in 1951. Corresponding to Article 31B, Schedule IX was also included in the constitution. According to the provision, any law that is included in the Schedule IX shall not be 'questioned in a court of law' on the ground that it violates the fundamental rights and declared void.

However, the Supreme Court in the Kesavananda Bharti case ruled that judicial review being one of the 'basic features' of the constitution cannot be taken away by any amendment. Thus, in effect after Kesavananda Bharti case any law included in Schedule IX shall not be declared void but is subjected to judicial review. On reviewing if the court is satisfied that the law needs to be immunized by the Schedule IX, then the court may permit the continuance of the law in Schedule IX. Further, in 2007 in the Coelho case the Supreme Court ruled that the laws included in the Schedule IX are not immunized from judicial review.

#### *Including a Law in Schedule IX*

Any law passed by the Parliament or state legislature may be included in the Schedule IX. The law is included in the Schedule IX by a constitutional amendment. If the Parliament is satisfied that the law seeks to achieve a social objective or is in the public interest needs to be protected against being nullified, then the law can be included in Schedule IX by amending the schedule. Thus, the law is subjected to scrutiny in two occasions, one at the time of enactment and the other when being considered for including in Schedule IX.

## *Coelho Case and Judicial Review*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What was held in the Coelho case? In this context, can you say that judicial review is of key importance amongst the basic features of the constitution? *IAS MAINS: (GS 2016)*

The main contention in the Coelho case was whether a law inserted in the Schedule IX of the constitution was immunized from judicial review. The Supreme Court ruled that after Kesavananda Bharti case, the basic features of the constitution cannot be taken away by any amendment. Therefore, any law included in the schedule after 1 April 1973 will be subjected to judicial review and is not immunized from judicial review.

The court ruled that, 'The doctrine of basic structure is the very essence of the Constitution of India and therefore, there cannot be any act, rules or regulations which can overrule the basic structure doctrine. Since, the fundamental rights forms a part of the basic structure, therefore, every act inserted in the Schedule IX has to undergo the fundamental rights test'. Schedule IX being an integral part of the constitution any addition or deletion into the schedule must also comply with the doctrine of basic structure.

This landmark judgement reaffirms the importance of judicial review as a key feature of the constitution. It may be noted that more than 200 legislations were inserted in the Schedule IX after 1973. The need for immunizing this, many legislations under Schedule IX has to be reviewed. Such legislations are immunized from being struck down even if they are inconsistent with the fundamental rights. As long as the legislations are serving the social objectives of the constitution the immunity is justified. However, utmost care needs to be taken to ensure such immunity is not used for securing ulterior 'political' motives. Hence, the case makes judicial review of key importance amongst the basic features of the constitution.

#### *Article 31C: Laws Giving Effect to Certain Directive Principles*

Article 31C was inserted by the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act, 1971. It immunizes the law enacted to implement the Directive Principles given in Articles 39 (b) and (c). Articles 39 (b) and (c) represent the doctrine of distributive justice and achievement of socialistic goals of:

- Prevention of concentration of wealth.
- The ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the common good.
- Any law seeking to achieve these goals may be impeded by the fundamental rights. Considering the importance of the constitutional and socialistic objectives, the DPSPs are to be provided supremacy over the fundamental rights. Hence, Article 31 C was inserted.

As inserted by 25th Amendment Act, Article 31 C provided that:

- Any law giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Articles 39 (b) and (c) must contain a memorandum that it is for giving effect to the said DPSPs.
- Any law containing such a memorandum shall not be questioned in a court of law.

### *Article 31 C and 42nd Amendment*

Forty-second Amendment expanded the scope of Article 31C to immunize any law enacted to give effect to any of the DPSP even if it conflicts with the fundamental rights. It was argued that DPSP represents the collective liberty of the society and fundamental rights represent the individual rights. Further, the DPSPs also represent the conditions required for the full enjoyment of the fundamental rights. Hence, the DPSPs must be given primacy over fundamental rights. Once the DPSPs are fully implemented the conditions for the full enjoyment of fundamental rights is ensured. It was assumed that there is an inherent conflict between the DPSP and fundamental rights. However, the Supreme Court, in the Minerva Mills case struck down the 42nd Amendment expanding the scope of Article 31 C.
