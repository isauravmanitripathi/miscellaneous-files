# ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA

Part XV between Articles 324 and 329 deal with elections. This Part deals with the conduct of free and fair elections, right to vote, etc. Article 324 provides for an independent Election Commission entrusted with the superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of all elections. The Election Commission conducts the elections to Parliament and to the legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of President and Vice-President.

# A Political Party is Recognized by the Election Commission Only if it

- Engaged in political activity for a continuous period of five years
- Has returned atleast one member of the Lok Sabha for every 25 members of the House or any fraction of that number elected from that State or;
- Has returned at least one member to the Legislative Assembly of that State for every thirty members of that Assembly or any fraction of that number or;
- Has polled not less than 6 percent of the total number of valid votes polled by all contesting candidates at the general elections
- If a party is recognised in four states then it is recognised as National party

# Composition of the Commission

The constitution does not provide for the complete composition of the commission. Article 324(2) provides that the Election Commission shall consist of a Chief Election Commissioner and such other Commissioners as the President may, from time to time, fix. The Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed by the President.

88 A

The power to determine the size of the Commission is vested in the President who exercises the power with the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. In effect the size of the Commission is determined by the Council of Ministers. This has attracted severe criticism.

At present, the Commission consists of a Chief Election Commissioner and two other Election Commissioners. But it was single-member body until 1989 with only the Chief Election Commissioner. From October 1989 to the 1 January 1990, it became a three-member body with R. V. S. Peri Sastri (C.E.C) and S. S. Dhanoa and V. S. Seigell as Election Commissioners. Then from January 1990 to September 1993, it was a single-member Commission and again from 1 October 1993, it has become a three-member Commission. The Chief Election Commissioner will be the Chairman of the Commission and the other Commissioners are the members.

The Chief Election Commissioner and other Elections Commissioners enjoy equal powers and equal salaries similar to that of Supreme Court judge. The salary and other expenditures of the Commission are NOT charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.

In case of any difference of opinion between the CEC and the Election Commissioners then the decision shall be made according to the opinion of the majority.

## Term of Office

The Chief Election Commissioner or an Election Commissioner shall hold office for a term of six years from the date on which he assumes his office.

#### Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)

- • VVPAT is an independent system attached with the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM).
- It allows the voters to verify that their votes are cast as intended.
- When a vote is cast, a slip is printed containing the serial number, name and symbol of the candidate and remains exposed through a transparent window for seven seconds.
- Thereafter, this printed slip automatically gets cut and falls in the sealed dropbox of the **VVPAT**

#### *Regional Commissioners*

The President may appoint the Regional Election Commissioners to assist the Election Commission before any election. The tenure and the conditions of service of Regional Election Commissioners are determined by the President.

#### *Removal Procedure*

The constitution provides for different procedure for the removal of Chief Election Commissioners and other Election Commissioners. The Chief Election Commissioner can be removed on the like grounds and in the like manner as a judge of Supreme Court is removed.

That is, the Chief Election Commissioner can only be removed by the President only on the address of each House of the Parliament passed by a special majority on the ground that he is guilty of proved misbehaviour or suffers from incapacity. The election Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners can be removed only on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner.

# Elections

The procedure for the election of the President (Article 54) and the Vice-President (Article 66) is provided in the constitution. The procedure for election to the legislatures of the union and the States is left to legislation. However, the constitution provides for certain principles governing the elections namely:

- (a) **No Communal Representation:** The constitution does not provide for communal, separate or special representation. All the constituency are single-member territorial constituencies.
- (b) **Single Electoral Roll:** There shall be one electoral roll for every territorial constituency for election to either House of Parliament or to the State legislature and no person shall be excluded from such roll-on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them (Article 325).
- (c) **Universal Adult Suffrage:** The election shall be on the basis of adult suffrage, i.e., every person who is a citizen of India and completed 18 years of age shall be entitled to vote at the election. However, he must not be disqualified by any provision of the constitution or of any law made by the appropriate legislature on the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of mind, crime, or corrupt or illegal practice (Article 326).

#### National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution

'Elections are critical to the maintenance and development of democratic tradition because at one level, these are influenced by the political culture in which they operate, but at another, they also generate strong influences that can improve or distort this political culture.'

## Power of Legislature

The Union Parliament has the power to make laws relating to all matters in connection with the election subjected to the above principles and the provisions of the constitution. This is in accordance with Article 327 and the Entry 72 of List I in the 7th Schedule. Hence, the election to the Houses of Parliament and the State legislatures are conducted in accordance with the law enacted by the Parliament.

However, the state legislature has a subsidiary power in this respect. It can legislate on all electoral matters relating to the state legislature on such matters that are not covered by legislation by Parliament. The laws of the State legislature shall, in other words, be valid if they are not repugnant to laws made by Parliament and, of course, to provisions of the constitution (Article 328).

Parliament has enacted the Representation of the People Acts, 1950, 1951, as well as the Delimitation Commission Acts, 1962, 1972, to prescribe the mode of election, and the formation and delimitation of the constituencies relating to election.

#### Reservation in Elections

- Seats reserved according to their proportion of population with respect to the total population of a State.
- Reservation is for seats in the Lok Sabha as also the Legislative Assembly (Articles 330 and 332).
- Two members of the Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha and one member in a State Assembly.
- • One third of the seats reserved for women in the *Panchayats* and municipalities.

# Election Disputes

India being the world's largest democracy with large-scale election, disputes are bound to arise, such as:

- Whether the procedure for election was properly followed or;
- Whether any candidate returned as member suffered from any disqualification under the law or the constitution or;
- Whether a candidate who ought to have been returned has been declared not elected.

For the decision of such disputes, the Article 329 of the Constitution provides that the ordinary courts of the land will have no jurisdiction and that any question relating to an election can be agitated only by an election petition, as provided for by law. Article 329 (b) provides:

'Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature.'

#### Adult Suffrage

- The Presidential and Vice- Presidential Election Act, 1952.
- The Representation of People Act, 1950.
- The Representation of People Act, 1951.
- The Delimitation Act, 1952, 1962, 1972 and 2002.

Under the Representation of the People Act, as it stood at the end of 1996, the power to decide an election petition is vested in the high court, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

By Article 323B of the Constitution, as inserted by the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, power has been conferred on the appropriate legislature to set-up a tribunal for the adjudication of disputes relating to elections of the legislature concerned, by making law. By the law the jurisdiction of courts over the adjudication of election disputes can be excluded. However, a Special Leave Petition may be made to the Supreme Court under Article 136 on any such matter.

In short, when any such law is made in exercise of this power, the high court will cease to have any jurisdiction over election disputes; they will be determined only by the Administrative Tribunal set-up by law, with appeal from the decision of such tribunal to the Supreme Court by special leave under Article136.

#### *Disputes in Election of President, Vice-President, Prime Minister, Speaker*

According to Article 71, the exclusive forum for adjudicating disputes relating to the election of the President and Vice-President is the Supreme Court. There is no special provision for the Prime Minister or the Speaker of the House of the People, so that any dispute relating to election to these offices is to be determined only by an election petition before the high court, according to Article 329 (b).

# Model Code of Conduct<sup>[1]</sup>

The Model Code of Conduct for guidance of political parties and candidates is a set of norms which has been evolved with the consensus of political parties who have consented to abide by the principles embodied in the said code and also binds them to respect and observe it in its letter and spirit.

The Model Code of Conduct is enforced from the date of announcement of election schedule by the Election Commission and is operational till the process of elections is completed. The Model Code of Conduct is applicable:

- (a) During general elections to House of People (Lok Sabha), the code is applicable throughout the country.
- (b) During general elections to the Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha), the code is applicable in the entire State.
- (c) During by-elections, the code is applicable in the entire district or districts in which the constituency falls.

The Election Commission ensures its observance by political party(ies) in power, including ruling parties at the Centre and in the States and contesting candidates in the discharge of its constitutional duties for conducting the free, fair and peaceful elections to the Parliament and the State legislatures under Article 324 of the Constitution of India.

It is also ensured that official machinery for the electoral purposes is not misused. Further, it is also ensured that electoral offences, malpractices and corrupt practices such as impersonation, bribing and inducement of voters, threat and intimidation to the voters are prevented by all means. In case of violation, appropriate measures are taken.

The model code of conduct is applicable for the elections to panchayats and municipalities as well. However, the respective state election commissions may make required modifications in accordance with the needs and suitability for the states.
