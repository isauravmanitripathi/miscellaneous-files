# INTRODUCTION

Part V, Chapter II of the constitution between Articles 79 and 123 deal with the provisions relating to the Union Parliament. Article 79 provides that, 'there shall be a Parliament which shall consist of the President and two Houses to be known respectively as the Council of States and the House of the People'. The President is not a member of the Parliament but he is a constituent part of the Parliament. Therefore, the President enjoys vast legislative powers.  $<sup>(1)</sup>$  Hence, the constitution prescribes that the President must be qualified to be elected as a member of Lok Sabha.</sup>

# COMPOSITION OF RAJYA SABHA: ARTICLE 80

Rajya Sabha is the upper House of the Indian Parliament. In contrast to the House of Lords of the English Parliament, Rajya Sabha is modelled on the American Senate. However, the number of members allotted to each State is in proportion to the population of the State, unlike the American system where all the States have equal membership. Thus, it is considered as a non-federal feature of the Indian Constitution. The Schedule IV of the constitution provides for the allocation of seats in Rajya Sabha for the States.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Who and what does the Indian Parliament consist of? *IAS MAINS (2005)*

1 For details of the legislative powers of the President refer the Chapter on Union Executive— President.

The total sanctioned strength of the Rajya Sabha is 250. Of these 238 members are to be elected as the representatives of the States and 12 members are to be nominated by the President from among the persons having special knowledge and eminence in the fields of literature, arts, science and social service. The present strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, of which 233 members represent the States and the UTs of Delhi and Puducherry and 12 are nominated by the President.

#### Rajya Sabha History

- Rajya Sabha traces its origin to Montagu–Chelmsford Report of 1918.
- • Provision for creating a second chamber to be known as 'Council of State' was contained in Government of India Act, 1919.
- It was created and came into existence in 1921.
- • Governor–General was the ex officio President of the Council of State.

The members of Rajya Sabha representing the States are elected by the members of the State Legislative Assembly. The members of Rajya Sabha are indirectly elected by the proportional representation system by means of a single transferable vote.<sup>[2]</sup>

Article 80 (5) provides that the members representing the Union Territories are to be elected in the manner prescribed by the Parliament by law. However, the Parliament has not prescribed any special procedure for that and they are elected in the same manner as the members representing the States are elected. The members representing the UTs of Delhi and Puducherry are to be elected by the members of the respective Legislative Assemblies. Currently, 4 members represent the UTs. Delhi has three members and Puducherry has one member in the Rajya Sabha.

#### Reasons for the Proportional Representation

Rajya Sabha is a federal House representing the States in the centre. However, the constitution envisages the representation must be of the people of the State and not that of the government of the State. The members of the Legislative Assembly vote on behalf of the people of the State. Hence, the proportional representation is prescribed for the elections to the Rajya Sabha. This will ensure that all people including the minorities are adequately represented.

#### Points to Remember

- Rajya Sabha is the Federal House.
- Rajya Sabha is chaired by Vice-President, a non-member of the House.
- While the members of the House have a term of six years, the Chairperson has only a term of five years.
- Rajya Sabha does to have financial powers.
- Members are elected by proportional representation system.
- Approval of Rajya Sabha is enough in case an emergency proclamation is made during when Lok Sabha is dissolved.

#### Qualification of Members

Article 84 prescribes the qualification of members of Rajya Sabha. To be a member of Rajya Sabha any person should:

- (a) Be a citizen of India;
- (b) Have completed the age of 30 years;
- (c) Possess other qualification as prescribed by the law of the Parliament. Section 3 of the Representation of People's Act, 1951, prescribes that to be a member of Rajya Sabha any person should be a registered voter in any parliamentary constituency in India.
- (d) Article 84 also provides that a person contesting in the election to Rajya Sabha has to 'subscribe an oath or affirmation according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule'.

There is no need for the person to be a domicile of a State which he represents in the Rajya Sabha because:

- 1. The constitution provides only for single citizenship. The very idea of providing single citizenship as a nation-building process and to promote Indianness among the citizens.
- 2. Although a member who is not a domicile or native of particular State, he will be representing the interests of the State which he represents in the House not those of his State of origin. This is ensured by the whip system. This will be enabling the nation-building process in another sense.
- 3. Further, it may not be viable for any person to represent a State in the House unless he had a practical knowledge about and standing in the State, so as to get elected from the State.

If the rule of origin is prescribed the above purposes will be defeated. However, in the present context of Indian politics the membership of Rajya Sabha is more used as political bargain for electoral alliances and to appease the party heavy weights. Further, it is also used as an incentive for loyalty to political leadership. This needs to be controlled and electoral reforms must include this.

#### Leader of the House Rajya Sabha

- If the PM is a member of Rajya Sabha, he will be the Leader of the House.
- • If he is not then he will nominate a minister who is a member of Rajya Sabha to be the Leader of the House.
- • Leader of the House occupies the first seat in the Chamber in first row at right the side of the chair so that he is easily available to the Presiding Officer for consultation.
- Leader of the House is consulted by the Chairman in regard to arrangement of business in the House.
- • He ensures that all possible and reasonable facilities are made available for a meaningful discussion on any matter.
- He is the spokesperson of the House in expressing sense of the House and represents it on ceremonial or formal occasions.

#### Duration of the House

Rajya Sabha is a standing (permanent) House and therefore, is not subjected to dissolution. However, one third of the members of the House retire every two years. Hence, the election to Rajya Sabha is conducted once in every two years i.e., at the beginning of every third year. Every member of the House has a term of six years and those who have completed the six-year term will retire.

However, in the first House the members retired at the expiry of two years based on their seniority by age. That is, the senior-most members by age retired at the expiry of the first two years and subsequently the six-year term got established.

**RA 80** 

#### Utility of Rajya Sabha

The utility of Rajya Sabha was thoroughly debated in the Constituent Assembly. There were arguments placed against the House as some of the members considered it to be redundant and superfluous. However, it was decided to have the House for the following reasons:

- 1. Given the immense diversity of India society the founding fathers decided to have federal constitution with bicameral legislatures. Rajya Sabha is a federal House representing the interest of the States in the union legislations and policies. With the view of national interest, the local interests must not be sacrificed. Rajya Sabha ensures this.
- 2. Rajya Sabha provides opportunity for senior statesmen who are not willing or capable to contest election to Lok Sabha to enter the Parliament so that their talent and experience is not lost to the nation.
- 3. Rajya Sabha acts as a 'revising House' on the legislations enacted by the Lok Sabha. Lok Sabha being a popular body may act with haste. Further, Lok Sabha being a directly elected body may be guided by the needs of the electoral politics which might undermine public welfare.
- 4. Rajya Sabha can potentially stop any attempt to drastically change the constitution or law by delaying and revising. Hence, the House prevents any undue encroachment on the constitution or a law.
- 5. Although the constitution does not vest financial powers in the Rajya Sabha, the system of departmental standing committee has been designed to make use of the experience of the membership of Rajya Sabha.

#### Rajya Sabha—Special Powers

As a federal House, Rajya Sabha has special powers. The following are the special powers:

- 1. By Article 249, Rajya Sabah has the power to pass a resolution by a majority of not less than twothirds of members present and voting saying that it is 'necessary or expedient in the national interest' authorising the Parliament to enact a law on any matter given in the State List.
- 2. By Article 312, Rajya Sabha has the power to pass a resolution by a majority of not less than twothirds of members present and voting and declares that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to create one or more All India Services common to the union and the States, then the Parliament can create new All India Services by law such.
- 3. Rajya Sabha has the powers to approve the Proclamation of Emergency—national, constitutional or financial emergency, if at the time of Proclamation of Emergency the Lok Sabha was dissolved.

#### Role of Rajya Sabha in the Changing Political Scenario

In the changing political scenario after the 1990s and the turn of the millennium, Rajya Sabha plays a very significant role. After the rise and growth of the regional political parties the national parties that come to power in the centre did to enjoy the majority in the Rajya Sabha. This gave a significant role for Rajya Sabha to secure the interest of the States and strengthen the federal structure. This was all the truer in the era of the coalition.

Without the majority support in the Rajya Sabha the Government was not able to bring about legislations according to their whims and fancies. It has effectively prevented the amendments like that of 42nd amendment.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Explain the relevance of Rajya Sabha as a second chamber in the federal set-up of Indian parliamentary system. *IAS MAINS (2003)*

In what ways is the Rajya Sabha expected to play a special role in today's changing political scenario? *IAS MAINS 1999)*

With the constitution of the Departmentally Related Standing Committees, the experience and wisdom of the Rajya Sabha members has been fully utilized by the Indian Parliament. The constitution does not confer financial powers to the Rajya Sabha and the House can retain the Money Bills only for 14 days. The Departmentally Related Standing Committees system has done away with this anomaly.

#### COMPOSITION OF LOK SABHA

Lok Sabha is the lower House of the Indian Parliament. Members of the Lok Sabha are elected directly by the people from the single member territorial constituencies. The total sanctioned strength of the House is 552. Of the 552, 530 members are to be elected by the people of the Sates and 20 members from the Union Territories. The President nominates two members from the Anglo-Indian community if in the opinion of the President the community is not adequately represented (Article 331). At present Lok Sabha has 545 members—543 are elected and 2 nominated from Anglo-Indian community.

The members of the House are elected directly by the people by a system of 'First Past the Post System' by means of adult suffrage exercised in a secret ballot. In this system the candidate who has secured the maximum number of votes out of all the contestants in the election.

#### TABLE 14.1 Difference between Nominated and Elected Members

#### Reasons for First Past the Post System

- It is a simple system to administer and simplifies the counting of votes. It is more suitable for India where the literacy rate among the voters is significantly low.
- In this system the candidate and the party fielding the candidate are inseparable and enables the elector would be clear about his choice.
- In a system of single member territorial constituency, it helps the development of healthy relationship between the legislator (MP or MLA) and the people who he represents.
- It can effectively prevent any political party with extremist tendencies because such parties may not secure enough votes in any constituency.
- In a society with vast diversity, the system makes the political parties to represent the diverse sections of the society in general. This is because the party needs the support of all sections and cannot be concentrating on a single section. For example, in India, the parties representing the sectional interest or the caste-based parties have not been able to rise to power.

TABLE 14.2 Difference between Proportional Representation and First Past the Post System

- Further, it also gives rise to a coherent opposition.
- The system enables the voter to assess the performance of the individual candidates. For instance, it provides the opportunity to the independent candidates (candidates who do not represent any political party).

However, the system is not without demerits. The demerits of the system are:

- The representatives are not elected on the basis of proportionate majority. As a consequence, the candidate who is not favoured by the majority end up representing the constituency.
- It can potentially exclude the minority, women and other weaker sections. In the system the party field candidate who is broadly acceptable to the community that has a relatively maximum vote share.
- It also promotes the vote bank politics. The winnability of the candidate governs the electoral strategy of the parties than the public interest or the performance. Thus, it affects the voting behaviour of the voters.
- All political parties field the candidates belonging to a particular community or caste aiming to tap the winnability based on the votes of a particular dominant caste or community. Thus, the votes get split.
- The consequence of the vote bank politics is the emergence of the political parties based on caste and communal interests but without any political philosophy or strong socio-political objectives.
- Yet, another consequence is the influence of the money and muscle power in the elections.
- In the system the marginal and swinging voters largely determine the outcome of the election. For instance, in any constituency certain small proportion of voters may be swinging in their allegiance to political parties. Such swinging votes make votes of the other major portion insignificant. Hence, the political parties tend to appease these minority voters than focussing on the performance.

## Single Member Territorial Constituency

For the purpose of Lok Sabha elections, the country is divided into single member territorial constituency. The process of dividing the constituency is known as 'Delimitation' and the power to exercise delimitation is vested in the Election Commission.

# Delimitation of Constituencies

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Discuss the methods of delimiting constituencies for parliamentary elections in India.

*IAS MAIN (2002)*

Delimitation is the 'process of fixing limits or boundaries of territorial constituencies in a country or a State having a legislative body. The job of delimitation is assigned to a Delimitation Commission or a Boundary Commission.

Articles 82 and 170 of the constitution provides for the readjustment of the number of seats in the House of People and Legislative Assemblies after every census. Accordingly, the power to delimit the constituencies is done by the Election Commission. But the 42nd amendment provided that the delimitation shall be done only after year 2000. Until then the number of constituencies shall be fixed on the basis of the population figures of census 1971.

As a result, after the census 2001 the readjustment of seats needs to be done. But the population in the southern States such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala had decreased whereas the States such as Rajasthan and UP the population had increased. If the readjustment exercise were to be undertaken the number of seats in the Lok Sabha for the southern States would have to be reduced and it was not acceptable to these States. It would also be illogical to reduce the representation of the States for effectively implementing the population control measures.

To avoid such consequence, the 84th amendment was enacted. It provided that the readjustment of the number of seats shall be done only after the first census after 2026. Hence, the readjustment of the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assemblies was postponed for next 25 years. However, due to the change in demographic pattern as result of migration triggered by globalization, economic growth, etc., it was decided to:

- Adjust the boundaries of the Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies
- Seats allocated to SCs
- Seats allocated to STs.

Towards fulfilling the exercise, the Delimitation Commission was set-up in 2002 under the Chairmanship of Mr Justice Kuldip Singh.

The orders of the Delimitation Commission have the force of law and cannot be called in question before any court. The orders need to be laid before the House of the People and the concerned state Legislative Assembly however, the House has no power to modify the orders.

#### Qualification of Members

Article 84 prescribes the qualification of members of Lok Sabha. To be a member of Lok Sabha any person should:

- (a) Be a citizen of India;
- (b) Have completed the age of 25 years;
- (c) Possess other qualification as prescribed by the law of the Parliament. Section 3 of the Representation of People's Act, 1951, prescribes that to be a member of Rajya Sabha any person should be a registered voter in any parliamentary constituency in India.

#### Disqualification of Members

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

What are the grounds of disqualification of a Member of Parliament from either House? Quote relevant provisions in your answer. *IAS MAINS (2010)*

Article 102 deals with the disqualification of the members of the Parliament. According to Article 102 (1), persons are disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of Parliament if he:

- Holds any office of profit under the Union or the State government or;
- Suffers from unsoundness of mind or:
- He is an undischarged insolvent or;
- He is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily renounced the citizenship of India or;
- He is disqualified under any law made by Parliament.

**RA 80** 

As a sequel to Article 102 (1) (e), the Representation of People's Act lays down the following grounds on which a person is disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of Parliament:

- A member of Parliament should not have been found guilty by a court or an Election Tribunal of certain election offences or corrupt practices in election.
- He should not have been convicted by a court in India of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of not less than two years.
- He should not have failed to lodge an account of his election expenses within the time and in the manner prescribed.
- He should not have been dismissed for corruption or disloyalty from government service.
- He should not be a director or managing agent or hold an office of profit under any corporation in which the government has any financial interest.
- He should not have any interest in government contracts, execution of government work or service.

These disqualifications should not exist on the date of nomination of a candidate for election and on the date when the results are declared.

**Disqualification on ground of Defection:** Article 102 (2) provides that a person is disqualified for being chosen as and for being a member of Parliament if he is disqualified under the Tenth Schedule on the ground of defection. A person is disqualified on the round of defection under the Tenth Schedule if:

- 1. He voluntarily gives up the membership of the party which had set him as a candidate in the election.
- 2. If he votes or abstains from voting contrary to any direction issued by his political party, without obtaining permission of such party and the party has not condoned such voting or abstention within 15 days from the date of such voting or abstention.
- 3. If any nominated member joins a party after the expiry of six months from the date, he takes his seat.
- 4. A member who has been elected as an independent member shall be disqualified if he joins any political party.

![](_page_7_Figure_14.jpeg)

FIGURE 14.1: Disqualification on ground of Defection

**Exception to the Rule of Defection:** According to Para 4 of Schedule 10, the disqualification as a consequence of defection does not apply if the original party of a member merges with another party and he either changes his political party as a consequence of the merger or does not accept merger and opts to function as a separate group. A merger is deemed to take place only if not less than two-third of the members of the legislative party agree to such merger.

#### **Decision on Disqualification**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Which of the cases regarding disqualification's for membership of either House of Parliament are decided by the President? *IAS MAINS (1998)*

In case of disqualification of any member on the grounds given in Article 102, the President has the power to make decision. The President shall make the decision after consulting the Election Commission and the opinion of the Election Commission is binding on the President. The power is vested in the President by Article 103.

In case of disqualification on the grounds of defection the power to make decision is vested in the Speaker in case of Lok Sabha and the Chairman in case of Rajya Sabha. The decision of the Speaker or Chairman shall be final (Para 6). The decision of the Speaker or Chairman shall not be questioned in a court of law. Para 7 of the Schedule 10 expressly bars the jurisdiction of any court.

#### Vacation of Seats: Article 101

In the Parliament, a seat may fall vacant in case a member:

- Resigns by writing under his hand addressed to the Chairman or the Speaker or;
- Dies or;
- Disqualified on the grounds given in Article 102 or;
- Disqualified on the ground of defection or;
- Becomes a member of Houses—both Lok Sabha and legislature of a state or;
- Is absent for a period of sixty days without permission of the House.

#### Duration of the House

The Lok Sabha shall have a term of five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer. However, the term of the Lok Sabha may be extended by one year when a proclamation of national emergency is in operation. Similarly, the House may be dissolved before the expiry of the term by the President.

#### SESSIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT

Article 85 deals with the sessions of the Parliament. The President has the powers to summon and prorogue the sessions of the Houses of the Parliament and dissolve the Lok Sabha. The constitution lays down the condition that not more than six months shall expire between two sessions of the Parliament. Hence, in any year at least two sessions of the Parliament must be held. It is a constitutional obligation on the President to summon the House(s) even if the Council of Ministers did not advise him to summon the House.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

#### **IAS MAINS (2006)**

- Explain the following terms:
- (i) Dissolution of the House

What is the maximum gap between two sessions of the Indian Parliament? *IAS MAINS (1999)* What is meant by the 'lame duck session' of the legislature? *IAS MAINS (2002)*

#### Session

The meeting of the House of Parliament held period of time is known as a Session of the House. A period from date of commencing the first sitting of the House is till the date on which the President prorogues the House or in case of Lok Sabha dissolves, the House is a Session of the Parliament.

A session of the House consists of several 'sitting' of the House. The meeting of the House held to transact a business every day is known as a sitting of the House. There can be more than one sitting on a day. Every sitting close when the Presiding Officer of the House adjourns the House.

Usually, there are three sessions of the Parliament every year namely, the Budget Session, Monsoon Session and Winter Session. The Budget Session is the first session of every year and is the longest of all sessions. The Winter Session is the shortest session.

Quorum is the minimum number of members to be present for any siting of the House to be conducted. According to Article 100, the quorum for any sitting is one-tenth of the total membership of the House.

In case of state legislatures, Article 189 prescribes that the quorum shall be ten members or onetenth of the total number of members of the House, whichever is greater.

**Lame duck Session:** The last session of a dissolved Lok Sabha is known as a lame duck session. The session is held after the general election to the Lok Sabha and so in effect it is the first session after the general election.

The session is meant for bidding farewell to those members of the dissolved house who have not contested the election or been elected again in the general election. No major legislative business is transacted in the session as the House has no mandate and the new House after the general election is yet to be constituted. Hence, the session is known as 'Lame duck session' and the members are known as 'Lame ducks'.

**Summoning of the House:** Summoning of the House refers to the calling the Houses for the session. It is the power of the President to be exercised with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

**Proroguing the House:** This is also the power of the President which exercise with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. When prorogued the session comes to an end. The President can prorogue the session of the House at any time.

**Adjournment:** Adjournment is the suspension of work in a sitting announced by the Presiding officer. It may range from a few minutes to days together.

**Adjournment Sine die:** When the Presiding Officer adjourns the House without fixing any time or any date for the next meeting it is called adjournment *sine die*. *Sine die* means without setting a day (for the next meeting) or in other words where the adjournment is for an indefinite period. Usually on the last day of the session the House is adjourned *sine die*.

**Dissolution:** Dissolution ends the life of the Lok Sabha. A new Lok Sabha takes its place after the general elections are held. Rajya Sabha being a permanent chamber cannot be dissolved. Only the Lok Sabha is subjected to dissolution.

#### POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE PARLIAMENT

Articles 105 and 194 provide for the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of the Parliament and the state legislatures respectively. 'Parliamentary privilege' refers to 'certain rights and immunities enjoyed by each House of Parliament and committees of each House collectively, and by members of each House individually'.

# Privileges of Parliament

The privileges of the Parliament are grouped as the privileges of the individual members and those of the House collectively. The privileges enjoyed by the members individually are:

- (a) Freedom of speech
- (b) Freedom from being a witness
- (c) Freedom from arrest

#### Contempt of the House

#### Breach of Privilege

Any disregard or wilfully attacking the privileges of the House or any of its members. All breaches of privilege are contempt of the House.

#### Contempt of the House

Any act or omission which:

- Obstructs or impedes the House of Parliament or; state legislature in the performance of its functions or;
- Impedes any member or officers of such House in the discharge of his or her duty or;
- Has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results even though there is no precedent of the offence or;
- • Wilful disobedience to the orders of the House or its committee even if there is no breach of any privilege.

**Freedom of Speech:** The members of the Parliament or state legislature shall have the right to freedom of speech in the House. A member of Parliament or state legislature shall not be held answerable in a court of law for whatever he speaks on the floor of the House while participating in any proceeding of the House.

However, such freedom is subjected to the rules of procedures of the House. The members shall not speak anything or in any manner which may adversely affect the dignity or decorum of the House.

Another restriction imposed on the freedom is that the members of Parliament or state legislature shall not discuss anything on the conduct of a judge of Supreme Court or high court except when the resolution for the removal of the Judge is being considered. This restriction is imposed by Articles 121 and 211 respectively.

This freedom of speech is different from the freedom of speech guaranteed to the citizen by Article 19 (1) (a). While the freedom of speech as a fundamental right is restricted on the grounds given in Article 19 (2), the freedom of the members of the legislature is completely immunized from being restricted or questioned in a court of law.

**Freedom from Being a Witness:** A member of Parliament or state legislature shall be summoned to be a witness before a court of law without the permission of the House, during when the Parliament or the state legislature is in session.

**Freedom from Arrest:** A member of Parliament or state legislature shall not be arrested during

- 1. The time when the House in which he is a member is meeting.
- 2. The time when the Parliamentary committee in which he is a member is meeting.
- 3. The period of forty days before and after the meeting of the House or its committee.

However, this immunity is only on the civil arrest and does not apply to arrest in any criminal proceeding or preventive detention.

**Privileges of the House:** The Houses of Union Parliament and the state legislatures as a whole enjoy the following:

- 1. House has the power to exclude the strangers during any of its proceedings.
- 2. House has the power to permit or restrain the publishing of any of its proceedings. Also, the House.
- 3. House has the exclusive powers to make rules of procedure regulating the business in the House. Such rules shall not be questioned in a court of law.
- 4. House has the power to punish for the breach of its privileges or its contempt. $(4)$

# Codification of Parliamentary Privileges – Difficulties

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

**Article 105:** Powers, privileges, immunities of Parliament and its members—Reasons for absence of legal codification and how it can be addressed? *IAS MAINS GS (2014)*

Unlike the English Constitution, the Indian Constitution expressly provides for the codification of the privileges of the Parliament and the state legislatures. Both Articles 105 and 196 lays down that the powers, privileges and immunities of the Parliament and state legislature to be as those of the English House of Commons (the mention about the English House of Commons is deleted after 44th amendment), until codified by the law of the Parliament and state legislatures respectively.

There have also been demands to codify the privileges from several quarters and the Supreme Court in many has also ruled in favour of codifying the privileges. However, the privileges are yet to be codified. The following are the difficulties in codifying the privileges of the legislatures:

• Though termed as privileges, they are in fact powers of the Parliament as an institution. Such privileges are essential for any member of Parliament to speak in the House without fear. Hence, it is difficult to codify the privileges in definite terms.

**RA 80** 

<sup>4</sup> IAS MAINS (2000) What is Contempt of Parliament? Refer the Table 14.1.

- Members of the Houses enjoying the mandate of the people need to be facilitated to perform their duty without any obstruction or fear of judicial intervention. This requires the privileges to be provided in broad terms.
- When codified the parliamentary privileges may be subjected to judicial review on the ground of conflicting with fundamental rights. This would be interfering in the functioning of the legislatures.
- If the privileges are codified in definite terms it would result in challenging the penal decisions of the House in cases of breach of privileges or contempt of the House. Thus, resulting in increasing the burden of the courts and conflict between the judiciary and the legislature.

**Need for Codifying Parliamentary Privileges:** Though the above arguments are placed against codifying the parliamentary privileges, the need for codifying them is inevitable. The Supreme Court has also ruled in favour of codifying them in several cases. The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution said 'In a democratic society, any privileges for a section or class of the people are anachronistic, any undefined privileges like the privileges of Parliament are even more so.' This adds strength to the arguments on the need for codifying the privileges. The arguments placed for the codifying the privileges are as follows:

- (a) Indian Parliament is created by the constitution which defines its powers and functions. The Parliament is not sovereign unlike the English Parliament. The Houses enjoy the special privileges and immunities as they are representative bodies voted by the people. It is clear that the sovereignty is with the people and constitution. Hence, it is essential to codify the privileges.
- (b) The conduct of the members of the Legislature has become questionable. The members have taken cover behind the privileges to escape charges of corruption. The Supreme Court had taken note of this in the P. V. Narashimha Rao case. The members of Parliament belonging to Jharkhand Mukti Morchi (JMM) were bribed to vote in favour of the ruling party on the confidence vote. In the case it was held that the MPs who took money to vote cannot be punished by the judiciary on corruption charges as it was an issue of privilege of the House.
- (c) The conduct of the members in the House is also unbecoming of their stature and role envisaged by the constitution. Often members on one or the other pretext shout and gather in the Well of the House disrupting the functioning of the House. Similarly, they also indulge in the misbehaving with the Speaker or the Presiding Officer. At times the House has also been ransacked. The recent example of the behaviour of the members in the Tamil Nadu Assembly in February 2017, when the present Council of Ministers sought the confidence vote.
- (d) The power of privileges has been used against the freedom of press in several occasions. When any comment is made on the functioning of the Parliament or the Houses of the state legislature the House had overreacted and had been adversely affecting the right to freedom of expression.
- (e) In the recent times it is also noted that the Ministers attempt to give false information to the House. In 2015, the Minister for Environment and Forests, Tamil Nadu informed the House that Coca Cola Company not authorized to use river water and no land was allotted to the company. However, on the same day an affidavit was filed on behalf of the government of Tamil Nadu in the Madras High Court in which the government had accepted that the company was authorized for the same.
- (f) The privileges are conflicting with the Right to Information of the citizen. The Public Information Officer of Rajya Sabha refused to disclose the information on the questions asked by the members in the House. The PIO took the cover of Section 8 (1) (c) which exempts the information relating to the privileges of the Parliament.

**Parliamentary Privileges and Judicial Review:** Although the privileges of the Houses are immunized from being questioned in a court of law, the Supreme Court in several cases ruled that the scope of the privileges is subjected to judicial review and would be determined by the courts. The main reason for the judicial intervention is that the parliamentary privileges are not codified by any law in India.

The privileges of the Houses are subjected to the laws made by the appropriate legislatures and other provisions of the constitution. The powers conferred on the Houses by the Articles 105 and 194 do not include all the powers of a court. For instance, the Houses have the power to punish any person ...

for the breach of privileges or contempt of the House, but such power is only a quasi-judicial power. It will not constitute a complete judicial power on the House. Similarly, the House cannot decide any election dispute.

Further, the Supreme Court in the Presidential reference as a sequel to the Keshav Singh case ruled that 'the notwithstanding a general warrant issued by the Assembly, the courts could examine the legality of the committal in proper proceedings'.<sup>[5]</sup> The court ruled that the scope of the privileges of the House is to be determined within Articles 32, 211 and 226. The court upheld the orders of the Allahabad High Court.

Similarly, in the Pandit M. S. M. Sharma's case the court ruled that in case there is a conflict between fundamental rights and parliamentary privileges then the fundamental rights prevail. The privileges of the Houses cannot override the fundamental rights. Hence, it is clear that the privileges of the Houses are not absolute and are subjected to judicial review with respect to their scope and operation.

### OFFICERS OF PARLIAMENT

Articles 89 and 93 provide for the officers of the Parliament. Article 89 deals with the provisions relating to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha. Article 93 provides for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha.

### Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha

Article 89 provides that the Vice-President<sup>(6)</sup> of India shall be *ex officio* Chairman of the Council of States. One of the members of Rajya Sabha is chosen as the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha. In case a vacancy in the office of Deputy Chairman occurred due to resignation, removal, or death or any other reason, then the Council shall choose another member to be Deputy Chairman.

The Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha will hold office until he is the member of the House and if he ceases to be a member of the House, then the office falls vacant. The Deputy Chairman may resign by writing under his hand addressed to the Chairman.

The Deputy Chairman is removed from office by a resolution of the Council passed by a 'majority of all the then members of the House'. However, when a resolution for his removal of the Deputy Chairman is being considered, he shall not preside over the meeting.

#### Majority of All the then Members of the House

Effective Strength of the House = Total Strength of the House – Vacancy

Majority of all the then members = Majority of hte Effective Strength

The Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha will discharge the duties and functions of the Chairman of Rajya Sabha when the office of the Chairman is vacant or when the Vice-President is acting as President. If the office of Deputy Chairman is also vacant, the President may appoint member of the Council of States to discharge the functions of the Chairman.

<sup>5</sup> The Allahabad High Court admitted a petition for Habeas Corpus and grated bail to Keshav Singh who was detained for the contempt of House ordered by the U.P. State Legislative Assembly. Reacting to this order by the court, the UP Assembly ordered that the two judges who granted bail to be brought to the custody of the House and explain why should they not be punished for the contempt of the House. This resulted in a constitutional crisis and the President referred the case to the opinion of the Supreme Court under Article 143.

<sup>6</sup> For details refer Union Executive Chapter.

When the Chairman is absent from the sitting of the Council the Deputy Chairman will act as Chairman. If he is also absent any other person as determined by the rules of procedures of the House will act as Chairman. Under the rules of procedures, the Chairman will nominate one of the six members of the panel of Vice-Chairmen to preside over the House when both Chairman and the Deputy Chairman are absent.

## Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha

Article 93 provides for the office of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha are elected by the members of Lok Sabha. In case of any vacancy occurring in the office of Speaker and Deputy Speaker, then the House will elect two more members of the House as Speaker and Deputy Speaker.

## Term of Office

#### **Powers of the Speaker**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Bring out the powers and responsibilities attached to the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. *IAS MAINS GS POLITY (2010)*

The Speaker is the Chief Officer of the Lok Sabha. There is separate secretarial staff popularly known as the Lok Sabha Secretariat, to assist him. (Article 98)

The Speaker presides over all the meetings of the House and the joint sitting of the Houses under Article 108. He is responsible for upholding the dignity and the privileges of the House.

When a point of order is raised or any question involving the interpretation of the rules and the precedents of Lok Sabha is raised the Speaker has to interpret the rule and give his ruling. The rulings given by a previous Speaker are regarded as precedents and are generally followed. The Speaker's decision is final.

It is the responsibility of the Speaker to ensure the presence of the quorum for any meeting of the House. The quorum to constitute a meeting of the Lok Sabha is one-ten of the total number of members. If the quorum is not complete it is the duty of the Speaker to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.

When a Money Bill is transmitted to Rajya Sabha after being passed by the Lok Sabha the Speaker makes an endorsement on the bill to certify that it is a Money Bill. If any question arises as to whether a bill is a Money Bill or not the Speaker's decision is final ((Article 110 (3)).

He again certifies the Money Bill when it is presented to the President for assent. On the question whether a bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker is final. If a bill contains an endorsement that it is a Money Bill then all those provisions which are applicable to Money Bill will apply to it.

### PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES

The legislative procedures include the procedures for:

- President's address
- Zero Hour
- Questions
- Legislative motions
- Bills

## President's Address

The first session every year begins with the President's address under Article 87. The first session every year is the budget session and it begins with the President's Address. The President exercises the right with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

President's address is a statement of policy of the government. Therefore, the address is drafted by the government and the President reads it out on the floor of the House. 'It contains a review of the activities and achievements of the government during the previous year and sets out the policies which it wishes to pursue with regard to important internal and international problems'.[7]

After the President's address the House debates on the points of the address. During the debates the members are permitted to ventilate their grievance that is, the members are permitted to criticize the government and its policies.

Subsequent to the discussion a Motion to Thank the President is moved. Motion of Thanks moved by a member and seconded by another member. For the discussion on Motion of Thanks, three or four days are allotted. The discussion on the Motion of Thanks is concluded by the reply of the Prime Minister or any other minister.

<sup>7</sup> Parliamentary Procedure: Abstract Series

**Amendment to the Motion:** Amendments to motion may be moved after the President has delivered the address. The amendments may refer to matters contained in the address as well as to matters which, in the opinion of the member, the address has failed to mention.

Usually any amendment to the motion is avoided by the government. However, amendments to the motion have been moved and carried two successive years—2016 and 2017. In 2016, the amendment was moved as the address did not mention about black money. In 2017, the amendment was moved to as the address 'did not commit support to rights of all citizens to contest panchayat elections in the backdrop of new laws in Rajasthan and Haryana where matriculation has been fixed as the eligibility criteria for contesting polls'.[8] In the past there have been three occasions in which amendments to the motion had been moved.

## Zero Hour

The second hour of the Parliament between 12 noon and 1 p.m. is known as Zero Hour. Since the time 12 noon coincides with 00.00 hours on a digital clock at midnight. The term was coined by the press. It is an innovation of Indian Parliament. It is not a practice in the English Parliament. Zero Hour is not provided in the rules of Parliament. It is practised as a convention since 1963.

The members of Parliament wanted to have a mechanism for raising a matter of urgent public importance. Although the short notice question was available it was found to be inadequate to raise matters of urgent public importance because the questions are to be submitted five days in advance. In the Zero Hour, the members are allowed to raise any matter of urgent public importance even if it is not found in the day's agenda.

However, the mechanism suffers from certain weaknesses there is no proper procedure for raising any matter. Hence, it is used to raise maters of political importance than of public importance.

# Parliamentary Questions[9]

The first hour of Parliament every day is allotted for the members to raise questions and get the answers from the ministers. To be raised in the Parliament any member has to submit the questions 15 days in advance. There are four types of questions namely:

- (i) Starred questions
- (ii) Unstarred questions
- (iii) Short notice questions
- (iv) Questions to private members

**Starred Questions:** A starred question is one to which a member desires an oral answer from the Minister in the House and is required to be distinguished by the member with an asterisk. Answer to such a question may be followed by supplementary questions by members.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Distinguish between a starred question and unstarred one asked in the Parliament.

*IAS MAINS (2008)*

<sup>8</sup> News report Indian Express: March 10, 2017, 'Rajya Sabha passes amendment to motion of thanks: Opposition stands up to be counted'

<sup>9</sup> Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.

**Unstarred Question:** An unstarred question is one to which written answer is desired by the member and is deemed to be laid on the table of the House by Minister. Thus, it is not called for oral answer in the House and no supplementary question can be asked thereon.

#### **Connect**

Apart from other rules applicable to ordinary questions, the short notice questions are subjected to two additional criteria:Its subject matter must be urgent.The minister concerned should agree to answer it. However, even if the minister concerned agrees to answer a short notice question, the Speaker has the power to admit the question if he is of opinion that the question is not of an urgent nature.

Source: Rules of Procedures: Lok Sabha

**Short Notice Question:** A member may give a notice of question on a matter of public importance and of urgent character for oral answer at a notice less than ten days. Such a question is known as 'Short Notice Question'.

**Questions to Private Members:** A question may also be addressed to a private member, provided that the subject matter of the question relates to some bill, Resolution or other matter connected with the business of the House for which that member is responsible. The procedure in regard to such questions is same as that followed in the case of questions addressed to a minister with such variations as the Speaker may consider necessary.

**Questions: Analysis:** Parliamentary questions are considered to be an effective control of the Parliament because when the matter is raised in the House it imposes an obligation on the minister. British Prime Minster Clement Atlee said, 'Questions are a powerful tool that makes the entire administration to stand on toes'. The questions are raised focussing on the failures of the government. However, questions as tool of control suffer from certain weaknesses:

- The 15 days advance notice to be given to raise a question is too long a period that the matter may lose its relevance.
- For certain questions the government has the immunity of not answering any question in the interest of the nation.
- Similarly, a minister can also refuse to answer a question. But this privilege has to be utilized rarely.
- In certain cases, the minister may ask for time to prepare answers to questions and when allotted could play delay tactics.
- The one hour time allotted for question is seriously limited that only few questions could be asked.

### Legislative Motions

**Calling Attention Motion:** A Calling Attention Motion is moved by a member with the prior permission of the Speaker. By this the member draws the attention of a minister to a matter of urgent public importance and the minister may make a brief statement on the matter. The statement of the minister is like a white paper which may be used by the opposition to embarrass the government on a future date.

However, the minister may ask for time to make a statement on later date which might dilute the importance of the matter. Similarly, there is a possibility that the minister may be changed in case of a reshuffling of the Council of Minister.
**Censure Motion:** It is a motion moved by the members against an individual minister or a group of ministers or the entire Council of Ministers. The objective is to express the unhappiness of the House upon the minister(s). However, even if such a censure motion is carried it is not necessary for the concerned minister(s) need not resign or not to be dismissed. It is to provide for a moral impact and as deterrence. But it does not have any serious impact in practice.

**Adjournment Motion[10]:** The adjournment motion is an extraordinary procedure. If admitted, the normal business of the House is adjourned or set aside and the matter is taken for discussion.

The primary object of an adjournment motion is to draw the attention of the House to a matter of urgent public importance having serious consequences and with regard to which a motion or a resolution with proper notice will be too late. The motion is allowed only if the following conditions are fulfilled:

- The matter raised is definite. The motion is not permitted on any allegations.
- The matter must be of public importance.
- The matter must be of urgent nature.
- It should not be pointed against any individual.
- It does not raise a question of privilege.

An adjournment motion is to be carried by a majority of total membership of the House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting. Therefore, if an adjournment motion is carried against the government in the Lok Sabha, it amounts to a loss of confidence of the government. It means that if subsequently, a no-confidence motion is moved the government would fail to defend itself.

### No-Confidence Motion

A no-confidence motion is moved by the opposition to express the loss of confidence of the House on the Council of Ministers. It can be moved only in the Lok Sabha because Article 75 of the constitution provides that the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

When permitted the motion is given precedence over other agenda of the House and taken up for consideration immediately. The members criticize the government and its functioning. The ministers reply to the points raised by the members of the opposition and the Prime Minister finally makes his statement. Then the motion is subjected to voting.

| <b>Confidence Vote</b>              | <b>No-Confidence Motion</b>           |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Moved by the government.            | Moved by the opposition.              |
| If carried the government survives. | If carried the government falls.      |
| Practised as a convention.          | Provided in the rules.                |
| No ground is required for moving.   | Can be moved only on specific grounds |

The motion needs to be carried by a majority of total membership of the House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the House. If the motion is carried then the Council of Ministers is said to have lost the majority support of the House and hence, must resign. In case the Council of Ministers did not resign, then the President has the power to dismiss the Council.

Once moved and not carried against the government the motion can be moved only after a time period of six months.

<sup>10</sup> Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.

**Confidence Vote:** It is moved by the Council of Ministers unlike the no-confidence motion which is moved by the opposition. It is not provided in the rules of the Parliament but is practised as a convention. It is sometimes known as 'trust vote'.

It is a process of the Council of Ministers establishing the confidence of the majority of the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister moves the resolution to seek the support of the House for his government.

The process is not found in the rules of procedures of the House and the rules governing the no-confidence motion is applied to the confidence vote. Similarly, it has to be carried by a special majority as the no-confidence motion. If carried, then the government survives.

# Cut Motions

Cut motions are moved as part the budgetary process. The cut motions are moved when the demands for grants are discussed in order to reduce the grant. The cut motions are an expression of the disagreement or dissent with the government. It has a censure value. Whenever a member proposes to move a cut motion the government immediately takes steps to settle the grievances of the member and prevents the motion. There are three types of cut motions namely:

- (i) Disapproval of policy cut motion
- (ii) Token cut motion
- (iii) Economy cut motion

**Disapproval of Policy Cut Motion:** It is commonly known as policy cut. It seeks to reduce the amount of a demand to rupee one. It implies that the principle behind the expenditure is disapproved. This in turn means that the policy for which the demand is made is disapproved.

**Token Cut Motion:** It is a symbolic motion. It is moved to express and ventilate the grievances of a member and to draw the attention of the House and the government towards a matter. It seeks to reduce the demand by rupees one hundred.Economy Cut Motion

It aims at bringing about economy to the government expenditure. It seeks to reduce the expenditure by a specified amount so that the expenditure will not be wasteful.

#### Bills

There are three types of bills in the Indian Parliament namely, Ordinary Bills, Financial Bills and the Constitutional Amendment Bills. The provisions relating to the introduction of the bill is provided in Article 107.

**Passage of Ordinary Bills:** A bill is a statute in the draft form and cannot become law unless it has received the approval of both the Houses of Parliament and the assent of the President of India.

The process of law making begins with the introduction of a bill in either House of Parliament. A bill can be introduced either by a minister or a member other than a minister. If it is introduced by a minister it is known as a Government Bill. In case it is introduced by a member other a minister then it is known as a Private Member's Bill.

Such bills are known as Ordinary Bills. An Ordinary Bill can be introduced in either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. It does not require the prior sanction of the President.

A minister who desires to introduce a bill has to give seven days' notice in writing of one's intention to move for leave to introduce the bill. The Speaker allocates time for the introduction of the bill.

**First Reading:** When permitted the bill is introduced and undergoes three readings in each House before it is submitted to the President for assent. The minister/member in-charge of the bill introduces a motion for leave, a motion seeking the permission of the House. When the motion is adopted the bill is introduced in the House. This is known as the first reading.

After that, the bill is referred to the 'Departmentally Related Standing Committees'. The committee considers the bill in detail and makes a report to the House.

**Second Reading:** The second reading of the bill consists of two stages. The first stage constitutes discussion on the principles of the bill and its provisions generally on any of the following motions, that the bill be taken into consideration.  $(11)$ 

The second stage of the second reading consists of clause-by-clause consideration of the bill, as introduced in Lok Sabha or as reported by Departmentally Related Standing Committee. The discussion takes place on each clause of the bill based on the report of the committee. Amendments can be moved to the bill at this stage. Each amendment and each clause is put to the vote of the House. The amendments become part of the bill if they are accepted by a majority of members present and voting, this is known as 'ordinary majority' or 'simple majority'.

**Third Reading:** The third reading refers to the discussion on the motion that the bill or the bill, as amended, be passed. At this stage, debate is confined to arguments either in support or rejection of the bill without referring to the details thereof further than is necessary for the purpose of arguments. Then the motion is carried by the required majority and the bill is passed. After this the bill is transmitted to the second House where the bill undergoes the same three readings and passed. Once passed by both the Houses the bill is presented to the President for his assent and upon his assent the bill becomes a law.

**Deadlock Over the Bills:** When a bill is passed in one House, it is transmitted to the second House. If the second House also passes the bill it will become a law after the President assents to the bill. However, the second House may:

- (a) Rejects the bill or;
- (b) Returns the bill with recommendations for amendments to the bill and the amendments are not agreeable to the first House or;
- (c) Retains the bill with itself without taking any action on the bill for a period of more than six months. If any of the above situations arises then a deadlock between the two Houses of the Parliament is said to have arisen. In order to resolve the deadlock between the two Houses over an Ordinary Bill the constitution provides for the joint sitting of the two Houses.

#### **Joint Sitting**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

When is the device of joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament not available?

*IAS MAINS (2001)*

The Indian Constitution has provisions for holding joint session of the two Houses of the Parliament. Enumerate the occasions when this would normally happen and also the occasions when it cannot, with reasons thereof. *IAS MAINS (2017)*

Who presides over the joint session of the two Houses of the Indian Parliament over a non-money bill? *IAS MAINS (1999)*

**RA 80** 

<sup>11</sup> Before the practice of the Departmentally Related Standing Committee was introduced, at this stage the Bill could be referred to a Select Committee of the House or a Joint Parliamentary Committee.

Article 108 provides for the joint sitting of the two Houses to resolve the deadlock between the two Houses. The power to convene the joint sitting is vested in the President. In case of a deadlock the President summons the joint sitting.

In case the President, had declared his intention to summon a joint sitting to resolve the deadlock between the Houses over a bill, then the bill shall not lapse even if the Lok Sabha is dissolved.

The joint sitting is presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. If he is absent then the Deputy Speaker shall preside over the sitting. If he is also absent the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha will preside. In case he is also absent or unable to preside over, then the senior-most member by age in the sitting shall preside over.  $(12)$ In the joint sitting the decision shall be taken by the majority of the members of the sitting present and voting.

Joint sitting is not permitted in case of a Money Bill and Constitution Amendment Bill.

In the joint sitting only, such points of disagreement between the Houses is discussed and no other point is permitted to be taken for discussion. Also, no amendment is to the bill is permitted. However, certain amendments may be permitted by the Presiding Officer and his decision in that regard is final.

#### **Lapsing of Bills**

- (a) According to Article 107 (3), a bill will not lapse on the prorogation of the House.
- (b) A bill that originated and is pending in the Lok Sabha will lapse if the House is dissolved.
- (c) A bill that originated in the Lok Sabha and is pending in the Rajya Sabha after being passed by the Lok Sabha, will lapse if the House is dissolved. In case a joint sitting is to be summoned then the bill will not lapse.
- (d) A bill that originated and pending in the Rajya Sabha will not lapse on the dissolution of Lok Sabha.

**Financial Bills:** Financial Bills are those bills which deal with financial matters. There are three types of financial bills namely:

- (i) Money Bills
- (ii) Financial Bills Class I
- (iii) Financial Bills Class II

#### **Money Bills**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Define Money bill. Discuss how it is passed in the Parliament. *IAS MAINS (2004)* 

A Money Bill is defined by Article 110. Any bill that deals with all or any of the matters in Articles 110 (1) (a) to (f) is known as a Money Bill. Such matters are:

- (a) The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax.
- (b) The regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of any guarantee by the Government of India, or the amendment of the law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the Government of India.
- (c) The custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal of moneys from any such fund.

<sup>12</sup> Article 118(4) provides that in the absence of the Speaker the siting shall be presided over by such a person as may be determined by the rules of procedures of the Parliament.

- (d) The appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India.
- (e) The declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the increasing of the amount of any such expenditure.
- (f) The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the public account of India or the custody or issue of such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of a State.

**Passage of Money Bills:** Passage of Money Bill is governed by Articles 109 and 117. According to Article 117 (1), a Money Bill can be introduced in the Parliament only on the previous recommendation of the President.

A Money Bill can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha. It cannot be introduced in the Rajya Sabha. This is because the Rajya Sabha does not have any financial powers. Since Rajya Sabha is a federal House and is a representative House of the States the House is not conferred with any financial powers. If the House had financial powers it may hold the union government finance to ransom with political motive.

Once the Money Bill is passed in the Lok Sabha, the bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha can retain the bill for a period of 14 days. Before the expiry of 14 days Rajya Sabha has to return the bill to Lok Sabha with its views or recommendations. It is the discretion of the Lok Sabha to either accept or to reject the recommendations. Then the bill is deemed to have passed by the Parliament and presented to the President for his assent.

Similarly, if 14 days expired after the Money Bill being transmitted to Rajya Sabha and the House did not return the bill then, the bill is deemed to have been passed in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha and is presented to the President for his assent.

When a Money Bill is presented to the President for his assent, he may declare that he gives his assent or reject the bill and veto the bill. But he cannot return the bill for reconsideration of the House.

**Money Bill and Veto Power:** The President enjoys absolute veto power in case of a Money Bill of the Union Parliament or the state legislature. But he does not enjoy suspensive veto over a Money Bill—both Union and States.

The suspensive veto power is not vested in the President with respect to a Money Bill because the bill is introduced only with his previous recommendation. Hence, in case of any clarification needed, he has to get it at the time of its introduction.

Further the bill deals with the revenue and expenditure of the government and if the bill is not assented to immediately, it could bring the government to a grinding halt for want of finance. To avoid such circumstances the President is not vested with the veto power over the bill.

However, in case of any eventuality that the government had to recall a money bill then, the Council of Ministers may advice the President to veto the bill. Otherwise it would require enacting another law to repeal or nullify the law.

**Passage of Financial Bills:** A bill containing the provisions of money bill but not solely dealing with those matters and contains other matters also is known as a Class I Financial Bill. A Class I Financial Bill shares two features in common with Money Bills namely:

- (a) The bill cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha and can be introduced only in Lok Sabha.
- (b) The bill can be introduced only with the previous recommendation of the President.

For all other purposes the bill is an ordinary bill. The bill being an Ordinary Bill, both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha enjoy equal powers. Therefore, in case of any deadlock between the two Houses over the bill even joint sitting is permitted.

A bill which if enacted and made a law would involve expenditure from the consolidated fund of India is known as Class II Financial Bill. A Class II Financial Bill shall be taken for consideration of the House of Parliament only on the recommendation of the President Article 117 (3). Otherwise for the purpose of passage in the Parliament, the bill is an Ordinary Bill.

Passage of Constitutional Amendment Bills is dealt with in a separate chapter on amendment.

## COMMITTEES OF PARLIAMENT

There are two types of parliamentary Committees namely 'Standing Committees and *Ad hoc* Committees'. Standing Committees are permanent committees and they are constituted periodically, say every year, in accordance with law. Standing committees function continuously. *Ad hoc* Committees are constituted for a specific purpose whenever it is deemed necessary. The Departmentally Related Standing Committees, Public Accounts Committee, Estimates Committee and Committee on Public Undertakings are Standing Committees.

# Public Accounts Committee (PAC)

PAC was first set-up on the recommendations of the Montagu–Chelmsford Committee in 1921. PAC has 22 members, 15 from Lok Sabha and 7 from Rajya Sabha. The members are elected by the respective Houses from among its members. They are elected by a system of proportional representation system by means of a single transferable vote.

The Speaker appoints the Chairman of the PAC from amongst the members of the Committee from Lok Sabha. If the Speaker or Deputy Speaker is a member of the PAC, he will be the Chairman of PAC.

Functions of the Committee: The committee has the powers to scrutinize the appropriation accounts and the audit report of the CAGI. It has the power to authorize the excess grants. The committee, while scrutinizing the CAGI report, needs to satisfy itself:

- (a) Whether the moneys shown in the accounts as having been disbursed were legally available for, and applicable to, the service or purpose to which they have been applied or charged.
- (b) Whether the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it.
- (c) Whether every re-appropriation has been made in accordance with the provisions made in this behalf under rules framed by competent authority.
- (d) Whether statement of accounts showing the income and expenditure of state corporations, trading and manufacturing schemes, concerns and projects together with the balance sheets and statements of profit and loss accounts.

### Estimates Committee

The Estimates Committee was constituted for the first time in 1950. It consists of 30 members. All the members belong to Lok Sabha and are elected every year by the Lok Sabha from amongst its members. Since Rajya Sabha does not have financial powers vested by the Constitution the members of the House do not have representation in the committee.

A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee and if a member after selection to the committee is appointed a minister, the member ceases to be a member of the committee from the date of such appointment. Chairperson of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members.

**Functions of the Committee:** The functions of the Committee on Estimates are:

- (a) To report what economies, improvements in organization, efficiency or administrative reform, consistent with the policy underlying the estimates may be affected.
- (b) To suggest alternative policies in order to bring about efficiency and economy in administration.

- (c) To examine whether the money is well laid out within the limits of the policy implied in the estimates.
- (d) To suggest the form in which the estimates shall be presented to Parliament. The committee does not exercise its functions in relation to such Public Undertakings as are allotted to the Committee on Public.

#### Committee on Public Undertakings

The Committee on Public Undertakings is a Parliamentary Committee consists of 22 members. Fifteen members are elected by the Lok Sabha every year from amongst its members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Seven members are nominated by Rajya Sabha for being associated with the Committee. The Chairman is appointed by the Speaker from amongst the members of the Committee.

**Functions of the Committee:** The functions of the committee on Public Undertakings are:

- (b) To examine the reports, if any, of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on the Public Undertakings.
- (c) To examine, in the context of the autonomy and efficiency of the Public Undertakings whether the affairs of the Public Undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business principles and prudent commercial practices.
- (d) To exercise such other functions vested in the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee in relation to the Public Undertakings as are not covered by clauses (a), (b) and (c) above and as may be allotted to the Committee by the Speaker from time-to-time.
