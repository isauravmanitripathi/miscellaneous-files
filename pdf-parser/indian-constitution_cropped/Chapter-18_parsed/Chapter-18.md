# INTRODUCTION

Union territories are those territories that are under the direct administrative control of the union government. As given in Article 366 (30), 'Union territory means any union territory specified in the First Schedule and includes any other territory comprised within the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule'.

The original constitution had three categories of states namely Part A, Part B and Part C states. There were 10 Part C states which were administered by the President through a Chief Commissioner. The Constitution (7th Amendment) Act, 1956, substituted the Part C states as 'Union Territories'. Later few states were made as full-fledged states while others still continue as union territories. Now there are seven Union Territories namely Delhi, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Puducherry and Chandigarh.

#### Associate Members

Under the Union Territories Act, 1963, the Delimitation Commission takes the assistance of the members of Parliament. Such members are known as the associate members of the Commission

Such territories are placed under the administration of the union government due to certain reasons:

- 1. The territories are large in size but not larger to be established as a state. Also, they may not have capability to generate enough resources for their administration.
- 2. Certain territories are strategically important and need to be administered by the union government. Example is Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
- 3. Certain territories are ecologically sensitive and so are placed under the union government. Example is Lakshadweep.

- 4. Some of the territories were under the rule of a colonial master other than British. For instance, Puducherry was under the French, Goa, Daman, Diu and Nagar Haveli were ruled by the Portuguese. They got integrated with India on different dates and under different legal arrangement.
- 5. Chandigarh is administered as a union territory as it serves the capital of both Punjab and Haryana.

Article 239 provides the President shall administer these territories by appointing an administrator. The designation of such administrator may be specified by the President. The administrators appointed for union territory of Puducherry and National Capital Territory are known as Lieutenant Governor. The Governor of Punjab concurrently holds the charge of administrator of Chandigarh also.

If the office of the administrator of a union territory falls vacant then the Governor of a state may be appointed as the administrator of an adjoining union territory. When appointed so, the Governor shall act independently and without the advice of the Council of Ministers. He has to act according to the direction of the President.

#### UNION TERRITORY OF PUDUCHERRY

Article 239A empowers the Parliament to create legislatures and Council of Ministers for the union territories. Article 239A was inserted by the Constitution (14th Amendment) Act, 1956. The provision enables the Parliament to create legislatures and Council of Ministers for Puducherry. When such a law is enacted it is not deemed to be an amendment for the purpose of Article 368.

Subsequently, in the year 1963, the Parliament enacted the Government of Union Territories Act and created the Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers for Puducherry.

#### Ordinance Making Power

Article 239B provides for the ordinance making power with respect to Puducherry when the legislature is in recess. The power is vested in the Lieutenant Governor. The Governor shall exercise the power only upon the instruction of the President.

However, if the legislature is suspended or dissolved the Lieutenant Governor shall not promulgate any ordinance. In effect, the Lieutenant Governor can promulgate ordinances only:

- (i) With the instruction of the President.
- (ii) The legislature is in recess.

Any such ordinance promulgated will have the validity of a law enacted by the Assembly. A bill to replace the ordinance must be laid in the Assembly within six weeks from the date of reassembly of the House. Otherwise the ordinance will lapse.

TABLE 18.1 Ordinance Making Power State vs Union Territories

# NATIONAL CAPITAL TERRITORY (NCT)

The Constitution (69th Amendment) Act inserted Article 239AA and enacted the Special Provision for Delhi. Since 1991 the union territory of Delhi is established as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Since then the administrator appointed for Delhi under Article 239 is known as the Lieutenant Governor for Delhi.

Article 239AA also provides for the Legislative Assembly of Delhi with members elected from the territorial constituencies. The strength of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi and the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Caste are to be regulated by the Law of the Parliament. The provisions of election under Articles 324 to 327 will apply to NCT as similar to application of the provisions to the Legislative Assemblies of the states.

However, with respect the NCT, the powers relating to the following shall be vested in the Parliament:

- To regulate the voting rights under Article 326.
- The preparation of electoral rolls, the delimitation of constituencies.
- Deciding on the jurisdiction of the courts with respect to elections.

#### Smallest and Largest!!!

- Lakshadweep which is of 32 sq. km area is the smallest UT.
- Mahe, a district in Puducherry is the smallest district in India.
- Andaman and Nicobar Islands is the largest UT.

The Legislative Assembly of NCT has the power to enact laws with respect to the region on all matters in the State List of Schedule VII. But the Assembly does not have the powers to legislate on the following matters namely:

- 1. Public order (but not including the use of any naval, military or air force or any other armed force of the Union or of any other force subjected to the control of the Union or of any contingent or unit thereof in aid of the civil power).
- 2. Police (including railway and village police) subjected to the provisions of entry 2A of List I.
- 3. Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents; transfer and alienation of agricultural land; land improvement and agricultural loans; colonization.

#### Do You Know?

- Manipur was made a UT in 1956 and later in 1972 it was made a state.
- • Arunachal Pradesh was made a UT in 1972 and was upgraded as a state in 1987.
- • Mizoram was a district in Assam until 1972. In 1972 it was made a UT and was upgraded to a state in 1987.

Similarly, the Assembly does not have the power to legislate with respect to the following if such law is relating to the above-mentioned three subjects:

- 1. Offences against laws with respect to any of the matters in this list.
- 2. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list.
- 3. Fees in respect of any of the matters in this list, but not including fees taken in any court.

However, if a law made the Legislative Assembly of NCT conflicts with a law made by the Parliament on that matter, then the law of the Parliament shall prevail over the law made by the Legislative Assembly of NCT. In case the President had granted his assent to a law made by the Delhi Assembly on being reserved for his consideration, then the law shall prevail over the law made by the Parliament. However, the Parliament has the power to override this and make law for the NCT.

The power to maintain law and order is a state subject, but with respect to NCT it is vested in the union government. In pursuance of this the Delhi Police is established under the Special Police Establishment Act, 1944. The reason behind this are:

- It is a usual practice around the world to vest the power to maintain the law and order in the central Government. Delhi being the capital of India the power is vested in the Union government.
- All important institutions like the Parliament, diplomatic enclaves and the residences of all dignitaries like the President are located in Delhi. Thus, the security of Delhi is strategically important. It cannot be left to the mercy of any state government.
- Since the union government is not granted with its own forces, Delhi Police is established as a special force. Pressing the Central Armed Reserved Police Force or the Armed Forces would be disproportionate to the task.

#### Council of Ministers of Delhi

Article 239AA (4) provides for a Council of Ministers for Delhi. The strength of the Council shall be ten per cent of the total membership of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. The Chief Minister of NCT is appointed by the President. Other Ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Chief Minister has the discretion in this regard. The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly.

The Council of Ministers will 'aid and advice' the Lieutenant Governor in exercise of his functions in all matters except in the exercise of his discretionary powers. In case of a difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Council, he shall refer the matter to the President and act according to the direction of the President. When the direction from the President is pending, the Lieutenant Governor can take any action in his discretion if any 'urgency' circumstance occurred.

#### Consolidated Fund

- • The Consolidated Fund of the UTs is established by the notification of the Central Government under the Government of UTs Act, 1963.
- • Custody of Consolidated Fund, payment of moneys into the fund, withdrawal of moneys and all other matters shall be regulated by rules made by the administrator with the approval of the President.

#### Breakdown of Constitutional Machinery: Article 239 AB

The President has the power to suspend the operation of the provisions of Article 239AA and all or any law made under the article if:

- He is satisfied that the administration of NCT cannot be carried in accordance with the constitution or;
- For the proper administration of NCT.

The presidential satisfaction is subjected to the 'report of the Lieutenant Governor' or 'otherwise'. Similar to Article 356, this provision is also subjected to judicial review.

# Anomalies of 69th Amendment

The Constitution (69th Amendment) Act suffers from certain anomalies which are as follows:

- (a) Article 239AA expressly mentions that the administrator of the NCT be known as Lieutenant Governor. But, any special reason for the status is not provided.
- (b) The difference between the administrators of other UTs and the Lieutenant Governor in respect of their status and powers are also not defined.
- (c) Similarly, like the Governor of any state, the Lieutenant Governor also has his Council of Ministers to 'aid and advice' him. But his powers are not defined.
- (d) Article 239AA mentions that the Lieutenant Governor has discretionary powers but those powers are not defined and remain ambiguous.
- (e) With respect to the ordinance making powers the Lieutenant Governor must act according to the direction of the President. However, this potentially can be a point of dispute if there was a difference of opinion between the Council of Ministers and the President in this regard. The President is to act according to the advice of the union Council of Ministers.

# ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER UNION TERRITORIES

Article 240 provides for the administration of the union territories of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu. The President has the power to 'make regulations for the peace, progress and good government' of these union territory.

With respect to Puducherry, the President does not have the power to 'make regulations for the peace, progress and good government' during when the legislature of the Puducherry remains alive. He shall have the power only when the legislature is suspended or dissolved. If the President makes any such resolution it may repeal or amend any act made by the Parliament.

# HIGH COURTS FOR UNION TERRITORIES

According to Article 241, the Parliament has the power to constitute a high court for a union territory by enacting a law. Similarly, it can also extend the jurisdiction of any high court over the union territory.

# ALTERING THE NAMES, AREAS OR BOUNDARIES

The procedure for the altering the names, areas or boundaries of a union territory is same for the states. According to the explanation given in Article 3, same procedure is applicable to the union territories also.
