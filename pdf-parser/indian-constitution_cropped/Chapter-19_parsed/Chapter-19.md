# EVOLUTION AND GROWTH

The concept of local self-government has been evolving in India ever since the *Vedic* period. In the age of *Janapadas*, the administration was conducted by an assembly consisting of local chieftains. In the post Mauryan republics of Malavas and the Kshudrakas, the decisions were taken by *sabhas*. In the Chola dynasty, the village council, together with its subcommittees and wards, played an important part in administration like tax assessment and revenue collection, arbitrated disputes and managed social affairs. They had virtual ownership of village wasteland and took part in public development works like irrigation.

The present structure of local self-government institutions has been moulded since 1688, when the British established Municipal Corporation at Madras for the first time. In 1872, Lord Mayo introduced elected representatives for these municipalities. The Minto–Morley Reforms, 1909 and the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, 1919 widened the participation of people in the governing process. Also, the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms listed local self-government as a transferred subject and provincial governments were entrusted with the responsibility of enabling local self-government at all levels. This arrangement continued till the country's independence in 1947 and thereafter till the late 1950s.

## Local Self-government in Independent India

In the independent Constitution of India, the *Panchayat i Raj* Institutions (PRI) have found place in the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). Article 40 provides that, the State shall take steps to organize village *Panchayats* and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.

In compliance with Article 40, the Community Development Programme was launched in 1952 to secure socio-economic transformation of village life through people's own democratic and cooperative organizations with the government providing technical services, supply and credit.

#### Do You Know?

In the original constitution *Panchayats* were not given importance because:

- Fully decentralized local self-government was considered a threat to national unity.
- Casteism in rural areas would kill the purpose of local self-government.

In 1956, the Second Five-Year Plan recommended that the village *Panchayats* should be organically linked with popular organizations at higher levels and in stages the democratic body should take over the entire general administration and development of the district.

In 1957, Government of India appointed a committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Balwantrai Mehta which recommended that:

- Administrative decentralization for effective implementation of the development programmes and the decentralized administrative system to be placed under the control of local bodies.
- The *Panchayat samiti* has to be equipped with sources of income.
- Reservation for SC/ST and women through co-option.
- In order to ensure coordination, a *Zila Parishad* has to be formed at the district level as an advisory body.

#### Is 73rd Amendment an Encroachment on State List?

- No. It is not. 73rd amendment provides only for the enabling provisions.
- It does not create a complete PRI structure in the States.
- It just provides for uniformity throughout the country.
- It is an attempt to stop political playing with PRI institutions.

By the 1960s, *Gram Panchayats* covered 90% of the rural population of India. Although a number of *Panchayat* structures were set-up in different States at all the three tiers, they had limited powers and resources. However, the essential idea that all developmental activity should flow only through the block *Panchayat samitis* lost ground. *Panchayati Raj* elections were postponed indefinitely and flow of funds for block development was reduced to a trickle.

In 1977, government formed a committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Asoka Mehta to go into the working of PRI. The Asoka Mehta Committee was of the view that the democratic process could not stop at the state level.

Although a number of committees were formed between 1978 and 1986 to look into various aspects of strengthening the local self-government institutions such as the committees under Shri C. H. Hanumantha Rao, Shri G. V. K. Rao and Shri L. M. Singhvi, only minor suggestions were made for any change in the ideas/structures proposed by the Asoka Mehta Committee.

The next landmark in decentralized governance occurred with the 64th and 65th Constitutional Amendment Bills introduced in July 1989. The basic provisions of the bills were:

- It should be mandatory for all States to set-up PRIs/ULBs.
- The elections to be conducted by the Election Commission.

- Tenure of *Panchayats*/ULBs to be five years and, if dissolved before time, fresh elections should be held within six months.
- Planning and budgeting systems be introduced at the *Panchayat* level.
- The state legislature to authorize *Panchayats*/ULBs to levy taxes/tolls and fees.

#### Article 40 Rationale

#### Article 40

Organization of village *Panchayats* The State shall take steps to organize village *Panchayats* and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.

'What is attempted to do here is to give a definite and unequivocal direction that the state shall take steps to organize *Panchayats* and shall endow them with necessary powers and authority to enable them to function as units of self-government. That the entire structure of self-government, of independence in this country should be based on organized village community life is the common factor of all the amendments tabled and that factor has been made the principle basis of this amendment.'

K. Santhanam, CAD, Volume VII

#### Rashtriya Gaurav Gram Sabha Puraskar

- • National Award instituted to incentivize to encourage *Gram Panchayats* for outstanding performance, through effective *Gram Sabhas*.
- • Main objective is to strengthen the institution of *Gram Sabha* and highlight it as the institution for decision and social audit.
- • *Gram Sabha* is a vibrant forum for promoting planned economic and social development of the villages in a transparent way.
- • *Gram Sabha* ensures direct participative democracy and offers equal opportunity to all citizens—poor, women, marginalized sections, to discuss, critically evaluate, various serious issues that affect the socio-economic development of the village.

The bill could however not be passed in the Rajya Sabha.

In 1992, after synthesizing important features of the earlier exercises on this subject, government drafted and introduced the 73rd and 74th Amendment Bills in Parliament which were passed in 1993. These introduced new Parts IX and IXA in the Indian Constitution containing Articles 243 to 243ZG. The 73rd and 74th Amendments to the constitution constitute a new chapter in the process of democratic decentralization in India.

The main provisions of the constitution relating to the *Panchayats* and the municipalities are presented in the following table in order to enable understanding in a comparative mode. The table also includes the main recommendations of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission under the relevant provisions.

### **Municipalities** Part IXA(Articles 243P–243ZG)

Recommendations **Accounting and Audit**

- of the Second ARC (a) The accounting system for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) as provided in the National Municipal Accounts Manual (NMAM) should be adopted by the State Governments.
  - (b) The financial statements and balance sheet of the urban local bodies should be audited by an auditor in the manner prescribed for audit of Government Companies under the Companies Act, 1956 with the difference that in the case of audit of these local bodies, the CAG should prescribe guidelines for empanelment of the Chartered Accountants and the selection can be made by the State governments within these guidelines.
  - (c) The audit to be done by the Local Fund Audit or the CAG in discharge of their responsibilities would be in addition to such an audit.
  - (d) The existing arrangement between the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India and the State governments with regard to providing Technical Guidance and Supervision (TGS) over maintenance of accounts and audit of PRIs and ULBs should be institutionalized by making provisions in the State laws governing local bodies.
  - (e) It should be ensured that the audit and accounting standards and formats for *Panchayats* are prepared in a way which is simple and comprehensible to the elected representatives of the PRIs.
  - (f) The independence of the Director Local Fund Audit (DLFA) or any other agency responsible for audit of accounts of local bodies should be institutionalized by making the office independent of the State administration.
  - (g) The head of this body should be appointed by the State government from a panel vetted by the CAG.
  - (h) Release of Finance Commission Grants to the local bodies may be made conditional on acceptance of arrangements regarding technical supervision of the CAG over audit of accounts of local bodies.
  - (i) Audit reports on local bodies should be placed before the state legislature and these reports should be discussed by a separate committee of the state legislature on the same lines as the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
  - (j) Access to relevant information/records to DLFA/designated authority for conducting audit or the CAG should be ensured by incorporating suitable provisions in the state laws governing local bodies.

Local government laws in<br>all States should provide for adoption of the Assembly electoral rolls for local<br>governments without any revision of names by SECs. For such a process to be<br>effective it is necessary to ensure that the voter registration and preparation<br>of electoral rolls by Election Commission of India is based on geographic<br>contiguity.

## PANCHAYATI RAJ INSTITUTIONS: A REVIEW

Over the years, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) have developed certain critical strengths, in spite of several systemic weaknesses and constraints. Post the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, the PRIs have acquired substantial legitimacy and have created participatory structures of grass roots democracy for the rural people. Consequent to the 73rd Constitutional Amendment as well as the Supreme Court's rulings, the three tier PRIs—district, block and village Panchayat are also treated as 'Government or State'. Creation of constitutional bodies like the State Election Commissions and the State Finance Commissions have also given permanency and stability to these institutions.

# PRIs: An Analysis

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

- (a) In absence of a well-educated and organized local level government system, `*Panchayats*' and '*Samitis*' have remained mainly political institutions and not effective instruments of governance. Critically discuss. *IAS MAINS (GS) (2015)*
- (b) 'The local self-government system in India has not proved to be effective instrument of governance'. Critically examine the statement and give your views to improve the situation.

*IAS MAINS (GS) 2017*

- It took years, and in some cases a decade, to even constitute local governments and hold elections, despite the constitutional mandate.
- Even when local governments are constituted and elections are held; States often postponed the subsequent elections on some pretext or other.
- There has been no linear development or evolution in respect of democratic decentralization.
- States are reluctant to effectively empower local governments. Only the bare minimum required to implement the strict letter of the constitution prevails in many States and the spirit of the constitution and principles of democracy is often ignored.
- Even mandatory provisions like the constitution of District Planning Committees and Metropolitan Planning Committees have been ignored in many States.
- Where the *Panchayats* have been constituted and elections held regularly, there is no effective devolution of powers, leading to further centralization.
- Some legislators at times tend to act as 'executives', intervening in transfers and postings, sanctioning of local bodies' contracts and tenders, crime investigation and prosecution, all of which are, therefore, often at the mercy of the local legislator. Given the compulsions of survival, the State government which depends on the goodwill and support of legislators does not usually intervene except where the constitution specifically and unambiguously directs it.

### Voluntary Provisions Under 73rd Amendment

- 1. Voting rights to the MPs and MLAs in PRIs.
- 2. Reservation to Backward Classes.
- 3. Financial powers: Taxes, levy, fees, etc.
- 4. Devolution of powers under Schedule XI.
- 5. Providing autonomy to PRIs.

## Report of the Task Force on the Panchayati Raj Jurisprudence

To build a consistent body of jurisprudence, based on more or less uniform pattern of statutes, Ministry of Panchayati Raj appointed the task force with Dr V. S. Ramadevi, Former Governor, HP and Karnataka as the Chairperson. The task force made the following recommendations:

- The five yearly patterns of the *Panchayat* elections should be regularized.
- The procedure with similar officials having similar powers with regard to the conduct of the elections, throughout the country, should be uniform.
- An election tribunal for dealing with the disputes arising out of or in connection with the election to local governments must be set-up. The election tribunal's powers should be as close to that of a 'court' under the CPC as possible, in order to avoid any litigation on the jurisdiction of the tribunal.
- The state legislature should make it clear how the majority is to be calculated. The law should define whether only the valid votes would be considered or otherwise for deciding quorum.
- Updating the electoral roll for *Panchayat* elections shall be the sole responsibility of the SEC. It has to be carefully done and the people must be educated about the importance of enrolling their names in the electoral roll.
- *Panchayats* may be given the power to suspend and remove an elected functionary by a resolution. The collector or similar official may suspend/remove a functionary, but only after a resolution has been passed by the *Panchayat*.
- Specific provisions have to be given for removal and no-confidence motion. But these two should not be bundled up.
- The executive's hold over *Panchayat* resolution and motions has to be reduced. In the alternative, the Assam model which provides for a hierarchical *Panchayat* supervision pattern may be resorted to if the State government finds it more conducive.

- Once a no-confidence motion is rejected, the next such motion can be permitted only after six months.
- Non-Party Elections: Though party politics has become institutionalized at the *Panchayat* level, the task force recommends *Panchayat* elections at all the three tiers not to be held on party basis.
  - (a) Non-party elections would be conducive to stability and development in the *Panchayat* framework.
  - (b) It would also avoid the rift between the State government and the *Panchauat* administrations, especially if different parties are in power.
- Notification of villages/delimitation of constituencies should be done during the tenure of the *Panchayat* should be announced much earlier to the elections. The power to delimit should be vested in the SEC.
- The resolutions passed by the *Panchayats* should be made non-reversible by executive authorities.
- An efficient social auditing mechanism will help to make the *Panchayats* more accountable to the people. This will also make the State government a lot more relaxed while devolving funds and functions to the *Panchayats*.
- Parallel bodies like Villages/Rural Development Committees, etc., should be abolished and every development work should be undertaken by and through *Panchayats*.
- All the welfare projects should be executed through *Panchayats*.

### Urban Local Bodies: Challenges

The specific capacity gaps identified, though varying widely across Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), can be grouped under three heads:

- (a) Inadequate skills and capacity of the present personnel at all levels.
- (b) Limited availability of personnel with adequate skill sets to execute projects in a sustainable manner.Absence of suitable institutional framework for supporting continuous skill up gradation, etc.

### Steps to be taken

- 1. Creating enabling framework for ULBs to hire persons from market and to provide funds for the purpose.
- 2. Consolidating information on available training modules, identifying individual trainers and institutions and conducting training programmes.
- 3. Induction training for key policy makers and administrators on Urban Management be encouraged at all levels.

### FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY CHARTER ON PANCHAYAT RAJ

Though States have enacted *Panchayati Raj* legislation, real devolution of powers and responsibilities so as to empower *Panchayats* as institutions of self-government is yet to happen. Progress in this respect has been uneven across states. The major aspects include:

### Functional Empowerment of Panchayats

1. The district, intermediate and village *Panchayats* have experience of working and are competent enough to shoulder the responsibility. Hence, all 29 matters listed must be fully devolved along with funds and functionaries upon the *Panchayats* in all States.
- 2. Activity mapping should not merely give powers of 'promotion' of programmes, but also substantive powers in local planning and implementation.
- 3. **Wider domain:** The domain of the *Panchayat* has to be widened. Revenue, regulation and development functions must be devolved upon *Panchayats*. Devolution of judicial powers and Police may also be considered.
- 4. **Organic link:** To establish organic linkages between *Panchayats* at all levels and District Planning Committees (DPCs), elected representatives of village and intermediate tiers should also be given representation in the DPCs, in addition to the representation given to members of the *Zila Panchayats*.
- 5. **Procedural Simplicity:** Administrative and financial procedures of the State and Central governments must be simplified and redesigned to facilitate planning and implementation by PRI.
- 6. **Self-Reliance:** In the era of globalization and liberalization, the spirit of self-help must be inculcated in the local levels and motivated to take up locally driven initiatives which need not necessarily be funded by the Central and State governments.

### Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan

- • Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) has been restructures as Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.
- A committee headed by Dr Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairperson NITI Aayog recommended the restructuring.
- • RGSA will help more than 2.55 lakh *Panchayati Raj* Institutions (PRIs) to develop governance capabilities to deliver on SDGs through inclusive local governance with focus on optimum utilization of available resources.
- • RGSA will have central component, national level activities including 'National Plan of Technical Assistance', 'Mission Mode Project on e-*Panchayat*', 'Incentivization of *Panchayats*' and State component—Capacity Building of PRIs, in the ratio of 60:40
- For North–eastern States it is in 90:10 and in UTs 100% central funding.

# Financial Empowerment of Panchayats

- 1. There must be regularity and clarity in the flow of funds to *Panchayats*. A *Panchayat* sector window should be opened in the budgets of all line departments (both in Centre and State) to ensure the flow of funds to each tier of the *Panchayats* to finance the functions devolved on them.
- 2. Similarly, activity mapping for functions and finances is required for Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) and other Central government funding streams such as Additional Central Assistance to enable local planning and implementation by *Panchayats*.
- 3. Funds should reach each *Panchayat* promptly after it has submitted its utilization reports.
- 4. *Panchayats* have to take earnest steps to mobilize our own revenue by undertaking systematic and timely assessments to fully survey our tax base and enforce tax collection, through a campaign mode approach. There must be no conditionality imposed by States on the expenditure and investments by *Panchayats* from their own revenues.
- 5. *Panchayats* should have access to bank credit to take up development projects such as universal housing for the poor, support to SHGs and their federations and construction of remunerative infrastructure assets, etc. The Government of India should frame a policy framework in this regard.

**...** 

#### Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP)

- • GPDP is the plan for economic development and social justice utilizing available resources.
- • *Gram Panchayats* have been mandated for preparation of GPDP.
- • GPDP process has to be comprehensive and based on participatory process.
- • It involves full convergence with schemes of all related Central Ministries/line departments related to 29 subjects in Eleventh Schedule.
- It was been undertaken in campaign mode in the period 2 October to 31 December 2018.

## Capacity Improvement of Panchayats

- 1. **Provision of staff for the Panchayats:**  Progressively, staff for performing functions devolved should be recruited by *Panchayats*. Clear powers of management and control must be given to the Chairpersons of all levels of *Panchayats*.
- 2. **Provision of adequate remuneration for elected Panchayat representatives at the District, Intermediate and Village levels**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

When 'cooperative federalism' is being institutionalized in the Centre-State financial relations, the task of percolating this spirit to the grass root level becomes a major challenge for us too... Accountability, Transparency and strong 'administrative will' together build the desired 'eco-system' where it is possible to translate political decentralization into financial decentralization. *Dr Jyoti Kiran Chairperson, Fifth State Finance Commission, Rajasthan*

With increasing responsibilities being given to *Panchayats* at all three levels, there is a need to make adequate provision for Travelling Allowances, Daily Allowances and provide adequate remuneration to the *Panchayat* representatives at all three levels in the same manner as is provided for MPs and MLAs. This matter should be addressed by State and Central governments.

### 3. **Training for Panchayat elected representatives and officials**

*Panchayat* elected representatives and officials should be provided sustained and high quality training through a system that fulfils their own training needs.

Training must also be flexible enough to meet specific requirements of *Panchayats*. Training materials should be easily accessible electronically and through help lines, call centres, interactive broadcasts and other modes of distance learning and replies to frequently asked questions, prepared in the local language based on the recommendations of the Gairola Committee Report.

There must be specialized training programmes for different groups, such as for women *Panchayat* representatives, SC/ST members.

### 4. **Provision of Physical infrastructure and Information Technology for** *Panchayats*

All *Panchayats* must be provided adequate physical infrastructure in the form of adequate office space, meeting and waiting rooms, toilets, recreational facilities, IT, telephone and road connectivity.[1]

#### 5. **Extending the reservation cycle to three terms**

In order to build and retain capacity and leadership among categories for whom seats are reserved in *Panchayats*, States shall consider favourably extending the reservation cycle to three five-year terms. The minimum term of Chairpersons of *Panchayats* should be five years.

#### Internship Program as a Part of Scheme of RGSA

- • To allow short-term exposure of 'selected candidates' with different Programme Divisions of Ministry of Panchayat Raj (MoPR), as 'Interns'
- • To allow young academic talent to be associated with the MoPR for mutual benefit.
- The 'Interns' shall have an opportunity to know about government functioning and policies relating to governance at local level particularly in the rural, social and economic.
- They will have to provide the inputs for preparing the briefs and analysis, based on the empirical evidence.

# Constitution of District Planning Committees by States in Conformity with the Provisions of Article 243ZD of the Constitution

Article 243ZD of the Constitution provides that every State shall constitute at the district level a District Planning Committee to consolidate the plans prepared by the *Panchayats* and the municipalities in the district and to prepare a draft development plan for the district as a whole.

High allocations to and implementation of MP and MLA Local Area Development Scheme, kills the spirit of participatory planning. Implementation of these programmes must be in convergence with the programmes taken up at the *Panchayat* levels.

*Panchayats* conduct *Gram Sabhas* not only prepare to a list of works, but also to fix priorities in implementation, as funds at them *Panchayats* level are limited. Line departments should not prepare their own priority lists for schemes such as MP and MLA Local Area Grants and take up works without the knowledge of the *Panchayats*. It must comply with the priority lists prepared by the *Gram Sabhas*.

#### Why DPC Important?

- It reflects the degree of inclusion of marginalized sections in the district planning process.
- It reflects the degree to which the DPC is actually a body independent of state control and interference

# Panchayat Raj in Areas Covered by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution

- The *Panchayats* (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) is a central legislation that extends the constitutional provisions *of Panchayati Raj* to Fifth Schedule Areas, subjected to certain exceptions and modifications. Nine States, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan have Fifth Schedule Areas.
- PESA provides that in *Panchayats* in 5th Schedule areas, there must be a minimum of fifty per cent reservation of the total number of seats for the Scheduled Tribes. All Chairpersons' seats in *Panchayats* are also to be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes.
- PESA lays down that every village will have a *Gram Sabha* which will be competent to safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of the people, their cultural identity, community resources and customary mode of dispute resolution.

• *Gram Sabhas* and *Panchayats* at the appropriate level have been specifically given the powers and authority to enforce prohibition or to regulate or extract the sale and consumption of any intoxicant, ownership of minor forest produce, power to prevent alienation of land, powers to manage village markets, power to exercise control over moneylending, power to exercise control over institutions and functionaries in all social sectors.

#### **Connect**

PESA exclusively empowers Gram Sabha to;

- Safequard and preserve the:
  - (a) Traditions and customs of the people, and their cultural identity.
  - (b) Community resources
  - (c) Customary mode of dispute resolution
- Carry out executive functions to
  - (a) Approve plans, programmes and projects for social and economic development.
  - (b) Identify persons as beneficiaries under the poverty alleviation and other programmes.
  - (c) Issue a certificate of utilization of funds by the *Panchayat* for the plans; programmes and projects.

### Review of PESA, 1996

- PESA provides that the recommendation of the *Gram Sabha* or the *Panchayats* at the appropriate level is mandatory prior to grant of prospecting license or mining lease for minor minerals. This provision should be amended to make it mandatory for obtaining the permission of the *Gram Sabha*, before granting prospecting license or mining lease.
- In PESA areas, the *Gram Sabhas* have been given executive powers and they can elect their traditional heads as the heads of the *Gram Sabhas*. There is a need to work out a harmonious relationship between the *Gram Sabhas* in PESA areas with the *Gram Panchayats*.
- While all States have enacted requisite compliance legislations by amending the respective *Panchayat Raj* Acts, certain gaps continue to exist. Most States are yet to amend the subject laws, like those relating to moneylending, forest, excise, etc., to bring these into conformity with PESA.
- Central legislations such as the Indian Land Acquisition Act, the Forest Conservation Act, and the Indian Registration Act will also need to be harmonized with the provisions of PESA. States and relevant central ministries must take concrete steps to harmonize the provisions of the laws and policies concerned with the aims and objectives of PESA.
- Powers statutorily devolved upon the *Gram Sabha* and the *Panchayats* are not being matched by concomitant transfer of funds and functionaries resulting in the no exercise of such powers.
- More than 11 years after its enactment there is little or no awareness about the provisions of PESA. Therefore, it is imperative that all persons in PESA areas are given in-depth training on the provisions of PESA through awareness campaigns. Officials concerned with the implementation of PESA should also be properly sensitized.
- Physical infrastructure in interior areas should be strengthened in order to protect the life and property of tribals. Special attention should be paid to the construction of culverts, bridges, check dams, compound walls for schools, etc.
- As of now, ownership of Minor Forest Produce does not vest with tribals. Steps should be taken to ensure that they get the best remunerative price for their Minor Forest Produce.

#### Definition of Village and Gram Sabha

A village shall ordinarily consist of a habitation or a group of habitations or a hamlet or a group of hamlets comprising a community and managing its affairs in accordance with traditions and customs.

Every village shall have a *Gram Sabha* consisting of persons whose names are included in the electoral rolls for the *Panchayat* at the village level.

Source: PESA Act, [Section 4 (b)].

Consequently, compliance with PESA remains incomplete and perfunctory in virtually all States. Vital issues like the ownership of minor forest produce, planning and management of minor water bodies, prevention of alienation of tribal lands, etc., which have been duly recognized in PESA as the traditional rights of tribals living in the Scheduled Areas have still not received the warranted attention and the necessary correctives remain unapplied.

# Decentralization in Areas Not Covered by the Provisions of Parts IX and IXA of the Constitution

The entire philosophy of the Sixth Schedule of the constitution is aimed at protection of tribal areas and interests, by constitutionally mandating regional or district local self-government institutions for them. These institutions are entrusted with the twin task of protecting tribal culture and customs and undertake development tasks for them. The provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the constitution should be operationalized in letter and spirit.

Areas that fall outside the purview of both *Panchayati Raj* and the Sixth Schedule must also provide for regular elections to local autonomous councils, so that the tribal people concerned can meet their aspirations for local democracy and decentralized and inclusive growth.

There is a significant degree of variation in the functions devolved to one autonomous district as compared to another. The minimum extent of powers given to a District Council ought to be at least that enunciated in the Eleventh Schedule of the constitution, which can be considered as an indicative list in this case also.

To make district planning in Sixth Schedule areas both inclusive and representative, autonomous councils will need to live harmoniously with traditional arrangements. For this reason, these bodies should be given clear development functions, in addition to the regulatory, legislative and judicial powers bestowed upon them.

### Importance and Benefits of PESA

- (a) It will enhance people's participation in decision-making.
- (b) PESA will reduce alienation in tribal areas as they will have better control over the utilization of public resources.
- (c) PESA will reduce poverty and out-migration among tribal population as they will have control and management of natural resources will improve their livelihoods and incomes.
- (d) PESA will minimize exploitation of tribal population as they will be able to control and manage moneylending, consumption and sale of liquor and also village markets.
- (e) Effective implementation of PESA will check illegal land alienation and also restore unlawfully alienated tribal land.
- (f) And most importantly PESA will promote cultural heritage through preservation of traditions, customs and cultural identity of tribal population.

## Activating Community Participation at the Grass Roots

- The constitution defines *Gram Sabha* as a body consisting of voters relating to a village comprised within a *Panchayat*. The peoples' right to participate in local democracy must be interpreted in its widest sense. Therefore, the term *Gram Sabha* must be understood in its holistic sense and not in a restrictive sense as an occasional meeting of voters. Since participation of people is most important, members of the *Gram Sabha* should be consulted even at their doorstep through surveys and ward and neighbourhood level meetings.
- The legal framework and the practice of holding two levels of *Gram Sabha* meetings in some States, at the ward or habitation level and at the GP level should be implemented in all States, except in those States where the sizes of *Gram Panchayats* are very small.
- Good *Panchayat* level practices such as the Kudumbashree programme of Kerala, which has fostered a vibrant participation between poor and marginalized members of the *Gram Sabha*, with the *Gram Panchayats*, should be promoted in all States.
- There must be universal endowment of the Ward/*Gram Sabha* with meaningful empowerment through such measures as giving them powers to approve before implementation commences, plans and programmes (including budgets) for economic development and social justice prepared by the *Gram Panchayat*, to authorize the issuance *Panchayat* and to undertake the identification of beneficiaries.
- Social audit is an important complement to formal audit and for the sound and healthy development of *Panchayati Raj*, it is essential to establish a symbiotic relationship between social and formal audit. For social audit to be effective and based on the best practices available in different States.

## Rural Business Hubs

- *Panchayats* need to be aware of the opportunities that exist for them to plan for economic development of their area and could promote rural non-farm enterprises, which utilize local skills and/or resources and generate/promote rural employment through Public Private *Panchayat* Partnership.
- Artisan based clusters established under different schemes of the Central or State Governments and organizations such as the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, the NABARD and the Development Commissioner, Handicrafts must enable a clear role for *Panchayats* to be proactive in enabling convergence with existing schemes.
- The *Panchayats* could also actively promote local entrepreneurship through external facilitation, capacity building, access to credit, etc., and thus, play the lead role for rural development and economic empowerment, by acting as the gateway for Central/State schemes and interventions of bank and other institutions.

### *Incentives for Panchayat Performance*

- To motivate and assist *Panchayats* to use their newly enlarged responsibilities in a focused and productive fashion and ensure that *Panchayats* achieve standards that meet norms set out for public accountability.
- *Panchayats* at all levels should be awarded for their annual improvement over the previous year in the achievement of the goals of transparency and accountability to their respective *Gram Sabhas* and efficiency in performing their roles and responsibilities.

## Creating a National Network of Panchayat Representatives

In order to gain strength from each other, share experiences and best practices and gain a collective voice, a national network of *Panchayat* elected representatives can be created. The other functions can be as follows:

- Organize training programmes, field visits and study tours,
- Undertake peer reviews and benchmark performances of member *Panchayats* at all levels.Network with similar institutions nationally and internationally.

# Federation from the Grass Roots Level

- There shall be an intermediate level association at each intermediate *Panchayat* level. The general body of the association shall be comprised of three members selected from each *Gram Panchayats*.
- There shall be a district level association for each district. The general body of the association shall be comprised of three members selected from each intermediate level association. The district level association will also provide adequate representation for elected representatives of District *Panchayats*.
- There shall be a national level federation of elected *Panchayats* representatives, the general body of which shall be comprised of three members elected from each state level association. Each of the three members selected from each State shall represent one level of *Panchayat*. Representation from States may be increased depending on the rural population of the State.

# ACTIONS TAKEN TOWARDS REFORM PRIS

## Bharat Broadband Project

- It is a company incorporated under Indian Companies Act 1956, fully owned by Central Government, with equity participation from Government, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), RailTel and Power Grid. BBNL is the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set-up for the implementation of National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) scheme.
- NOFN is for providing broadband connectivity to all *Gram Panchayats* through optical fibre cable. The connectivity to *Gram Panchayats* will be provided through this network for establishing e-governance.
- The project, based on a unique PPP or Public Private *Panchayats* Model, aims to connect 2.5 lakh villages and last mile connectivity will be given through mobile-wireless broadband.
- A majority of the funding for this network is being sourced from the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), to which consumers contribute a small percentage every month through their monthly telephone bills.

### e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project

It is to introduce and strengthen e-Governance in PRIs and build their associated capacities for effective adoption of e-Governance initiative.

Under this project, *Panchayat* Enterprise Suite (PES) has been conceptualized which comprises 11 core common applications.

The operational modules include Local Government Directory (LGD), Area Profiler (socio-economic and general details), Plan Plus (to strengthen decentralized and participatory planning), PRIASoft (*Panchayati Raj* Accounting Software), Action Soft (Works/scheme implementation Monitoring System), NAD (National Asset Directory), Service Plus (to facilitate service delivery), Social Audit, Training and National *Panchayat* Portal (Dynamic website).

### Features of Application

- 1. Social Audit: It involves auditing of various schemes by social auditor and social audit facilitator and submission of audit report. SAMM aims to understand measure, verify work under different schemes done by the *Panchayat* and further to improve social performance of respective *Panchayats*.
- 2. Meeting Management: Management of meetings at *Panchayat* level to enable transparent and user-friendly flow of system.

Source: Social Audit Website: Government of India.

### *Barriers*

The barriers to reaping the full benefits of this massive investment are at three levels.

- The first is affordable devices, preferably wireless and ready for early use.
- The second challenge relates to relevant, local content. The movement of content from Anglocentric, text-based availability to multilingual access would assist immensely in deepening internet usage.
- The third is by way of successful introduction of telemedicine, e-governance, e-learning and e-commerce applications that form the fulcrum of the nation's e-infrastructure.

### *Advantages*

- A World Bank study revealed that a 10 per cent increase in broadband connectivity helps in pushing the GDP growth by 1.4 per cent. The optic fibre network will help bring various electronic and internet-based initiatives of the government to the people living in the remotest corner of the country.
- NOFN will enable effective and faster implementation of various mission mode e-governance projects amounting to  $\bar{z}50,000$  crore initiated by the Department of Information Technology.
- It will also enable the delivery of a whole range of electronic services by the private sector to citizens in rural areas.

### Plan Plus

- Plan Plus is software developed by NIC, under guidance and direction from Ministry of Panchayati Raj, in order to demystify and strengthen the decentralized planning process.
- The software is web-based software and captures the entire planning workflow starting from identification of needs, the plan approval process till the final approval by the District Planning Committee.
- The software is highly generic and can be extended to capture the plans prepared by line departments at the State and Central level to generate the National Plan.
- The objective of Plan Plus is to facilitates the decentralized planning process in local language by:
  - Supporting need/activity-based planning rather than scheme-driven.
  - Converging the flow of funds from different Central and State sponsored schemes.
  - Capturing the planning workflow.
  - Converging the rural and urban plans to generate an integrated district plan.

# Reservation of Seats for Women: Constitution versus Customary Law Nagaland Issue

The matter of reserving one-third of the seats in the municipalities for women has triggered violent protests in Nagaland. Joint Action Committee of Women Reservation (JACWR) has been demanding for the equality and parity of treatment of women with men. JACWR had filed many cases and had taken a long legal course towards achieving this objective. The Constitution (74th Amendment) Act 1992, inserted Article 243T which makes it an obligation to the reserve one-third of the seats in the municipalities for women.

However, Article 243M exempts the application of the provisions of *Panchayats* to the State of Nagaland. Article 243ZC exempts the application of the provisions relating to municipalities to tribal areas, which includes the State also. Further, Article 371A provides that any law enacted by the Parliament in respect of:

- Religious or social practices of the Nagas
- Naga customary law and procedure
- Administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Naga customary law

Ownership and transfer of land and its resourcesshall be applicable to Nagaland only when the State Legislative Assembly declares by a resolution. As a sequel to 74th amendment, the Nagaland Municipal Act, 2001 did not contain the provision for reservation.

The elections to the municipalities were conducted without reserving the seats for women in 2004. The JACWR challenged this in the Guwahati High Court in 2005. The high court directed the Nagaland government to take appropriate steps to provide reservation for women. However, no such step was taken by the government and election to the local bodies could not be conducted in 2009 as per the schedule due to the opposition from the tribal groups against reservation.

This was further challenged and in 2001 a single member bench of the Guwahati High Court directed the State government to conduct election with reservation. The government appealed against this order to a division bench which set aside the order. Subsequently in 2012, the Nagaland Assembly passed a resolution that reservation under Article 243T does not apply to the State as it infringes on Article 371A.

Annoyed by this the JACWR filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP under Article 136) against the order of the Division Bench of the Guwahati High Court and the Assembly resolution. The Supreme Court held that the provision for reservation supersedes Article 371A and so reserving seats for women in municipal bodies was mandatory and binding.

As a sequel, the Nagaland Municipal Act, 2001 was amended and the elections were scheduled to be conducted in February 2017.

The Naga Tribal bodies representing 16 main tribal groups (Locally called as *HoHos*) opposed this move on the ground that any policy to provide for reservation to women will be conflicting with the tribal customary laws. The tribal bodies are of the view that it would be a premature move to introduce reservation without taking certain preparatory steps. They are of the view that the role women were fully and adequately recognized at the family level in the private spheres. But to give an equal role to women on *par* with men would conflict with the established cultural practices.

At surface the issue appears to be a conflict between the customary law and the constitution. However, one must clearly understand the fact that the constitution does not permit any regressive practice or customary law to sustain. The constitutional protection is granted only to preserve the culture with its uniqueness. But it does not guarantee the right to preserve the regressive cultural practices. The constitution clearly empowers the State to undertake reform measures towards social development and progress. In case, such measures conflict with the cultural and religious values or practices then the constitutional values and objectives are to given primacy over them.

Any culture has to be dynamic and evolve with time. In the garb of upholding traditions, a society must not live in the past, for it will reduce the society to a static entity. The traditional societies have not provided any role for women in decision-making or in political spheres. When an unbiased environment is created women have proved their effectiveness. It becomes essential to remove the social barriers that prevent women and correct the historical error. Hence, the reservation for women in local body elections is inevitable to enable women participate positively.
