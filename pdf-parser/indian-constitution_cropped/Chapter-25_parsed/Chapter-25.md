## **Duties**

Article 149 provides for the duties and powers of the CAGI. According to the constitution, the Parliament is to determine the 'duties and powers' of the Auditor General by law. Accordingly, the Parliament has enacted the CAGI (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Services) Act. According to the Act, the CAGI is:

- 1. To audit and report on all expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India and of each State and each Union Territory having a legislative assembly as to whether such expenditure has been in accordance with the law.
- 2. To audit and report on all expenditure from the Contingency Fund of India and of the states.
- 3. To audit and report on all trading, manufacturing, profit and loss accounts, etc., kept by any department of the Union or a state.
- 4. To audit the receipts and expenditure of the Union and of each state to satisfy himself that the rules and procedures in that behalf are designed to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of revenue.
- 5. To audit and report on the receipts and expenditure of:
  - (a) All local bodies and authorities 'substantially financed' from the Union or State revenues.
  - (b) Government companies and other corporations or bodies, when so required by the laws relating to such corporations or bodies.

In performing the above duties, the CAG conducts:

- (i) Audit against provision of funds
- (ii) Regularity audit
- (iii) Propriety audit
- (iv) Efficiency-cum-performance audit and
- (v) Systems audit

#### Audit Advisory Board

- • Constituted to provide suggestions on matters relating to audit, including coverage, scope and prioritization of audits.
- It also suggests regarding audit approaches and techniques.
- The members of the Audit Advisory Board will function in an honorary capacity.
- • The CAGI is the *ex officio* Chairman of the Board

#### **Audit Against Provision of Funds**

It is the audit to check whether the money spent was legally granted and sanctioned by the Parliament for the purpose for which it was spent.

#### **Regularity Audit**

It is the audit to check whether the expenditure was sanctioned by the appropriate authority. Also, it checks whether the person who sanctioned the expenditure was the appropriate authority under law.

#### **Propriety Audit**

It is the audit to check whether the principles of economy are followed while spending the money. The propriety audit confers upon the CAG the power of discretionary audit. It checks the 'wisdom, faithfulness and economy' in the expenditure made. The first ever case in which the CAGI applied his discretionary audit is the Bofor's kickback case.

#### **Efficiency-cum-performance Audit**

It appraises the implementation of the development programmes. The audit assesses to what extent the social and economic objectives of the programmes within the sanctioned cost.

#### **Systems Audit**

It assesses the systems and processes that govern the authorization of accounting, the control systems, the quality standards and audits the performance.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Exercise of CAG's powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and the States is derived from Article 149 of the Indian Constitution. Discuss whether audit of the government's policy implementation could amount to overstepping its own (CAG) jurisdiction.

*IAS MAINS (GS) Paper II 2016*

From the propriety audit, efficiency-cum-performance audit and the systems audit the CAGI gets the authority to audit the performance and to conduct 'value for money' audit. However, it is well known that the CAGI shall not scrutinize the policy matters and principles of the expenditure as they are already approved by the Parliament. But the CAGI (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Services) Act has not explicitly prohibiting the CAGI from scrutinizing them. While checking for the performance and ensuring value for money the CAGI eventually ends up checking the policy of the department.

There are two views prevailing on this. One section is of the view that, the CAGI is overstepping his jurisdiction and encroaches on the domain of the executive and the legislature. For instance, the CAGI declared the 'presumed loss' caused to the State in the Spectrum 2G auctions by following the policy formulated in 2001. This is considered as the overstepping of the CAGI. Earlier in 1999, when the CAGI questioned the purchase of the coffins for the Kargil soldiers also it was criticized that the CAG overstepped the jurisdiction by scrutinizing the charged expenditure. Similarly, in the coal mine allocation the CAG released the highlights of his report to press immediately after submitting the report to President. It was criticized because the report has not been tabled in the Parliament.

On the other hand, this is more viewed as an eventual consequence and cannot be considered as overstepping the jurisdiction. In the era of Good Governance, transparency, accountability and value for taxpayer's money are to be ensured by the CAGI. It is an accepted principle that it is the duty of the CAGI is to ensure that not even a rupee of the public money is wasted. In the process it is inevitable that the CAGI steps into the policy issues.

## FINANCE COMMISSION (ARTICLE 280)

Article 280 provides for the constitution of a Finance Commission. The commission is constituted every five years. It is a constitutional obligation on the President to constitute a Finance Commission at the expiry of every five years.

## ZONAL COUNCILS

Zonal Councils have been established by the States Reorganization in Act, 1956 to advice on matters of common interest to each of the five zones into which the territory of India has been divided—Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and Central.

It should be remembered that these Zonal Councils do not owe their origin to the constitution but to an Act of Parliament, having been introduced by the States Reorganization Act, as a part of the scheme of reorganization of the States with a view to securing cooperation and coordination as between the States, the Union Territories and the Union, particularly in respect of economic 'and social development.

The creation of the Zonal Councils was a logical outcome of the reorganization of the States On a linguistic basis. For, if the cultural and economic affinity of linguistic States with their contiguous States was to be maintained and their common interests were to be served by cooperative action, a common meeting ground of some sort was indispensable. The object of these Councils, as Pandit Nehru envisaged it, is to 'develop the habit of cooperative working'. The presence of a Union Minister, nominated by the Union government, in each of these Councils (and the Chief Ministers of the States concerned) also furthers coordination and national integration through an extra-constitutional advisory organization, without undermining the autonomy of the States. If properly worked, these Councils would thus foster the 'federal sentiment' by resisting the separatist tendencies of linguism and provincialism.

- (i) The Central Zone, comprising the States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand.
- (ii) The Northern Zone, comprising the States of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, and the Union Territories of Delhi and Chandigarh.
- (iii) The Eastern Zone, comprising the States of Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand.

- (iv) The Western Zone, comprising the States of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa and the Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu.
- (v) The Southern Zone, comprising, the States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry.
- (vi) The North Eastern Zone, comprising the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh.

Each Zonal Council consists of the Chief Minister and two other Ministers of each of the Sates in the Zone and the Administrator in the case of a Union Territory. There is also provision in for holding joint meetings of two or more Zonal Councils. The Union Home Minister has been nominated to be the common chairman of all the Zonal Councils.

The Zonal Councils, as already stated, discuss matters of common concern to the States and Territories comprised in each Zone, such as, economic and social planning, border disputes, interstate transport, matters arising out of the reorganization of States and the like, and give advice to the governments of the States concerned as well as the Government of India.

## Objectives of Zonal Council[3]

The main objectives of setting up of Zonal Councils are as under:

- Bringing out national integration
- Arresting the growth of acute State consciousness, regionalism, linguism and particularistic tendencies
- Enabling the Centre and the States to cooperate and exchange ideas and experiences
- Establishing a climate of cooperation amongst the States for successful and speedy execution of development projects.

## Functions of the Councils

Each Zonal Council is an advisory body and may discuss any matter in which some or all of the States represented in that Council, or the Union and one or more of the States represented in that Council, have a common interest and advise the Central government and the government of each State concerned as to the action to be taken on any such matter. In particular, a Zonal Council may discuss, and make recommendations with regard to:

- Any matter of common interest in the field of economic and social planning.
- Any matter concerning border disputes, linguistic minorities or interstate transport.
- Any matter connected with, or arising out of, the reorganization of the States under the State's Reorganization Act.

## North-Eastern Council

The seven North Eastern States are not included in the Zonal Councils. The North Eastern Council, set-up under the North Eastern Council Act, 1972 deals with the special problems relating to these States. The State of Sikkim has also been included in the North Eastern Council by North Eastern Council (Amendment) Act, 2002. Consequently, a Sikkim is excluded as member of Eastern Zonal Council.

## ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS

The original constitution did not contain any provision relating to the administrative tribunals. The Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act added Part XIVA and inserted Articles 323A and 323B providing for the Administrative Tribunals. Article 323A provides for setting up of Administrative Tribunals and Article 323B for other tribunals. Administrative tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies. The reasons for setting up of administrative tribunals are:

<sup>6</sup> The Official Languages Act, 1963

- (a) To provide speedy and inexpensive justice
- (b) To lessen the burden of the courts
- (c) To simplify the procedures as the legal procedures in the regular courts are cumbersome and time consuming
- (d) The regular courts do not have the expertise to deal with the administrative issues.
- (e) The regular courts take legal approach in deciding the cases whereas the administrative tribunals comprising both administrative judicial members can be more rational in adjudicating the administrative matters.

# Article 323A

Parliament is empowered to establish administrative tribunal for 'adjudication of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services' by a law.

# Article 323B

Both Union Parliament and State legislature can establish tribunal 'for the adjudication or trial by tribunals of any disputes, complaints, or offences with respect to all or any of the matters relating to':

- (a) Levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax
- (b) Foreign exchange, import and export across customs frontiers
- (c) Industrial and labour disputes
- (d) Land reforms by way of acquisition by the State of any estate as defined in Article 31A

# ALTERNATIVE DISPUTES RESOLUTION MECHANISMS (ADRS)

ADRs are those dispute settlement mechanisms other than the courts. Since the courts are overburdened and there are several disputes which are not predominantly legal in nature the ADRs are set-up to deal with them. Administrative tribunals are included in the concept of Alternative Disputes Resolution Mechanisms.

# Need for ADRs

Abraham Lincoln said 'Litigation does not always lead to a satisfactory result. It is expensive in terms of time and money. A case won or lost in court of law does not change the mind-set of the litigants who continue to be adversaries and go on fighting in appeals after appeals. Alternate Dispute Resolution systems enable the change in mental approach of the parties.' The need for ADRs arise out of the following reasons:

- (a) Congestion in courts due to numerous litigations
- (b) Lack of adequate manpower and resources and the consequent delay
- (c) High cost involved in litigation
- (d) The rigidity of procedure in the courts
- (e) Lack of opportunity for participatory roles

**ADRs: Advantages[7]:** The ADRs have several advantages. According to World Intellectual Property Organization, (WIPO) the following are the most important advantages of ADRs:

**RA 80** 

<sup>7</sup> http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/center/advantages.html

- **A Single Procedure:** Through ADR, the parties can agree to resolve in a single procedure a dispute involving intellectual property that is protected in a number of different countries, thereby avoiding the expense and complexity of multijurisdictional litigation, and the risk of inconsistent results.
- **Party Autonomy:** Because of its private nature, ADR affords parties the opportunity to exercise greater control over the way their dispute is resolved than would be the case in court litigation.

In contrast to court litigation, the parties themselves may select the most appropriate decision-makers for their dispute. In addition, they may choose the applicable law, place and language of the proceedings.

Increased party autonomy can also result in a faster process, as parties are free to devise the most efficient procedures for their dispute. This can result in material cost savings.

- **Neutrality:** ADR can be neutral to the law, language and institutional culture of the parties, thereby avoiding any home court advantage that one of the parties may enjoy in court-based litigation, where familiarity with the applicable law and local processes can offer significant strategic advantages.
- **Confidentiality:** ADR proceedings are private. Accordingly, the parties can agree to keep the proceedings and any results confidential.

This allows them to focus on the merits of the dispute without concern about its public impact, and may be of special importance where commercial reputations and trade secrets are involved.

- **Finality of Awards:** Unlike court decisions, which can generally be contested through one or more rounds of litigation, arbitral awards are not normally subjected to appeal.
- **Enforceability of Awards:** The United Nations Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958, known as the New York Convention, generally provides for the recognition of arbitral awards on par with domestic court judgments without review on the merits. This greatly facilitates the enforcement of awards across borders.

**Disadvantages of ADR:** ADRs do not guarantee complete resolution of the disputes. In such circumstances there is a possibility of moving the courts which results in the wasting of time and money. This brings the credibility of the ADRs to question.

In case of Arbitration as an ADR the decisions are final and cannot be appealed. But the decisions of a court can be appealed to a higher court. So, it is sometimes ADRs are considered rigid.

At times the participation becomes as weakness of ADRs. The participation leads to confusion as the parties to dispute do not want to negotiate. Instead they would want to move the court.

**ADRs in India[8]:** Although there are many types of ADRs, in India three types are used. Such ADRs in practice are arbitration, mediation and conciliation.

Arbitration<sup>[9]</sup>: Arbitration is a process in which a neutral third party provides a decision based on the merits of the case. In the Indian context the scope of the rules for the arbitration process are set out broadly by the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1998 and in the areas uncovered by the statute the parties are free to design an arbitration process appropriate and relevant to their disputes.

**Mediation**<sup>[10]</sup>: The process of mediation aims to facilitate the development of a consensual solution by the disputing parties. The mediation process is overseen by a non-partisan third party, the mediator. The authority of the mediator vests on the consent of the parties that he should facilitate their negotiations.

<sup>8</sup> http://www.archive.india.gov.in/citizen/lawnorder.php?id=12-.

<sup>9</sup>  *Ibid.*

<sup>10</sup> *Ibid.*
**Conciliation**<sup>[11]</sup>: This is a process by which resolution of disputes is achieved by compromise or voluntary agreement. In contrast to arbitration, the conciliator does not render a binding award. The parties are free to accept or reject the recommendations of the conciliator. The conciliator is in the Indian context, often a government official whose report contains recommendations.

**International Centre for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ICADR)**<sup>[12]</sup>: It is an autonomous body registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. It was set-up by the Department of Legal Affairs. The Minister for Law and Justice is the Chairman of ICADR. The main object of the ICADR is to promote popularize and propagate Alternative Dispute Resolution to facilitate early resolution of disputes so as to reduce the burden of arrears in the courts.

Its headquarters is in New Delhi. It has two regional centres in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

- (ii) A body which is wholly or partially owned by the government and the salary or remuneration for such office is paid by such body, except where such salary or remuneration paid is compensatory in nature.

## Annual Financial Statement

The constitution uses the term 'Annual Financial Statement' for the budget. The Annual Financial Statement is 'a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the Government of India for that year'.

# Charged Expenditures

Charged expenditures are those expenditures that are 'standing' in nature pertaining to certain expenditures of basic nature. Certain expenditures are kept away from the annual voting of the Parliament considering the importance of the office related to which the expenditure is made. For instance, considering the constitutional importance of the office of the President, the salary and allowances of the President cannot be left to the annual voting of the Parliament. Similarly, in order to protect the independence of the judiciary, the salary and allowances of the judges are made charged expenditures.

These expenditures are not subjected to vote in the Parliament every year. The Parliament has the powers only to discuss the estimates of the charged expenditure. Hence, they are known as 'non-votable' expenditures. Any expenditure can be declared as charged on consolidated fund by a law. A bill to declare any expenditure as charged expenditure or alter the expenditure is a Money Bill.

# Demand for Grants[14]

Earmarking of budgetary allocation for meeting the plan and non-plan expenditure of a Ministry/ Department is known as demand for grants. While voting the demands for grants the House may pass cut motions. The details of the cut motions are given in chapter 14 on Union legislatures.

<sup>14</sup> For Cut Motions: Refer Chapter 14: Union legislature.

# Appropriation Bill (Article 114)

It is a Money Bill voted by Lok Sabha, providing for the withdrawal or appropriation of moneys from and out of the Consolidated Fund of India. It has to be passed for appropriation of moneys to meet grants made by the Parliament and the expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund for the services of a financial year or a part of a financial year. It can be passed once annually or at various times of the year.

# Supplementary Grants

Article 115 provides for the Supplementary Grants, Additional Grants and Excess Grants. If the amount authorized by the Appropriation Act (Article 114) of the Parliament, for the expenditure of a particular service during the current financial year is found to be insufficient, then a supplementary grant is made.

# Additional Grants

In case a need for spending upon some new service which was not contemplated in the annual financial statement for that year arises, an additional grant is made.

# Excess Grants

If the money is spent in excess of the amount granted by the Parliament on any service during a financial year then, an excess grant is made. The excess grant is made only after the expiry of the financial year. It is made only after the approval of the Public Accounts Committee.

## Vote on Account

Article 116 provides for the vote on account, vote of credit and the exceptional grant. A Vote on account is a lump sum grant made by the Parliament to the government. It is made to enable the government to meet the operational expenditures during when the budget is pending in the Parliament.

Usually, the vote on account is granted for two months. Hence, one-sixth of the total estimates are grated as vote on account. However, during an election year the vote on account may be granted for a period longer than two months, say for three months. Since it is a lump sum grant no detailed discussion of the estimates of the expenditure takes place.

#### **Interim Budget**

An interim budget is a full-fledged budget but for a period lesser than one year. Usually a budget is made and sanctioned for one year. An interim budget is made for a period less than one year. In case of an election year the new government formed in the mid-year presents an interim budget. An interim budget is different from vote on account.

| Interim Budget                                        | <b>Votes on account</b>                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| Subjected to discussion of the Parliament             | Not subjected to discussion of the Parliament             |
| Cut motions are permitted                             | Cut motions are not permitted                             |

### *Vote of Credit*

A grant made for meeting an unexpected demand upon the resources of India when on account of the magnitude or the indefinite character of the service the demand cannot be stated with the details ordinarily given in an annual financial statement is known as a vote of credit.

n n n

For example, the expenditure relating to intelligence or war is not definite and so a vote of credit is given. It is granted by the Parliament on the trust it has on the government. It is also known as a 'blank cheque' granted to the government.

88 A

### *Exceptional Grant*

An exceptional grant is made for an expenditure that does not form part of any financial year. For example, an expenditure relating to celebrating any anniversary such as the golden jubilee of enactment of the constitution as it occurs only once and will not be part of the expenditure of any financial year.

### *Consolidated Fund*

Article 266 provides for the Consolidated Fund of India and the Consolidated Fund of each State. As the name suggests it is a fund formed by consolidating:

- (i) All revenues received by the government
- (ii) All loans raised by that government by the issue of Treasury bills
- (iii) All loans or ways and means advances and
- (iv) All moneys received by that government in repayment of loans

Authorization of the legislature [Article 266(3)], Parliament in case of Consolidated Fund of India and State legislature in case of Consolidated Fund of a State, is required to withdraw or appropriate any money from the consolidated fund. An Appropriation Act is to be enacted.

### *Public Accounts*

All other public moneys than those form the Consolidated Fund, received by or on behalf of the government are paid into the public accounts. There is a Public Account of India and public account for each State. To withdraw from the public accounts, an appropriation act is not needed.

### *Contingency Fund*

Article 267 provides for the Contingency Fund. It is an 'imprest' in nature kept at the disposal of the President in case of Union and Governor in case of State. Hence, it is a rechargeable corpus which can be used in case any contingency when the money forms the consolidated fund could not spent. To spend the money from the contingency fund prior authorization of the legislature is not required.

#### *'Finance Bill'*

It is a Bill ordinarily introduced every year to give effect to the financial proposals of the government for the following financial year and includes a Bill to give effect to supplementary financial proposals for any period. Thus, it refers to the bill that deals with the finances of the government.

## *Grants-in-aid (Article 273, 275 and 282)*

Grants in aid are an assistance that is paid out of Consolidated Fund of India to the States for certain purposes. The constitution provides for grants in three different articles and they relate to different types of grants.

- (i) Grants *in lieu* of export duties on Jute and Jute products to Assam, Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal. This provision has become inoperative with effect from 26 January 1960. It was to survive for ten years from the commencement of the constitution (Article 273).
- (ii) Article 275 provides for grants-in-aid to the States. Different sums may be fixed for different States depending on the assessment of their need. Special grants may be given for promoting the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes or for raising the level of administration of the Scheduled Areas.
- (iii) Article 282 empowers the Union and the States to make grant for any public purpose. It may even give grant for a purpose for which it may not have power to make laws.

### *Tax and Fee*

The constitution recognizes that taxes are different from fees. The prohibition in Article 265 is in respect of taxes. Fees are not covered by it. The distinction between the two is that a tax is a compulsory exaction for the general benefit. It is levied as a part of common burden. Its purpose is to collect revenue.

Fee is also a compulsory exaction but it has some relation to a special benefit or privilege accruing to the individual who pays.

| <b>Tax</b>                                                                    | <b>Fees</b>                                                                                                                                                         |

**Power to Levy Tax:** Article 265 provides that 'no tax may be levied or collected except by authority of law'. So, any tax cannot be imposed by executive order. It can be levied only by an Act of appropriate legislature. Thus, the constitution provides for the principle of 'No taxation without representation'. Hence, it demands that there must be a valid law for imposing a tax. Imposing any tax is subjected to judicial review as to:

- (a) Whether the law is within the legislative competence of the legislature related to an entry in the relevant list.
- (b) Whether the law is not prohibited by any specific provision of the constitution, e.g., Articles 276, 285, 286, 287, etc.
- (c) Whether the law is void under Article 13 for violating a fundamental right.

Based on the above provisions the taxes are imposed by the State are grouped as follows:

- Article 268: Taxes levied by Union but collected and appropriated by States
- Article 268A: Service tax levied by Union and collected and appropriated by Union and States
- Article 269: Taxes levied and collected by Union and assigned to State
- Article 270: Taxes levied and collected by Union and distributed between Union and States
- Article 271: Surcharge for the Union

**Taxes levied by the Union but collected and appropriated by the States:** Some taxes are levied by the Union but collected and appropriated by the States. These are collected by the States and are assigned to the States. They are to be levied by the Union but the Union has no share in the proceeds (Article 268). They are:

- Stamp duties mentioned in the Union list
- Duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations

Service tax<sup>(15)</sup> levied by the Union and collected and appropriated by the Union and the States **(Article 268A):** Article 268A has been inserted by the 88th Amendment in the year 2003. By inserting this article, it has been provided that taxes on services shall be levied by the Government of India. Service tax shall be collected by the Government of India and the States. The proceeds of service tax shall be divided between the Union and the States in accordance with the principles formulated by Parliament by law.

**Article 269A: Power of Parliament to impose Goods and Service Tax:** Parliament is empowered to enact law to impose Goods and Service tax on interstate trade and commerce in accordance with the recommendations of the GST Council. The Parliament also has the power to formulate the principles for determining the place of supply, and when a supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of interstate trade or commerce.

In this regard, supply of goods, or of services, or both in the course of import into the territory of India shall be deemed to be supply of goods, or of services, or both in the course of interstate trade or commerce. Such portion of the tax amount apportioned to a State shall not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India.

Similarly, if an amount collected as tax levied under Article 269A (1) has been used for payment of the tax levied by a State under Article  $246A<sub>i</sub><sup>(16)</sup>$  such amount shall not form part of the Consolidated Fund of India. Also, if an amount collected as tax levied by a State under Article 246A has been used for payment of the tax levied under Clause (1), such amount shall not form part of the Consolidated Fund of the State.

<sup>15</sup> After the GST Act comes into force the service tax will be abolished

<sup>16</sup> 'Article 246A. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and, subjected to clause (2), the legislature of every State, have power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State. (2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of interstate trade or commerce.

**Taxes levied and collected by the Union and assigned to the State (Article 269):** Some taxes are levied by the Union and collected by the Union but are assigned to the States. Two taxes fall in this category:

- (a) Interstate Sales tax
- (b) Consignment tax

These taxes will be levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States in accordance with the principles formulated by the Parliament by law (Article 269).

**Taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between the Union and the States (Ar**ticle 270): Article 270 lays down that all taxes and duties referred to in the Union list levied and collected by the Union (except those mentioned in Articles 268, 268A and 269) are distributable between the Union and the States.

The manner of sharing of the proceeds shall be determined by a Presidential order after considering the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

This new Article 270 inserted in 2000 with effect from 1996 has augmented the resources of the States.

TABLE 25.1 Taxes and Duties Fast Recap *(Continue)*

**Surcharge for the Union (Article 271):** Article 271 provides for levy of surcharges on duties and taxes. The proceeds of such surcharges go to the Union exclusively. From time to time the government imposes a surcharge on Income tax, Corporate tax, etc. It has also levied surcharge and additional surcharge for the purposes of the Union on Customs and Excise duties. The States have no share in the surcharges.

**'Net Proceeds' of Taxes and Duties:** 'Net Proceeds' means the proceeds, amount collected from tax and duty, reduced by the cost of collection—the amount of money spent for the collection of the tax. The CAGI certifies the net proceeds.

### *'Crossing the floor'*

Passing between the member addressing the House and the Chair is known as 'crossing the floor'. It is considered breach of parliamentary etiquette.

### *Majority Required in the Indian Parliament*

In the Parliament to pass the Legislative Bills, certain motions and resolutions certain majority is prescribed. They can be classified as simple or ordinary majority and special or extraordinary majority.

**Simple Majority (Ordinary Majority):** According to Article 100, 'all questions at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of the Houses shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting'. This means the majority of members who are present and voting.

For instance, on a given day in Lok Sabha let us assume 350 out of 543 members are present while the House is debating on a Bill. Of the 350 say 24 are participating in the debate and remaining 326 are only participating in voting, then the majority required to pass the bill is 326/2 plus 1 that is 164.

**Special Majority (Extraordinary Majority):** The constitution prescribes certain special majority for the passage of certain bills or carrying on certain motions. Such special majority are:

#### (i) **Impeachment of President**

This is the highest majority prescribed in the constitution for any proceeding. The resolution to remove the President needs to be supported by the two-thirds of the total membership of the House. For instance, in Lok Sabha the motion has to be supported by 364 members. The total membership of Lok Sabha is 543. Two-thirds of 543 means, 543 divided by 3 and the quotient multiplied by 2.

#### (ii) **Passage of Constitution Amendment Bills**

Article 368 (2) says a constitution amendment bill has to be passed by 'a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting'.

Here the constitution prescribes two-thirds of the total membership of the House present and voting as the special quorum for the House to take the bill for voting. If only the quorum is present the bill can be taken for voting. Then the Bill has to be supported by the majority of total membership of the House.

For instance, an amendment bill is in Lok Sabha, then  $543 \times 2/3$  that  $364$  members of Lok Sabha must be present and participate in voting. Only then the bill can be taken for voting by the House. Of that at least 273 members, the majority of total membership must support the Bill.

#### (iii) **Rajya Sabha resolutions**

The constitution prescribes that Rajya Sabha resolution is needed to be passed for say authorizing the Parliament to enact law on a matter in State subject and creation of a new All India Service. Such a resolution has to be passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting.

For instance, while considering such a resolution in the Rajya Sabha of the total 250 members 150 are present and voting, then out of them two-thirds that is  $250 \times 2/3 = 100$  members must support.

#### (iv) **Removal of Speaker, Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha and Deputy Chairman Rajya Sabha**

Effective Strength of the House = Total Strength of the House − Vacancy

```
Majority of all the then members = Majority of the Effective Strength
```

The Speaker or Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha may be removed from office by a resolution of the House passed by a majority of all the then members of the House.
