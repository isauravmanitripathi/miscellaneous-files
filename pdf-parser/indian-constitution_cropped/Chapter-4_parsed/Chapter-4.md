#### INTRODUCTION

Although India is a federation, the constitution defines India as 'Union of States'. The Union of India comprises 29 States and 7 Union Territories (UTs). The provisions of the constitution apply to all states and UTs uniformly, except for Jammu and Kashmir which enjoys a special status under the constitution.

## Territory of the Union

According to Article 1 of the constitution, the territory of India shall comprise:

- 1. The territories of the states.
- 2. The Union Territories.
- 3. Such other territories as may be acquired.

#### Do You Know?

- At the time of independence there were 600 units known as Indian or princely states.
- 216 states with a population of about 19 million merged into provinces.
- 61 states with a population of about 7 million were constituted into new centrally-administered units.
- 275 states with a population of about 35 million were integrated to create new administrative units, namely, Rajasthan, Madhya Bharat, Travancore-Cochin, Saurashtra and Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU).

According to Article 366 (15), 'Indian State' means any territory which the Government of the Dominion of India recognized as such a 'State'. The names of these states are mentioned in Schedule I of the constitution.

'Union Territory' means any UT specified in the First Schedule and includes any other territory comprised within the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule. [Article 366 (30)] There are seven UTs namely, Delhi, the Andaman and Nicobar Island, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Pondicherry and Chandigarh. Of these, Delhi and Pondicherry have their own legislative assemblies. Other five UTs are administered by the President through an 'Administrator' appointed by him and in accordance with the aid and advice of the union council of ministers.

According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, Territory of India also includes the territorial waters, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone or any other maritime zone of India with reference to the mainland of India as well as the individual or composite group or groups of islands constituting part of the territory of India.

#### Acquiring and Ceding of Territory

The power to acquire foreign territory and the power to cede any territory to a foreign nation are 'two essential attributes of sovereignty.'<sup>(1)</sup> 'The constitution contemplated changes of the territorial limits of the constituent states, not merely their reorganization and there was no guarantee of their territorial integrity.<sup> $(2)$ </sup> Therefore, the states in India do not have the 'Right to Territorial Inviolability'. Hence, Article 1 (3) (c) provides for the acquisitioning of territories.

However, according to Supreme Court, the acquisition of foreign territory is governed by international law and does not fall within Article  $1^{(3)}$  'Parliament has power only to pass law in respect of territory over which it has jurisdiction'.<sup>[4]</sup> Therefore, a foreign territory would not come under Article 1(3) (c) until there is legal transfer of territory to India, so as to constitute its 'acquisition' in international law.

 $^{(5)}$ Foreign territories which become part of India on acquisition may:

- Either be admitted into the Union or:
- Constituted into new states under Article 2 or;
- Merged into an existing State under Article  $3$  (a) or  $3$  (b) or;
- Formed into a UT.

Similarly, any part of Indian territory can be conceded to any other state or any adjustment of borders to settle border disputes is permitted under the constitution of India. The Union has the right to cede territory if and when the occasion arises. Such a right vest in every sovereign state and can be implied even when not specifically conferred by its constitution.

However, the cession of territory can be done only by legislation under Article 3 of the constitution. According to the Supreme Court in Berubari case, by implication, Article 1 (3) (c) does not exclude the power to cede national territory. This is because the power of acquisition expressly mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 excludes the power to cede.

The French ceded their settlements in Pondicherry, Mahe and Yanam in 1954, by the treaty of cession. These territories were administered as 'acquired' territories until 1962 as the French Parliament had not ratified the treaty of cession. After ratification, it was constituted as a Union Territory.

#### States Reorganization Commissions

- 1948: S. K. Dhar Committee, rejected linguistic reorganization.
- 1948: JVP Committee (Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, Pattabhi Sitaramayya), rejected linguistic reorganization.
- 1953: Fazl Ali Commission, recommended linguistic reorganization.

#### ADMISSION OR ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW STATES

Article 2, empowers the Parliament to:

- Admit into the Union or
- Establish new states

by law. 'Admission' refers to admitting of a state which has been already formed, established and is in existence. 'Establishing' a new state refers to admitting a territory into the Indian Union and forming a new state. Such state would not have existed before. In accordance with this provision, Sikkim was admitted as a new state into the Indian Union in 1976.

#### Admission of Sikkim

Before the Indian independence, Sikkim was a princely state ruled by the hereditary monarch Chogyal. At the time of independence, the people of Sikkim expressed willingness to merge with India. But the ruler was against the view and was interested in merging Sikkim with China. The strategic position of Sikkim was also an important reason for China to have interest in Sikkim.

#### State Reorganization Commission 1956: Approach

- 1. Linguistic homogeneity conducive to administrative convenience and efficiency.
- 2. Communicational, educational and cultural needs of the different language groups.
- 3. Continuing composite states:
  - If economic, political and administrative considerations are balanced.
  - With the necessary safeguards to ensure that all sections enjoy equal rights and opportunities.
- 4. Financial viability of the state to sustain.
- 6. Geographical contiguity of the states.
- 8. The commission rejected:
  - Concept of 'homeland' opposed to equal opportunities and equal rights for all citizens.
  - Theory of 'One Language' because:
    - A language can be spoken in more than one state.
    - People speaking different languages can be living in the same state.
    - o It could result in growth of parochial tendencies.

Once the British paramountcy ended, Sikkim and India entered into a treaty. India was responsible for the defence, external affairs and communication under the terms of the treaty. Government of India appointed a political officer to be represented in Sikkim. Thus, Sikkim became the Protectorate of India. In May 1974, the Sikkim Assembly passed the Government of Sikkim Act, 1974. The main features of the act were as under:

- Ending the monarchical rule and Chogyal made a constitutional head.
- Transferring all powers to Sikkim Assembly.

- Progressive realization of a responsible government for Sikkim as objective.
- To seek representation of people of Sikkim in the political institutions of India.

By the powers conferred by this law, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution that expressed the will for political and economic association with the India. It also sought for representation in Indian Parliament.

After the promulgation of the Government of Sikkim Act, the Chief Minister of Sikkim had made formal requests to the Government of India and requested to take such steps to give effect to the Government of Sikkim Act, 1974 particularly for providing representation for the people of Sikkim in Parliament.<sup>[6]</sup>

Subsequently, the Constitution (Thirty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1974 was passed. The main features of the amendment are:

- 1. Article 2A was inserted after Article 2 and Schedule 10 was added.
- 2. Sikkim became the 'Associate State' of the Indian Union.
- 3. One seat in the Council of States and one seat in the House of the People was allotted to Sikkim.
- 4. The representative of Sikkim in the Council of States shall be elected by the members of the Sikkim Assembly.
- 5. The representative of Sikkim in the House of the People to be chosen by direct election and for this purpose, the whole of Sikkim shall form one parliamentary constituency.

#### Major Bases for State Reorganization

- Geographical contiguity.
- Financial self-reliance.
- Administrative viability.
- Potential for development.
- Linguistic and cultural homogeneity.
- Preservation and strengthening of the unity and security of the nation.
- Financial, economic and administrative considerations.
- Planning and promotion of the welfare of the people in each state as well as of the nation as a whole.

These provisions were not in conforming to the original scheme of the constitution. The constitution had the provision for admitting a new state but not for an 'associate state'. Had the amendment been challenged in the Supreme Court, it would have been struck down as unconstitutional.

However, such eventuality did not occur and the criticism lost its relevance and significance within one year.<sup>(7)</sup> The Sikkim Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on the 10th April, 1975. The resolution noted that the Chogyal was indulging in the persistent harmful activities which not only violated the objectives of the Agreement of 1973, but also ran counter to the wishes of the people of Sikkim. They also impeded the democratic development and participation of people of Sikkim in the political and economic life of India. The Assembly solemnly declared that the institution of the Chogyal was abolished and Sikkim shall henceforth be a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible government. Subsequently, the Constitution (36 Amendment) Act was enacted. The amendment:

- 1. Repealed Article 2A and the tenth Schedule.
- 2. Admitted Sikkim as the twenty second state of India.
- 3. Inserted Article 371F providing for special provisions for Sikkim.

## FORMATION OF NEW STATE AND ALTERATION OF AREAS, BOUNDARIES OR NAMES OF EXISTING STATES

Article 3 empowers the Parliament to formation of new state and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing states. According to Article 3, Parliament can enact a law to form a new state by:

- Separation of territory from any state or; Uniting two or more states or parts of state or;
- Uniting any territory to a part of any state.

Also, the Parliament can enact law to:Increase the area of any state.

- Diminish the area of any state.
- Alter the boundaries of any state.
- Alter the name of any state.

Thus, the constitution provides for an 'indestructible union of destructible states'. This power is one of the non-federal features of the constitution because the consent or concurrence of the affected states is not needed. However, the power is liberally conferred on union government with reasons which are as follows:

- Indian federation is different from other federations and is unique. It is not formed by the alliance of compact and independent states. So, if the national interest demands, the union government must have the power to reorganize the states in accordance with the needs of the circumstances.
- The existing provincial organization at the time of independence was made by the British. Such organization was 'the result of accident and the circumstances attending the growth of the British power in India and partly a by-product of the historic process of the integration of former Indian states.'(8) But after independence, the states had to be organized according to the natural alignments.

#### Procedure

The procedure for the creation of new states or altering the names, area or boundary of any state is provided in Articles 3 and 4.

- 1. A bill to reorganize the state(s) can be introduced in either Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha. The bill is an ordinary bill.
- 2. The bill must be introduced only with the previous recommendation of the President.
- 3. The President must refer the bill to the legislatures of those states that will be affected by the reorganization before he recommends the introduction of the bill in the Parliament.
- 4. While referring to the legislatures of state, the President will prescribe the time period within which the states have to express their opinion on the bill.
- 5. The time limit prescribed by the President is binding on the legislatures of states and they must express their views within the said time.
- 6. The opinion of the state legislatures is not binding on the President. Even if the state expressed a negative view the President can introduce the bill.
- 7. On the introduction of the bill, the two Houses of the Parliament shall pass the bill and upon passage, the state(s) get reorganized.
- 8. Any amendment to Schedule I and the Schedule IV as a consequence of the reorganization of the state under Article 3 or admission of any state under Article 2 is not considered as an amendment for the purpose of Article 368. The law enacted for the purpose shall itself make the necessary amendments.

#### Application to Jammu and Kashmir

The provisions of Article 3 will not be applicable to the Jammu and Kashmir. According to article the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) order, 1954, no bill providing for increasing or diminishing the area of the State of Jammu and Kashmir or altering the name or boundary of that state shall be introduced in Parliament without the consent of the legislature of that state.

#### SMALLER STATES VS LARGER STATES: THE DEBATE

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Creation of smaller states and the consequent administrative, economic and developmental implication. *(IAS Mains 2011: Essay)*

Whether to have smaller states or larger states has been debated many a time. The debate was vibrant when Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand were created. However, both smaller states and larger states have their own merits and demerits.

#### Merits of Smaller States

- 1. When the state is smaller in size, it can lead to better administration because the geographic area to be governed is less.
- 2. Further, it will have more homogeneity which will improve the understanding of the needs, aspirations and problems of the people, so that the policy formulation and implementation becomes more rational and citizen-centric.
- 3. The homogeneity in the small states will improve social capital and trust, political consensus and increase the potential for the participation of common man.
- 4. Size of the government expenditure becomes smaller which in turn could reduce the possibility of corruption or atleast reduce the amount of corruption.
- 5. A small state will not have more powers to be hegemonistic as they will not enjoy high political clout. Larger states have at times attempted to use their political importance to hold the union government to ransom for their political demands and cater to their parochial tendencies. The union government had been left to embarrassment as they could not control the larger states. For instance, the union government had not been able to resolve the interstate river water disputes if it was between two larger states—Cauvery water dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is an example.
- 6. Uttar Pradesh, the largest state had attempted to bring the union government to a halt by pulling all its civil servants in the central deputation when there was a misunderstanding with the union government. This is remotely possible in case of a smaller state.
- 7. Economic backwardness was one of the important grounds for demanding smaller states. Lack of development since independence was the main reason for the demand for Telengana, which was formed in 2014. The demand for the formation of Vidarbha, Bodoland and Saurashtra, as separate states gained strength after the formation of Telengana. States like Punjab, Kerala are quoted as examples for the development of a state, when it is small.

However, the size of the state alone is not a reason for development. The North-Eastern states and states like Haryana which are small had not developed. On the contrary, states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka or Gujarat have shown remarkable development although they are larger in size. Kerala, being a small state has performed in the social development but in economic front its performance is not countable.

The growth and development of a state do not depend on the size of the state but several other factors. There should be scope for development in the state in terms of the resources, financial capability, human resources, etc.

Further, the style of governance is an important factor contributing to the development of the state. Although Tamil Nadu is one among the developed states in India today, the states has lost its place in the rank list of the industrialized states. But during 1960s Tamil Nadu was one of the top-ranking state in the list. In the post 1969 phase, the state came under the rule of the *Dravidian* parties which have not been as positive as it was before.

Another important factor contributing to the development of a state is the visionary leadership. To quote as an example Kamaraj as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu is remembered for his vision and making the state a topper in industrial growth. After him the visionary leadership is still at large.

To quote more, one can take the example of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, though these states are small, with relatively high social homogeneity and being blessed with natural resources, have been suffering from the left-wing extremism and are struggling to develop.

Hence, it is not the size of the state alone, a reason for the development, but is other important factors like the availability of resources and more specifically the style of governance and visionary leadership that bring development to a state.
