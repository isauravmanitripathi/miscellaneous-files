# INTRODUCTION

India has adopted the parliamentary form of government which requires that there must be dual executive titular and real. The English parliamentary democracy has a constitutional monarch acts as the titular head. Since, India did not have an emperor, the office of the President was established by the constitution. Article 52 establishes the office of the President of India. The President of India is part of Parliament and the head of the executive in India. $<sup>(1)</sup>$ </sup>

# President: Executive Head of the Government

The office of the President is modelled on the American and makes the President the executive head of the State. Article 53 provides that 'the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President'. It also makes the President the supreme commander of the armed forces. According to Article 53, 'the President shall exercise

the executive power either directly or through officers' subordinate to him, in accordance with the constitution'. In this article the following expressions need to be noted:

- (a) Executive power
- (b) Exercise the powers in accordance with the constitution
- (c) Exercise the powers directly
- (d) Exercise through officers' subordinate to him

#### *Executive Power: Meaning*

The term 'executive power' is not defined in the constitution. The constitution does not clearly demarcate what the executive powers of the President are. It has two characteristics namely:

- (i) Multidimensional
- (ii) Residuary in nature

The 'executive power' is *multidimensional* as it includes a variety of powers such as the power to draft and initiate legislations, adjudicate in certain cases, etc. It generally means all those powers required to carrying out the administration. It is impossible to define the executive power and draw up an exhaustive list of executive power.

It is in the nature of 'residuary' power. The constitution clearly demarcates the powers of the Parliament and the judiciary but it does not demarcate the powers of the executive. Residuary nature of the executive power refers to the powers that remain after removing the powers of the Parliament and the judiciary.

## *'Exercise the Powers in Accordance with the Constitution'*

In any case the constitution provides that the President has to exercise the powers only 'in accordance with the constitution'. It means that the President has to exercise his powers without infringing upon the constitutional provisions. Most importantly, the President has to exercise the powers:

- Without violating the fundamental rights
- With the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers
- Subjected to judicial review

In any case the President cannot go beyond the limits of the constitution. Therefore, it implies that the President cannot become a 'dictator' although the constitution vests in him all the executive powers of the Union of India.

#### *Exercise the Powers 'Directly'*

The expression means that the President can exercise his powers without the 'aid and advice' of the Council of Ministers. It does not mean that the President can apply his personal 'discretion' in exercising his powers.

**Circumstances in which President will act without advice of Council of Ministers:** There are certain circumstances in which the President will have to act without the advice of the Council of Ministers and exercise his powers 'directly'. Such circumstances are those in which the President has to:

- Comply with the conditions of the constitution.
- Apply his judgment to satisfy the requirements of the constitution.
- Apply his judgment to 'protect, preserve and defend' the constitution.
- Apply his judgment in his personal capacity.

#### *Exercise through Officers' Subordinate to Him*

The President can exercise his powers through officers who are subordinate him, that is, he can delegate his powers to any officer who he appoints under the Government of India. According to Article 77, the President is empowered to 'make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of India and for allocation among ministers of the said business'. It implies that the President has the power to create ministries and department, appoint and assign portfolios to the ministers. According to the Supreme Court, the term 'officers subordinate' includes the Council of Ministers also.

# Qualification to Office of President

Article 58 prescribes the qualification to the office of the President. To be elected as President of India any person must be a Citizen of India and have completed the age of thirty-five. He must also be qualified to be elected as a member of Lok Sabha. He must not hold any office of profit under any Government— 'Union, State or Local'.

Since the constitution does not specify the mode of acquiring of citizenship and prescribes only citizenship as qualification, even a person who has acquired the citizenship by any mode is eligible to be the President of India.

According to the explanation to Article 58, 'a person shall not be deemed to hold any office of profit' if he is:

- The President or;
- The Vice President or:
- The Governor of any State or;
- A minister either for the union or for any State.

# Election to the Office of the President

The President is elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of the:

- Elected members of both Houses of Parliament.
- Elected members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States [including National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Puducherry after the Constitution (70th Amendment) Act, 1992] (Article 54).

The nominated members of either House of Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies of State are not eligible to be included in the electoral college. Therefore, the Prime Minister will not be eligible for voting in the election to the office of the President, in case he happens to be a nominated member of Parliament. Thus, the President is elected indirectly and the citizens do not play any direct role in the election.

To contest in the election a candidate must be proposed by at least 50 members and must be seconded by at least another 50 members of the electoral college. The candidate is also required to pay a security deposit of  $\overline{515000}$ .

# *Manner of Election*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

- a) How are the President and the Vice President of India elected? What are the constitutional issues involved in their election? IAS MAINS – 1997
- b) Determine the 'value' assigned to the vote of a Member of a State Legislative Assembly and of a Member of Parliament in the Indian Presidential elections. IAS MAINS – 2012

The President is elected by the system of proportional representation and by means of the single transferable vote, exercised in a secret ballot (Article 55). The constitution mandates that as far as practicable 'uniformity in the scale of representation of the different States at the election' must be maintained. Towards maintaining this uniformity, the constitution provides for a special formula to calculate the value of the votes of the members of the Parliament and the state legislatures. The formula is based on the population of each State and the number of elected member of Parliament and of the Legislative Assembly of each State.

The value of the votes of the members of state legislatures and of Parliament is calculated in the following manner:

| Value of Vote of a member | Total Population of the State                                     |      |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| of Legislative Assembly   | <b>Total Number of Elected Member</b><br>in the State Legislature | 1000 |

FIGURE 11.1: Value of Votes of MLAs

| Value of Vote of Members | Sum of the value of the votes of the MLAs<br>of all States                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| of Parliament            | Total Number of Elected MPs in both the<br>Houses of Parliament in the State Legislature |

FIGURE 11.2: Value of Votes of MPs

According to Constitution 84th Amendment Act, 2001, the population of the States for calculating the value of votes of MLAs and MPs shall be the population of the 1971 census until the relevant population figures for the first census to be taken after the year 2026 have been published.

**Proportional Representation System:** System of proportional representation the election system under which any contestant who secures the necessary quota of votes is declared elected. The most common method of determining the quota is to divide the total number of valid votes cast by the total number of seats in the constituency plus one and adding one to the quotient. 'Supposing there are 100 valid voting papers and four seats are to be filled up. In order, therefore, to determine the quota 100 is divided by 4 plus 1, that is, 5 and the quotient arrived at, namely 20, is increased by one so that the quota is 21. After the quota is fixed, any candidate whose total number of first preference votes is equal to or exceeds the quota is forthwith declared elected. $(2)$

| Quota of Votes in    | Total valid votes polled |  |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--|
| President's Election |                          |  |

FIGURE 11.3: Quota of Votes

The proportional representation system prevents the minorities being excluded and they be represented adequately and effectively in all the political processes. It provides for the representation of the opinion of every section of the society. In the process the minorities do not get excluded. On the other side in the ordinary system of election which is known as 'first to past the post system', a candidate who secures maximum number of votes is declared elected. In the system although the votes polled by all other contestants is proportionately larger than the votes polled by the winner candidate.

**Single Transferable Vote System:** Single transferable vote means that each voter will have only one vote whatsoever number of candidates contesting in the election. In the election of the President each elector marks only his preference and does not vote for any one candidate alone. For instance, if there are four contestants in the election, then the elector indicates four preferences in succession as his first, second, third and fourth preference.

At the time of declaring results, the candidate who secures the quota of 'first preference' votes as calculated above will be declared elected. In case no candidate has secured the required quota of 'first preference' votes, then the candidate who secured the least number of votes is excluded from the election. After exclusion the votes polled by the excluded candidate is distributed among the rest of the contestants on the basis of the 'second preference' marked.

For instance, let us assume that there are four contestants namely, A, B, C and D. Of these D has received the least number of 'first preference' votes, then, he will be excluded. The electors who had preferred D as their first preference would have marked their second preference to A or B or C. Accordingly, the votes of the number of electors who had preferred A as their second preference would be added to the votes polled by A and so on to B and C respectively. This process is continued until any one of the contestants secures the required quota and emerges victorious.

Single transferable vote system helps avoiding multiple rounds of election. Since the President is elected by a proportional representation system, in case when no candidate secures the required proportional majority, it would require second round of elections. It would be unviable for India considering the costs—financial, administrative and other.

Although, the above procedure is established in accordance with the constitutional provisions and the President and Vice President Elections Act, the eventuality of applying this had not arisen until this date. As a matter of convention, the President of India is elected by means of consensus of all political parties—ruling and the opposition. This is to keep the highest constitutional office away from political controversies.

However, in 2002, when Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was fielded as the NDA candidate in the President's election, the Left parties refused to accept this convention on the ground that it was against the principle of democracy. Lakshmi Sehgal was fielded as the Left Party candidate. Further, former Chief Election Commissioner T. N. Sheshan also contested the election. Subsequently, in 2007 when Dr Kalam's term as President ended, there was a fierce contest to the office. Pratibha Devi Patil and the then Vice President Bairon Singh Shekawat had a fierce battle for the office.

The issue of whether the candidate in the presidential election can campaign for votes was raised during this election. It was settled that the candidate can campaign but, in that process, he must not use any of his official facilities, in case he was an incumbent in any office that does not prevent him from contesting the election, for example, Vice President. Also, he must not utilize the State/government facility that he may enjoy as an incumbent of the office he holds, for the campaign. It shall be funded and facilitated only by the party which fields the candidate or the candidate's own expense.

# *'Republic' and Manner of Election of the President*[3]

Although the President of India is not elected by the people directly, India is still a 'Republic'. The constitution prescribes certain conditions which injects the republican character into the constitution and makes it a truly republican constitution. The conditions are as follows:

- 1. The electoral college to elect the President includes the elected members of the State Legislative Assembles also.
- 2. A special formula has been prescribed to calculate the value of the votes of the MLAs and MPs.
- 3. The President is elected by a system of proportional representation.

**President's Election and Party whip:** Another important issue with regard to the election to the office of President is that whether the political parties can issue whip regulating the voting of the members of the electoral college. The members of electoral college do not exercise their own vote but on behalf of the people who they represent. Further they vote by secret ballot. Hence, the party whip will not be binding on them and so they will not be disqualified in case they vote against the whip. The Election

<sup>3</sup> Refer Chapter on Preamble for more details.

Commission had in July 2012 clarified this by its order.<sup>[4]</sup> In the clarification the commission mentioned that 'voting at election to the office of President is different from voting by a member of Parliament or state legislature inside the House and that, as held by the Supreme Court, the provisions of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India may not apply to the voting at the presidential election. A question arose before the Supreme Court in Kuldip Nayar versus Union of India (AIR 2006 SC 3127) whether the provisions of Tenth Schedule to the constitution would be attracted in the case of the election to the Rajya Sabha if a member of a State Legislative Assembly votes for a candidate in defiance of the party's directions, where the votes are now given by the system of open voting. The Supreme Court held that an elector would not attract the penal provisions of the Tenth Schedule for having so voted at the Rajya Sabha election.'

#### Do You Know?

- 1. Only ballot paper is used in the election to office of president.
- 2. There is no provision for nota in the president election.
- 3. The members of electoral college can choose the place where they will vote delhi or in any state capital.
- 4. Anti defection law will not apply to president election.

**Can Political Parties Abstain from the Election?:** The issue of whether the political parties abstain from voting in the President's election came up in 2007. According to the Election Commission, the parties have the right to decide regarding participating in the election to the office of President. Therefore, the parties have the right to abstain from the election.

This could be the legal position. But when one looks at the question on the moral grounds, parties by abstaining from the election the party loses its moral ground to be a representative of the masses.

#### *Eligibility for re-election*

The President is eligible for re-election. The explanation in Article 58 excludes the office of the President from being considered as an office of profit for the purpose of election to the office of the President. Further, Article 57 expressly provides that the President is eligible for re-election.

However, except the first President of India, Bapu Rajendra Prasad, no other President had chosen to contest for re-election. Hence, as a convention, it was considered that any President of India can have a maximum of two terms. Based on this convention in 2002, President Dr K. R. Narayanan, expressed the willingness to contest for the second term. However, the BJP headed National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government was unwilling to give him second term as he belonged to Congress party. It was argued that no President other than the first President chose to contest for the second term and so, it is an established convention that the President of India shall have only a single term.

As consequence, the Congress party demanded that the then Vice President Krishan Kant shall be given the chance to be the President. It was argued that elevating the Vice President to presidency is another established convention since the constitution came into force. Hence, it was demanded that the then Vice President Krishan Kant be elevated to the presidency. However, the NDA broke this convention and made Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam as the presidential candidate. Similarly, in 2012, the incumbent Vice President Dr Hameed Ansari was re-elected as Vice President setting a new convention.

Thus, it is now settled that the President of India shall have only one term as a convention and there is no need to elevate the Vice President to presidency.

<sup>4</sup> http://eci.nic.in/eci\_main1/current/PN1072012.pdf: Press note clarification on right to vote or not to vote.

#### *Disputes in Election*

Article 71 provides for the settlement of any 'doubts or disputes arising out of or in connection with' the election to the office of the President. The power to inquire on to any such disputes is vested in the Supreme Court. The decision of the court is final and no appeal lies against the order of the court. In case, the court sets aside the election to the office, the acts done by him in the exercise and performance of his powers or discharging his duties as President shall not be invalidated.[5]

Further, the Parliament is empowered to make law to regulate the election to the office of the President and Vice President. The election can be challenged only by a person who had been a candidate in the election and no public interest litigation in this connection is entertained. The election can be challenged only after the completion of the process of election. This means the process of election cannot be suspended in the middle. This is because Article 62 mandates that the election to the office must be completed with the time prescribed.

Constitution (11th Amendment) Act, inserted Article 71 (4), which provides that the election 'shall not be called in question on the ground of the existence of any vacancy for whatever reason among the members of the electoral college electing him'.

#### People Appointed by a Warrant Under the Hand and Seal of the President

- 1. Judge of Supreme Court (Article 124)
- 2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (Article 148)
- 3. Governor of a State (Article 155)
- 4. Judge of a High Court (Article 217)
- 5. Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and other Members of National Commission for the Scheduled Castes (Article 338)
- 6. Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and other Members of National Commission for the Scheduled Tribes (Article 338A)
- 7. Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and other Members of National Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (Article 338B)

# Oath of Office

Before entering upon the office, the President is administered an oath of office by the Chief Justice of India in accordance with Article 60. In case the Chief Justice is absent, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court available shall administer the oath.

According to Article 60, the President takes the oath to 'preserve, protect and defend' the constitution and 'devote to the service and well-being of the people of India'. It implies that the founding fathers of the constitution envisaged an important role to the President.

He is the 'friend, philosopher and guide' to the Council of Ministers. He is not a mere rubber stamp who merely endorses the decisions of the Council of Ministers. He has to guide the Council of Ministers whenever they crossed the limits set by the constitution. For instance, it is required of the President to direct the Prime Minster to submit any matter for the consideration of the Council of Ministers, if in the matter he was advised by a single minister and the matter was not considered by the Council as a whole.

Further, it is appropriate to recall that there are many instances in which the President is to act without the advice of the Council, 'exercise his powers directly'. This is to ensure that the administration is conducted in accordance with the constitution and not according to the political whims.

Thus, it is clear that the office of the President is not a mere ceremonial office although he is the titular head. Under certain circumstances the President plays a very important role. Especially when no party gains

<sup>5</sup> Article 71 (2).
majority in the election to Lok Sabha, President plays an important role in appointment of the Prime Minister. Similarly, when the incumbent Council of Ministers resign or lose the confidence of the House then the President an important role maintaining political stability and avoiding election being imposed on the people.

## Term of Office

The President shall hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office (Article 56). The incumbent shall continue to remain in office until his successor enters upon the office, even if his term as President has expired.

However, the term can terminate before the expiration of the said five years in the following circumstances:

- (i) If the President resigns, President resigns by writing under his hand addressed to the Vice President or;
- (ii) If the President is removed from office, President is removed by the process of impeachment as given in Article 61 or;
- (iii) If the President dies or;
- (iv) In otherwise, for instance, the Supreme Court set aside the election to the office of President.

### *Time of Holding Election to Office of the President*

Article 62, provides for the time of conducting the election to the office of the President. The office of the President can fall vacant if the term of office of the President expired or when in certain cases before the expiry of the term of office, casual vacancy.

The election to the office of the President must be conducted before the expiry of the term of the President. In case of a casual vacancy, vacancy due to the resignation, removal, and death or otherwise, the election has to be conducted before the expiry of six months from the date on which the vacancy occurred. In such cases the person elected as President will have a full five-year team from date on which he enters upon the office.

## Impeachment of the President

The procedure for the removal of the President is given in Article 61. The process of removing the President is a quasi-judicial process and is known as 'impeachment'.

The President can be removed only the ground of violating the constitution. The charges to remove the President can be preferred by either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. When the charge is preferred in one House, the other House will act as investigating House.

The proposal to the prefer the charges has to be submitted to the House subjected to the following conditions namely:

(i) The proposal must be signed by not less than one fourth of the members of the House;

(ii) The proposal can be moved only after a notice is served 14 days in advance

Once the proposal is moved and accepted by the House, the resolution preferring the charges must be passed by a majority of two-thirds of the total membership of the House. Once passed in the first House the charges against the President is said to have been preferred and the resolution is transmitted to the second House. The second House will act as an investigating House.

### **Connect**

Situations when the Vice President 'ACTS' as the President: In the event of the occurrence of any vacancy in the office of the President by reason of

- 1. death of the President or
- 2. resignation of the President or
- 3. removal of President from his office through impeachment or

4. otherwise – For instance if the Supreme Court sets aside the election of the President.

Situations when the Vice President 'discharges the functions' of the President and when the President is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other cause.

At the investigation, the President has the right to appear or be represented to defend him against the charges. This is in consonance with the principle of natural justice. If as a result of investigation, a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the House is passed then, the charges against the President is sustained and the President is impeached and stands removed.

# Conditions of Office

According to Article 59, the President shall not be a member of either House of Parliament or of a House of the legislature of any State. In case such a member is elected as President, his seat in the Parliament or the state legislature will automatically fall vacant once he enters upon the office of the President.

It implies that the constitution does not prohibit a member of Parliament or the state legislature to become the President but once he entered upon the office of the President, he is deemed to have vacated is seat in the legislature. $(6)$ 

The President is barred from holding any office of profit either in public or private organizations [Article 59 (2)].

The President is entitled to the use of his official residences without payment of rent. He is also entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law. The expenditures relating to the emoluments and allowances of the President and other expenditure relating to his office are charged upon the consolidated fund of India [Article 112 (3) (a)].

Further, the emoluments and allowances of the President shall not be diminished during his term of office. This means that the emoluments and allowances can be increased but cannot be reduced during his term of office.

# Powers of the President

According to Article 53, all the executive powers of the union are vested in the President. The executive powers of the President are multidimensional in character and it includes the powers of the nature of:

- Administrative powers
- Legislative powers
- Pardoning powers
- Military powers
- Diplomatic powers
- Miscellaneous powers

Although these powers are classified into many groups, they are executive powers of the President which he shall exercise only with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

**(a) Administrative Powers:** Administrative powers are those are required for the purpose of the making and implementing policy, law and administrating the departments of the government. The administrative powers include:

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'Article 78 of the Constitution confers Executive Power on the President'. Comment. IAS MAINS – Public Administration – 1998

- (a) The power to appoint and remove persons to various offices under the Government of India. All the constitutional offices such as Prime Minister, Council of Ministers, judges of Supreme Court and high courts, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, members of UPSC, etc.
- (b) Most of the incumbents, except a few such as the judges of Supreme Court and high courts, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, hold office during the pleasure of the President. For instance, the ministers of the union hold office during the pleasure of the President. [Article 75 (2)]. Therefore, the President also the powers to remove those who he appoints from office.
- (c) According to Article 77, the President has the powers to 'make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of the government'. He also has the powers to allocate the portfolios to the ministers. Exercising this power, the President has made the Allocation of Business Rules and Transaction of Business Rules.
- (d) Article 77 also empowers the President to create and abolish various ministries and departments.
- (e) According to Article 78, the President as the head of the State and administrative head, has the powers to:
  - Be informed about the decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the affairs of the union.
  - Call for any information relating to the administration of the affairs of the union.

These are the duties of the Prime Minster. Thus, Article 78 confers upon the President the power to supervise and call for report. These are some of aspects of the executive power.

#### **(b) Legislative Powers:**

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'Indian Constitution confers vast legislative powers on the President.' Comment.

IAS MAINS – Public Administration – 2000

The legislative powers of the President are the executive powers of legislative nature because such powers are exercised by the President in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. Also, they are subjected to judicial review.

'The constitution vests in the President vast legislative powers'. The legislative powers of the President are 'vast' because of the following reasons:

- The President is part of the Parliament. Article 79 provides that the Parliament of India shall comprise the President and two Houses namely, the Council of States and The House of People.
- The President is empowered to nominate members to both the Houses of the Parliament and thus, the President plays role in the composition of the Houses.
- The President at times plays the role of the Parliament. In circumstances, when the Parliament is not able to make law, the President is empowered to promulgate ordinances.
- There are certain bills like Money Bill which can be introduced in the Parliament only with the previous recommendation of the President. Similarly, when the bills are passed by both the Houses, they are presented to the President for his assent. Only upon his assent, the bills become a law.
- Also, the President has the powers to veto the bills and the Indian President enjoys three types of veto namely: 'Absolute, Suspensive and Pocket Veto'. Thus, the President plays an important role in the passage of bills, right from their introduction to the bills becoming a law.

Thus, the Indian Constitution vests in the President vast legislative powers.

### **Legislative Powers:**

- 1. **Article 79:** The President is part of Parliament.
- 2. **Article 80:** The President has the powers to nominate twelve members to be nominated from among the 'persons having special knowledge or practical experience in respect of literature, science, art and social service'.
- 3. **Article 331:** President has the powers to nominate two members of the Anglo-Indian community, if in his opinion the community is not adequately represented in the House of People.
- 4. **Articles 85 and 108:** The President has the power to summon and prorogue the Houses of the Parliament from time-to-time. However, he has to ensure that not more than six months expires between the last sitting of the previous session and the first sitting of the next session. He also has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, when the term of the Lok Sabha expires or whenever it is required and call for election.

Article 108 provides for the power of the President to convene a joint sitting of both the Houses of the Parliament to resolve the deadlock between the two Houses in respect of an Ordinary Bill.

5. Articles 86 and 87: Provides for the right of the President to address the Houses of the Parliament and send messages to the Houses. The President can address the Houses either separately or jointly. For the purpose he can require the attendance of the members.

The President also has the right to send messages to the Houses. Article 86 provides for the special address by the President. The first session after every general election to Lok Sabha and the first session of the Parliament every year begin with the President's address. The President informs the members the cause of the summoning of the Houses.

**Issues involved:** The President has to exercise these powers with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, since the constitution does not mention any condition. Hence, the address made by the President to the Houses is prepared by the government and the President ceremonially reads that out. The question of whether the President has the right to deviate from the text or is bound to read it verbatim was raised. It is now settled that the President can deviate and even he can express his views. The President being the 'first citizen' of the nation must be guaranteed with the right to speech and expression. Furthermore, his address being an official document, it shall not be used against him, for instance to impeach him.

Similarly, the right of the President to send messages to the Houses is also bound by the advice of the Council. As long as there is no difference of opinion between the President and the Council there will not any issue. However, if the Council had an opposite view on the message the President

n n n

wants to send to the Houses, then it will result in a deadlock. However, no such circumstance has till date arisen and therefore, the issue is not settled.

- 6. **Previous Sanctions to Bills:** Certain bills can be introduced into the Parliament only the previous recommendation of the President. Such bills are:
  - Bills relating to creation of new states or the alteration of the names, areas or boundaries of any existing State (Article 3).
  - The bill providing for compulsory acquisitioning or requisitioning of property under Article 31A.
  - Money Bills can be introduced only with the previous recommendation of the President (Article 117).
  - Any State Bills imposing restriction upon freedom of trade (Article 304).
  - Bills affecting taxation in which States are interested [Article 274 (1)].
  - A bill which, if enacted and brought into operation, would involve expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India shall not be passed by either House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House the consideration of the bill [Article 117 (3)].

**Need for Previous Sanction:** The founding fathers have incorporated the conditions for the previous sanctions deliberately due to the following reasons:

- The President is the friend, philosopher and guide to the Council of Ministers. Whenever, the Council acts with a political motive, the President can put a break and thereby preserve, protect and defend the constitution.
- The previous sanction of the President ensures that the bill will not suffer any delay or being vetoed by the President after it is passed by the Houses. Especially certain bills like money bills could not be delayed.
- Certain bills potentially impact the federal set-up of the constitution. 'Federation' being a basic feature of the constitution cannot be taken away. The central legislation must not be permitted to adversely impact the State interest.
- Under Article 78, the President needs to be informed about the affairs of the administration including the proposals for the legislations. The previous sanctions to certain legislations are a cautious measure to ensure the proposals for certain important legislations are informed to the President.
- It is also an extra cautious measure to avoid any contingency that may arise in future.
- 7. **Assent to Bills:** According to Article 111, after a bill passed by the Houses of the Parliament, it is presented to the President for his assent. When a bill is presented to him the President may:
  - Declare that he gives his assent, in this case the bill will become a law or;
  - Declare that he withholds his assent, it means the President has vetoed the bill and the bill is dead or;
  - Return the bill to the House in which it originated for reconsideration, with or without certain recommendations for amendment.

**Power of Veto:** Veto is an executive power to prevent any bill becoming a law. Normally all the modern constitutions confer this power upon the executive in order to prevent any unconstitutional matter getting passed as a law. There are four types of veto namely:Absolute veto

- (i) Qualified veto
- (ii) Suspensive veto
- (iii) Pocket veto

**Absolute Veto:** If the President declares that he withholds his assent to the bill presented to him, the bill is dead. The legislature cannot override this veto by any majority.

**Qualified Veto:** It is a veto that can be overridden by the legislature by an extraordinary majority (special majority) prescribed by the constitution or any law. In the USA, the presidential veto in certain bills can be overridden by the resolution of the legislature passed by a special majority. But in India this type of veto is not available.

**Suspensive Veto:** It is a veto that is overridden by a resolution passed by the legislature supported by an ordinary (simple) majority. The President of India enjoys this veto.

According to the proviso of Article 111, when the President returns a non-money bill for reconsideration of the House, the President is exercising his veto power. He declares that he will give his asset to the bill in the form in which it is passed by the House. In that case, the House needs to reconsider and pass the bill again. It is the discretion of the House to either accept the recommendations of the President.

Once reconsidered and passed, the bill is presented to the President for his assent. At this juncture, the President does not have any choice but only to give his assent. Since the constitution does not prescribe any special majority for this the presidential veto is overridden by an ordinary (simple) majority. Hence, this veto is known as suspensive veto.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:* Write a short note on Pocket Veto. IAS MAINS – GS – 2009 'The veto-power of the Indian President is a combination of the absolute, suspense and pocket veto.' Comment. IAS MAINS- Public Administration Paper II – 2005

**Pocket Veto:** It is not a veto in the true sense of the term veto. It is a consequential power. The constitution does not prescribe any specific time limit within which the President needs to declare his decision on giving assent to a bill. Therefore, it implies that the President can take any length of time to decide on the bill. When the President retains the bill with him without declaring his decision, it is known as the President 'sitting on the bill'. After the expiration of a considerable length of time, the bill may lose its relevance even if it comes to force and hence, it is almost dead. In such cases the President is said to have pocketed the bill. This is known as pocket veto.

# INDIAN PRESIDENT—A COMBINATION OF VETO POWER

The President of India enjoys a combination of veto powers. He possesses a combination of absolute, suspensive and pocket veto. He enjoys these veto powers in accordance with the type of the bill. This is an executive power which the President is to exercise with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

# Absolute Veto

The President enjoys absolute veto with respect to:

- (a) Ordinary Bills passed by the Parliament;
- (b) Money Bills passed by the Parliament;
- (c) Private Member's Bills;
- (d) Financial Bills passed by the Parliament;
- (e) State Bills reserved for his consideration.
- (a) **Ordinary bills passed by the Parliament:** The ordinary bills passed by the Parliament can be absolutely vetoed by the President, on the advice of the Council of Ministers. After passing a bill the circumstance could change and a need for abolishing the bill may arise. For instance, in Jammu and Kashmir the legislature passed a bill that took away the right to inherit property for the Kashmiri women who married non-Kashmiri men. This bill met with huge public opposition and the government could not go ahead. So, the government advised the Governor to absolutely veto the bill. In case this power to absolutely veto the bill is not available, it would require another law to replace it or to declare it invalid. That would be a cumbersome and expensive process. However, in practice absolute veto is usually exercised in case of Private Member's Bills. With respect to Government Bills, absolute veto is exercised in circumstances when the government resigns or removed.

| <b>Type of Bill</b>                 | <b>Absolute Veto</b> | <b>Suspensive Veto</b> | <b>Pocket Veto</b> |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| <b>Ordinary Bills</b>               | <b>Yes</b>           | Yes                    | Yes                |
| <b>Financial Bills</b>              | <b>Yes</b>           | Yes                    | <b>Yes</b>         |
| Money Bills                         | <b>Yes</b>           | N <sub>O</sub>         | Yes                |
| <b>State Bills</b>                  | <b>Yes</b>           | <b>Yes</b>             | <b>Yes</b>         |
| <b>Constitution Amendment Bills</b> | No                   | No.                    | No                 |

### **TABLE 11.1** Indian President: Veto Power

- (b) **Money Bills passed by the Parliament:** Although the Money Bills are introduced in the Parliament with the previous recommendation of the President, it does not bind the President to give his assent. Since, it is introduced on his recommendation he cannot return the bill for reconsideration. Article 111, expressly prohibits the President form returning the Money Bill for reconsideration. If he needs any clarification on the bill, he has to clarify at the stage of introduction itself.
- (c) **Private Member's Bills:** A bill introduced by the member who is not a minister is known as Private Member's Bill. The President absolutely vetoes the bill if the Council of Ministers advised him to veto the bill.
- (d) **Financial Bills passed by the Parliament:** Financial bills are Ordinary Bills for all the practical reasons of passage in the Parliament. Hence, such bills can also be absolutely vetoed.
- (e) **State Bills reserved for his consideration:** According to Article 200, the State Bills can be reserved for the consideration of the President. The Governor of the State is empowered to reserve the bills, including the money bills, presented to him for assent. According to Article 201, the President has the powers to veto the bills absolutely.

# Suspensive Veto

The President enjoys suspensive veto with respect to the Ordinary Bills including the Financial Bills of both the union and the States. In any case, the President cannot return a Money Bill for the reconsideration of the House.

#### First Time Veto Exercised by the President

- (a) Absolute Veto PEPSU (Patiala, East Punjab States Union) Appropriation Bill
- (b) Pocket Veto The Indian Post Office (Amendment) Bill, 1986
- (c) Suspense Veto exercised formally and Bill returned Office of Profit Bill 2006

## Pocket Veto

Since the constitution does not prescribe any time limit for the President to declare his decision, the President can retain any bill submitted to him. Thus, over a period of time the bill might lose its relevance and be dead. The postal amendment bill passed in 1984 was pocket vetoed the President.

## Constitutional Amendment Bills

After the 24th Amendment Act, 1971, the President does not enjoy any veto power with respect to the constitution amendment bills. Article 368 (2), makes it mandatory for the President to give his assent

### Recall Executive Powers of the President

- (a) He must be kept informed by the Prime Minister of all decisions of the Cabinet
- (b) He can ask the Prime Minister to submit a decision of any ministers for the consideration of the Council of Ministers
- (c) He must be supplied with such other information about the administration of the country as he asks for it
- (d) All-important appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Council of **Ministers**
- (e) The Prime Minister and all Union Ministers are appointed by the President
- (f) The President is the supreme commander of the Armed Forces
- (g) The initiation of legislation
- (h) The determination as well as the execution of policy

to the constitution amendment bill when passed by both the Houses of the Parliament and presented to him for his assent.

Thus, the President of India enjoys a combination of veto power.

#### 8. **Ordinance Making Power (Article 123)**

Article 123 confers upon the President the power to promulgate ordinances in certain circumstances/contingencies when the Parliament is not able to enact a law. 'If at any time, except when both the Houses of Parliament are in session, the President is satisfied that the circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate' ordinances.

**Safeguards:** The President can promulgate ordinances only on such matters on which the union Parliament is empowered to enact law. In case the ordinance is issued on any matter on which the Parliament does not have jurisdiction, then the ordinance is void [Article 123(3)].

Except when Both Houses of Parliament are in Session Means

- Lok Sabha in session, Rajya Sabha not in session
- Rajya Sabha in session, Lok Sabha not in session
- Lok Sabha dissolved, Rajya Sabha in session
- Both Houses not in session

Any ordinance promulgated must not infringe upon any fundamental right or violate any constitutional provisions and is subjected to judicial review.

A bill to replace the ordinance has to be placed before the Houses of the Parliament, before the expiry of six weeks from the date on which the House reassembles. In case the two Houses reassembled on different dates, then the six week is calculated from the date on which the second House reassembled.

The ordinance will continue to remain in force as a law, if the bill is approved by the Parliament. In case the Parliament rejected the bill or if the said six weeks period expired before the bill to replace the ordinance is presented, then the ordinance will lapse immediately.

While presenting the bill to replace the ordinance, the Council of Ministers submit a memorandum of explanation to House explaining the circumstances leading to the need for issuing the ordinance.

**Issues Involved:** With respect to the ordinance making power of the President the 'satisfaction' of the President and judicial review of the 'advice' tendered to the President are important issues.

n n n

In the Cooper's case the Supreme Court ruled that the presidential satisfaction to promulgate an ordinance is not the singular satisfaction of the President but the collective satisfaction of the Council of Ministers. Hence, the possibility of political motive and any *mala fide* is not ruled out. Therefore, the satisfaction of the President can be challenged and the ordinance is subjected to judicial review.

As a consequence, 38th amendment was enacted, which inserted Article 123 (4). The new clause laid down that the President's satisfaction is final and barred the intervention of the Court. However, the 44th amendment repealed the Clause 4 to Article 123. Thus, the Cooper's judgement is given a re-entry.

This gains significance in the context of the re-promulgation of the ordinances. Since the constitution is silent about the re-promulgation of the ordinances, an ordinance can be promulgated any number of times. However, after the Supreme Court ruling in the Coopers' case and 44th amendment it is curtailed to rarity and only under unavoidable circumstances the ordinances are repromulgated. The Supreme Court ruled that promulgation of ordinance must be regulated as the route enables the government to bypass the parliamentary accountability which is the chief feature of parliamentary democracy. If not regulated the ordinance making power will lead to 'ordinance *raj*' instead of Rule of Law.

In the Krishna Kumar versus State of Bihar (2017) case, the Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional if any ordinance is not placed before the House of legislature for approval. The constitution requires that any ordinance need to be replaced by a bill within six weeks from date of re-assembly. However, many a times the executive have chosen not to replace the ordinance with a bill. Instead the ordinance is allowed to lapse and it is re-promulgated. In Bihar an ordinance was promulgated for State taking over 429 Sanskrit schools in 1989. However, the ordinance was not replaced by a law and it was allowed to lapse from time-to-time and was re-promulgated. This was challenged and finally in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that:

- The Supreme Court has the power to check whether the ordinance making power has been exercised fraudulent or whether their power is abused. The scope of judicial review is expanded by the judgement. The Supreme Court ruled that the court has the power to ascertain whether the President or the Governor had any material and the relevance of the material based on which he was satisfied to promulgate the ordinance.
- It was unconstitutional when the bill to replace the ordinance is not tabled in the legislature.
- Ordinance is different from a temporary law enacted by the legislature. A law enacted by the legislature creates 'enduring rights and liabilities' (Doctrine of Enduring Rights), which means the rights granted or the liabilities imposed by the law will sustain even after the law expires. But in case of an ordinance this is not applicable. An ordinance is not created by the legislature but by the executive.

**Ordinance and Separation of Powers:** Separation of powers refers to the process of clearly demarcating the scope of the powers of the executive, legislature and the judiciary. In a parliamentary democracy the executive is vested with the power to promulgate ordinance as a contingency power. When the legislature is unable to enact a law in a circumstance requiring immediate action, the executive is empowered to take measure that is appropriate to the circumstance. But in any way, it is against the concept of separation of powers.

#### *Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

'Resorting to ordinance has always raised concern on violation of the spirit of separation of powers doctrine. While noting the rationales justifying the power to promulgate ordinances, analyse whether the decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue have further facilitated resorting to this power.' Should the power to promulgate ordinances be replaced? IAS Mains–GS – 2015
However, the past experiences clearly show that the power has been abused. The executive resorts to ordinance route when the executive is reluctant to face the legislature on certain issues or if they fear to face the vehement criticism of the opposition on the floor of the House. This negates the concept of parliamentary accountability and collective responsibility. Debates and discussions on the floor of the House is an essential feature of democracy. The executive ordinance does away with the essential feature of democracy.

**(c) Pardoning Powers:** All the modern constitutions confer the powers to pardon upon the executive. It is an executive power of judicial nature. It is vested in the President to correct any error that may occur in the judicial decisions for no human system is perfect. The pardoning powers of the President comprise a group of five powers, each having distinct significance and legal consequence namely:

- (i) Commutation
- (ii) Remission
- (iii) Respite
- (iv) Reprieve
- (v) Pardon

**Commutation:** It means to substitute one form of punishment with another punishment of lighter character. For example, reducing the death sentence to life imprisonment is commutation.

**Remission:** It means to reduce the amount of punishment without changing the character of the punishment. For example, it is to reduce the number of years of imprisonment to a convict.

**Respite:** It is to award a lesser punishment instead of the prescribed punishment in view of certain special reasons such as the age of the convict or pregnancy of a woman.

**Reprieve:** It is to stay the execution of a sentence during when the petition for pardon is pending before the President or the Governor.

**Pardon:** It absolves the offender from all sentences, punishments and disqualifications.

**Pardoning Powers of the President: Scope:** According to Article 72, the President can exercise the above powers with respect to any offence committed against the law enacted by the union Parliament. The President is the only authority who can grant pardon in respect of:

- (i) All cases in which the sentence is one of death;
- (ii) A sentence of a court martial.

The Constitution of India does not specify the manner in which the President to exercise the pardoning powers. He has to exercise the power only in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, like other powers. According to a series of decisions of the Supreme Court and of some high courts:[7]

- (i) The exercise of the power by the President under Article 72 is primarily a matter for his discretion and the courts would not interfere with his actual decision on the merits.
- (ii) But courts exercise a very limited power of judicial review, to ensure that the President considers all relevant materials before coming to his decision.
- (iii) The President can, in the exercise of this power, examine the evidence afresh. In doing so, he is not sitting as a court of appeal. His power is independent of the judiciary. He can, therefore, afford relief not only from a sentence which he regards as unduly harsh., but also from an evident mistake.
- (iv) The President is not bound to hear a petitioner for mercy before he rejects the petition.

**RA 80** 

<sup>7</sup> As given in Constitution of India: P. M. Bakshi, Thirteenth Edition Page 128, Nanavati versus State of Bombay, AIR 1961 SC 122, Ramanajah versus Superintendent, Central Jail, AIR 1974 SC 31.

**President's Power to Pardon Death Sentence:** With respect to the need for the power to pardon death sentence, the Law Commission of India, in its Report on Capital Punishment (1967), noted, 'there are many matters which may not have been considered by the courts. The hands of the court are tied down by the evidence placed before it'. The commission noted that whenever justice and humanity demanded, mercy must be shown. After all, 'law is made for man and justice is much more than mere codes and precedents'.[8]

'A sentence of death passed by a court after consideration of all the materials placed before it may yet require reconsideration because of:

- (i) Facts not placed before the court.
- (ii) Facts placed before the court but not in the proper manner.
- (iii) Acts discovered after the passing of the sentence.
- (iv) Events which have developed after the passing of the sentence.
- (v) Other special features. $'^{(9)}$

However, the commission also noted that to codify these special features would be impossible. Noting these reasons, the commission chose not make any recommendation to change in the scope of the powers.

In the Gowru Venkat Reddy case, the Supreme Court ruled that granting of pardon does not overturn the verdict of conviction but it only sets aside the punishment for the crime. It only eliminates the effect of conviction but without addressing the convict's guilt or innocence.

**Considerations to be Taken into Account:** Presidential clemency on death sentence is a prerogative of the executive and it must not be taken in a purely legal sense alone because it involves 'several ethical and social implications'. President must exercise this prerogative only in accordance with the rule of law and justice. It must not be driven by sentiments.

According to Law Commission, it must be based on 'want of premeditation, age, mental or physical condition of the offender, past conduct, external pressures which might have impaired independent judgment, medical abnormality falling short of legal insanity and so on'.<sup>[10]</sup> If any new evidence is discovered that must be taken into consideration.

According to Justice Arjit Pasayat and Justice S. H. Kapadia, 'caste, religion and political loyalty are must not be the considerations, for these are discriminatory'. Rule of Law is based on 'certainty of a law and fairness' which must not be compromised for political expediencies.

Conforming to this view, the executive has to declare the decision on a petition of mercy within a reasonable time. Any inordinate delay in the decision is considered to be against the public interest and the court has the power to review and grant relief to the victim.

Further, the power is not granted only to benefit the convict. Hence, while exercising the power the executive must consider the effect of the decision on the victim's family in particular, society in general and the precedent it would set for the future.

The power is not a privilege but a constitutionally mandated official duty of the executive. Hence, any discretion applied in the exercise of the power must be towards the welfare of the people and not only to benefit the convict. The executive is accountable to the people and so it be exercised only on the 'public considerations'.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Discuss the question of death sentence and presidential clemency. IAS MAINS – GS – 2003

'The exercise of executive clemency is not a privilege but is based on several principles, and discretion has to be exercised in public considerations.' Analyse this statements in context of the judicial powers of the President of India. IAS MAINS – GS – 2011

<sup>8</sup> Law Commission Report on Capital Punishments: 1967.

<sup>9</sup> Law Commission Report on Capital Punishments: 1967.

<sup>10</sup> Law Commission Report on Capital Punishments: 1967.

Hence, the executive decision to grant pardon is subjected to judicial review and the courts have the power to declare a decision to pardon invalid in case the decision was *mala fide*.

Thus, the exercise of executive clemency is not a privilege but is based on several principles, and discretion has to be exercised in public considerations.

**Decision on Pardon: Should a Time Limit be Prescribed?:** In the recent times the power of the President to grant pardon has become subjected to severe criticism on yet another ground of 'inordinate delay' in making a decision on the petitions for pardon. This has raised the demand for setting a time frame for the President to make a decision on such petitions. The arguments placed in favour of setting a time frame are as follows:

Firstly, any delay in disposing the petition for pardon results in causing anguish and suffering of the convict who waits for the decision.

Secondly, the waiting for the presidential decision on his petition for pardon a convict sentenced to death suffers from a serious mental agony. When after a long delay if the President rejects granting pardon and upholds the death sentence, the suffering of the convict is manifold. This amounts to a double jeopardy.

Thirdly, an inordinate delay is a clear violation of Article 21. The Right to Life guarantee by Article 21 is not a mere 'animal existence' but a right to live with human dignity. This right has to be guaranteed to every person within the territory of India until he is alive and his last breath. The inordinate delay in the decision on pardon violates this.

Fourthly, the power is not a privilege that President enjoys but an official duty which he discharges with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. The advice of the Council in this regard is binding on the President. Hence, one cannot rule out political motive in withholding the decision on a petition for pardon in certain cases. In the past there have been several cases in which the executive clemency was granted on political grounds. Epuru Sudhakar case in which the Supreme Court set aside the commutation granted by the then Andhra Pradesh Governor on the ground that it was granted on political expediency.

Similarly, the President Pratibha Devi Patil granted 28 pardons out of 30 petitions and 22 out the 28 related to brutal crimes such as murdering children, rape and murder of children. It is unclear why the President granted pardon to such criminals who indulged most heinous crimes within such short span of time.

The above arguments make it clear that there must be a reasonable time spent on making decision on the mercy petition. The very idea of vesting the pardoning powers in the executive is to ensure law to be a tool of reform. Pardoning goes beyond reforming a convict but redeeming him into the society. It is essential that the President exercises the power with utmost care and reason. Hence, it becomes reasonable to set time frame for the President to make the decision.

**Arguments Against Time Frame:** First of all, the power to pardon under Articles 72 and 161 are to executive powers to be exercised on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The Council might have to focus on many issues that are more pressing and the delay could be unavoidable. Although the decision on the petitions for pardon is essential the regular executive and legislative functions for securing the welfare of the citizens assumes the natural priority. Further, Article 74 (2) expressly lays down that the advice given by the Council to the President is beyond judicial review.

Though the arguments for and against setting a time frame for the President are placed, the spirit of a democratic welfare state demands that the State must be 'just, fair and reasonable' in the exercise of the powers conferred by the constitution.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Instances of President's delay in commuting death sentences has come under public debate as denial of justice. Should there be a time specified for the President to accept/reject such petitions? Analyse. IAS MAINS – GS Paper II – 2014

**RA 80** 

**(d) Military Powers:** According to Article 53 (2), the President is the supreme commander of the armed forces and the exercise of this power is regulated by the law. Thus, the President is only authority who can declare war and peace.

# VICE PRESIDENT

Article 63 of the constitution provides that, 'there shall be a Vice President of India'. The office is modelled on the lines of the Vice President of the USA. The office is needed for dealing with any contingency that arises due the temporary inability of the President to discharge his duties or when there occurs a vacancy in the office of the President.

## Do You Know?

- (1) Constitution is silent about who will perform the duties of the Vice President when casual vacancy occurs.
- (2) Constitution is silent who will perform the duties of the Vice President when he acts as President.

This is because the constitution does not confer any function on the Vice President.

According to Article 65, 'in the event of the occurrence of any vacancy in the office of the President by reason of his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise, the Vice President shall act as President until the date on which a new President elected'.

'When the President is unable to discharge his functions owing to absence, illness or any other cause, the Vice President shall discharge his functions until the date on which the President resumes his duties' [Article 65 (2)].

During when the Vice President is so acting as, or discharging the functions of, the President, he shall:

- Have all the powers and immunities of the President.
- Be entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law.
- Not perform the duties of the office of Chairman of the Council of States and shall not be entitled to any salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of the Council of States under Article 97.

During normal times when such a contingency had not arisen, the Vice President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. As the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Vice President is entitled to such salaries and allowances fixed by Parliament by law.

# **Oualification**

Article 66 lays down the qualification for the office of the Vice President. Accordingly, to be elected as Vice President a person must:

- (a) Be a citizen of India.
- (b) Have completed the age of thirty-five years.
- (c) Be qualified for election as a member of the Council of States.
- (d) Not be holding any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State or under any local or other authority subjected to the control of any of the said governments.

The following are exempted from being an office of profit for the purpose of being elected as Vice President namely:

**RA 80** 

- (a) President or;
- (b) Vice President of the Union or;
- (c) Governor of any State or;
- (d) Minister for the Union or for any State.

# Election of Vice President

The Vice President is elected by an 'electoral college consisting of the members of both Houses of Parliament in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote and the voting at such election shall be by secret ballot' (Article 66).

In the original constitution it was provided that the election will take place in a joint sitting of both the Houses. However, by the 11th amendment 1961, the provision for joint sitting was removed.

The Vice President shall not be a member of either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha or any state legislature. In case a member of Parliament or a state legislature is elected as Vice President, his seat in the House will fall vacant automatically, on the date on which he enters upon the office of the Vice President. This implies that the constitution does not bar a member of Parliament or a state legislature form contesting the election to the office of Vice President. $[12]$ 

# Term of Office

The Vice President will hold office for a term of five years from the date on which he enters upon the office (Article 67). This means that with respect to the Rajya Sabha, the Chairman will have a term of five years whereas the members will have term of six years.[13] However, the Vice President will continue to hold the office even after his term expires until the next Vice President enters upon the office. The office of the Vice President may fall vacant before the expiry of the term by reason of his death, resignation or removal.

The Vice President can resign from office by writing under his hand, addressed to the President. He can be removed from office by a resolution of Rajya Sabha supported by a majority of all the then members and agreed to by the Lok Sabha. Since the electoral college electing the Vice President includes the members of Lok Sabha, it is essential that the resolution to remove him needs to be agreed to by the House.

## *Majority for his Removal*

The expression 'majority of all the then members' in Article 67, means the 'Effective Majority' or 'Absolute Majority'. It means the majority of the total members of the House from which the total number of vacancies on the said date must be excluded. Hence, it is the majority of the effective strength of the House. Since it excludes the vacancy it is the majority of the House in its absolute terms and hence, known as absolute majority.

> Effective Strength of the House = Total Strength of the House – Vacancy Majority of all the then members = Majority of hte Effective Strength

## FIGURE 11.5: Effective Strength

For instance, on a given date there are 20 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha, the effective strength will be 230, which total strength (250) minus the vacancy (20).

Article 67 (b) lays down that the Vice President the proposal for his removal can be taken by the House only after serving a notice fourteen days in advance to the Vice President.

<sup>12</sup> The statement is a potential question for Prelims as this has been asked with respect to Governor. 13 *Ibid..*

According to Article 68, the election to the office of Vice President must be completed before the expiration of the term of his office. In case of occurrence of a casual vacancy, the election must be completed as soon as possible. Like for the President the constitution does not prescribe any time limit. According to the President and Vice President (Election) Act, it has to be completed within three months from the date of occurrence of such vacancy.
