# Preamble and The Philosophy of The Constitution CHAPTER<sup>3</sup>

## *Learning Objectives*

#### *After reading this chapter, you will be able to:*

- • Understand the purpose/significance/ relevance/utility of the Preamble
- Know why the Preamble is unique feature of Constitution of India
- Understand the philosophy of the Indian constitution
- Define the importance of the 'adjectives' to the word republic in the Preamble
- Learn the concepts of socialism, secularism and democracy

The Preamble is a sort of introduction to the constitution and is very helpful to understand the policy and intend of the constitution. It is an embodiment of all ideals and aspirations of the constitution. Preamble reflects the ideals embodies in the objective resolution of the constituent assembly which was adopted by the constituent assembly on January 22 1947. It contains the theme or philosophy of the constitution and is the essence of the constitution.

Traditionally, the Preamble was considered as a separate entity and not to form a part of the constitution. Even the Supreme Court of India, in the Berubari case ruled that the Preamble was not a part of the Indian constitution. However, the view was reversed in the Kesavananda Bharati case, in which the court ruled that Preamble was part of the constitution.

#### Do You Know?

In the constituent assembly debates on Preamble:

- H. V. Kamath wanted the Preamble to begin with 'In the name of God'.
- Shibban Lal Saksena and Pandit Govind Malaviya wanted the Preamble to begin with expressions such as 'By the grace of the Supreme Being, Lord of the universe, called by different names by different peoples of the world'.

### Purpose/Significance/Relevance/Utility of the Preamble

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

- 1. What is the significance of a Preamble to a constitution? Bring out the philosophy of the Indian polity as enshrined in the Preamble of the Indian constitution. *(IAS Mains 2004)*
- 3. 'The Preamble to the constitution is a key to open the minds of the makers.' Comment.

*(IAS Mains 1997)*

The Preamble to the constitution serves the following purposes namely:

- It indicates the sources of all power from which the constitution derives its authority.
- It contains the enacting clause that brings the constitution to force.
- It declares the aims and aspirations of the people.
- It declares the objectives and purposes of the constitution.
- It contains the philosophy of the constitution.
- It declares the rights and freedom that the people are entitled and intended by the constitution.
- It helps the interpretation of the constitution whenever there arise a conflict between the two provisions or if certain provisions are ambiguous. In the Berubari case the Supreme Court has held this view. Further in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Chief Justice observed that, 'The Preamble of our constitution is of extreme importance and the constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble.' For example, Part III (fundamental rights) has been given utmost safeguard and sanctity which no other part of the constitution enjoys. The reason for this could be understood when one reads Part III along with the Preamble. Preamble declares 'dignity of individual' as the objective of the constitution and hence, Part III has been accorded such high significance. This reflects the minds of the framers of the constitution.

#### PREAMBLE: A UNIQUE FEATURE OF CONSTITUTION

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Why is the Preamble to the Indian constitution considered as a unique feature? What are its main objectives? *(IFS Mains 2016)*

According to the Supreme Court, 'A glance over the Preambles of all constitutions all the world over will show that both in ideas and ideals and in expression, ours is unrivalled. It embodies the spirit of the constitution, determination of the Indian people to unite them in a common adventure of building up a new socialist, secular nation'.<sup>[1]</sup>

- The objectives specified in the Preamble contain the basic structure of our constitution.
- The cornerstone of Indian culture is pluralism and Indian secularism is built on the foundation of religious tolerance.
- Preamble declares the commitment of Indian constitution to the ideal of a welfare state by establishing socio-economic justice. According to Acharya Kripalani 'The Preamble contains the mystic principle of a welfare state.'
- The right to social and economic justice envisaged in the Preamble are elongated in the fundamental rights and 'Directive Principles of the Constitution' are to make the equality of the life of the poor, disadvantaged and disabled citizens of the society, meaningful.

<sup>1</sup> Excel Wear vs Union of India case, 1978 AIR 25, 1979 SCR (1) 1009

• India is committed to democracy and respects individual liberty, providing to all her citizens, the equality of status and opportunity. The Directive Principles of State Policy involving social, economic, political and cultural goals are like instructions to the state. They, aim at establishing a welfare state in India.

#### AMENDABILITY OF THE PREAMBLE

In the Berubari case the Supreme Court held that the Preamble was not a part of the constitution. According to the court, the Preamble cannot be a source of any powers. The powers of the organs of administration are conferred on them by the express provisions of the constitution. Hence, it was considered that the Preamble could not be amended using the provisions of Article 368.

However, the court reversed its position in the Kesavananda Bharati case, 1973. The court held that the Preamble of the constitution is more important than the Preamble of an ordinary law.

Subsequently, the Preamble was amended by the Constitution 42 Amendment Act, 1976. The terms 'socialist, secular, unity and integrity of nation' were added to the Preamble.

#### PREAMBLE AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA

Philosophy of the constitution refers to the basic beliefs, values and concepts of the Constitution of India. They are the basic values and principles which the constitution prescribes for governing the nation.

![](_page_2_Figure_8.jpeg)

#### Unity and Integrity of the Nation

Unity and Integrity of the people of India is an essential feature for maintaining the independence of the country. Given the diverse nature of the nation, those factors which contribute for the diversity such as multi-ethnicity, multi-language, etc. can become divisive forces. Hence, unity is a fundamental requisite. Also, unity among the people is essential for the successful operation of the democracy as the constitution prescribes democracy to be adopted as an individual value. However, the original constitution did not have the word "integrity". The words 'socialist, secular and integrity' were added in the Preamble, by the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1976. This is in a way an objective of the Indian constitution.

#### Dignity of Individual

The constitution guarantees every citizen of India 'the right to live with human dignity which means a life that is free from exploitation'.<sup>[2]</sup> This creates a constitutional obligation for the state that the fundamental right of any person must not be violated. This becomes all the more important in case of the weaker, vulnerable and marginalized sections. This is the philosophy that explains the objective of the fundamental rights.

#### **Fraternity**

Fraternity is essential to ensure the twin objectives of 'dignity of individual' and 'unity of the nation'. Given the heterogeneity of the population, the spirit of brotherhood (fraternity) is essential for integrating the people and the democratic system. Without spirit of fraternity, democracy will not be complete and will be hollow. Infusing the spirit of brotherhood is basic essential in the multi-ethnic, multireligious and multilinguistic Indian society is fraught with multiple problems, social ills like untouchability and divisive forces. The UN Human Rights Declaration proclaims that 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.'

#### **Equality**

The fullest development of an individual necessitates conditions of equality of status and opportunity. Without equality the rights guaranteed would be meaningless. The concept of equality envisaged by the founding fathers of the constitution is of wide scope. It is not merely mental and physical equality, but it is the equality of the status of free individuals and equality of opportunity.

Equality of the status of free individuals requires that all forms of inequality in the social structure be eradicated. Towards this the constitution makes all discriminations, on ground of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. According to M. V. Pylee, equality of opportunity implies the availability of opportunity to everyone to develop his potential capacities. In addition, the constitution also provides for political equality by way of universal adult franchise. All citizens of India who have completed the age of 18 have the right to vote. Further, Article 325 prohibits any discrimination of the citizens from being excluded in the electoral roll on the grounds of 'religion, race, caste, sex or any of them'.

#### Liberty

Liberty and equality are complimentary. Without guaranteeing rights, equality cannot be established. Guaranteeing rights is central to democracy. Liberty signifies the:

- The freedoms of any individual are not restrained arbitrarily.
- Presence of the conditions essential for the fullest development of the individual.

<sup>2</sup> Supreme Court of India - Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India case AIR, 1978 SC 597

#### **Justice**

Justice implies a harmonious reconcilement of the individual conduct with the general welfare of the society. Attaining the common good is the quintessence of 'justice'. It embraces the social, economic and political spheres. The expression 'justice, social, economic and political' while not committing this country and the assembly to any particular form of polity coming under any specific designation, is intended to emphasize the fundamental aim of every democratic state in the present day.[3] As mentioned by Jadubana Sahaya<sup> $(4)$ </sup> in the constituent assembly debates, justice refers to create a social order in which 'the community will own what belongs to the community by the gift of nature'.

#### **Connect**

Social justice enables the courts to uphold legislation:

- To remove economic inequalities.
- To provide a decent standard of living to the working people.
- To protect the interests of the weaker sections of the society.
  - 1. Reference: Supreme Court: Lingappa versus State of Maharashtra.
  - 2. Nakara versus Union of India.
  - 3. Sadhuram versus Polin.

#### *Social Justice*

Three judges' bench of the Supreme Court in the Air India Statutory Corporation versus United Labour Union and others case explained the concept of social justice as follows:

'Social justice, equality and dignity of person are cornerstones of social democracy. Social justice and equality are complementary to each other so that both should maintain their vitality. Rule of law, therefore, is a potent instrument of social justice to bring about equality in results. Social justice consists of diverse principles essential for the orderly growth and development of personality of every citizen. Social justice is not a simple or single idea of a society but it an essential part of complex social change. The constitutional concern of social justice, as an elastic continuous process, is to transform and accord justice to all sections of the society by providing facilities and opportunities to remove handicaps and disabilities with which the poor, etc., are languishing. It aims to secure dignity of their person. 'Social justice' is thus an integral part of justice in the generic sense. Justice is the genus, of which social justice is one of its species. Social justice is a dynamic device to mitigate the sufferings of the poor, weak, *dalits*, tribals and deprived sections of the society and to elevate them to the level of equality to live a life with dignity of person.'

#### *Economic Justice*

It is to establish a 'welfare state' by promoting economic democracy as envisaged by the Directive Principles of State Policy. It is the ideal of promoting equality by way of removing inequality in status and of the opportunity. This is essential for removing the difference between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'.

#### *Political Justice*

There should not be any arbitrary discrimination of any person with respect to participating in the political processes. The access to political system/institutions to all persons shall be free. Constitution seeks to achieve this by granting 'universal adult franchise'.

#### Republic

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

Discuss each adjective attached to the word 'Republic' in the 'Preamble'. Are they defendable in the present circumstances? *IAS Mains (GS: 2016)*

Republic implies that the head of the state be elected by the people and the state is not subordinated to external authority. According to Madison, 'Republic, means that form of government in which the ultimate power is vested in the people. People elect a set of men from among themselves and vest in them all authority to govern them so as to ensure smooth and harmonious life'. Hence, unlike in a democratic government in a republican government the head of the state has to an elected one, especially elected by the people directly.

Although the President of India is elected, he is not elected directly but indirectly by the members of Union and state legislatures. Hence, the critics are of the view that the term 'Republic' in Indian constitution is redundant and irrelevant. However, this view is not acceptable. The constitution prescribes certain conditions which injects the republican character into the constitution and makes it a truly republican constitution. The conditions are as follows:

- The electoral college to elect the President includes the elected members of the state legislative assembles also.
- A special formula has been prescribed to calculate the value of the votes of the members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and members of Parliament (MPs).
- The President is elected by a system of proportional representation.

By including the members of the state legislative assembles in the electoral college the lopsided result in the election to the office of the President is avoided and republican character is retained. About half of the population of India are settled in few larger states such as UP, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. If one counts the number of seats in the House of People allocated to these states he can understand that the count is 278. This is more than 50% of the strength of the House. So, if the electoral college comprised of only on the members of the Parliament then, only these large states will have the upper hand and the smaller states will be neglected. It will be worse in case of the North-eastern states as those states get more alienated.

The MPs and MLAs vote on behalf of the people in the election to the office of the President. Since the President is the representative of the entire population of the country, the value of the votes of the members of the electoral college must be calculated based on whole population of the country. Moreover, the size of the constituencies, both in terms of geographic size and population is not uniform. Therefore, in order to bring about uniformity throughout the nation the special formula is prescribed by the constitution. The system of proportional representation makes the President the representative of not only the nation but also the people.

#### Socialism and Democracy

The true spirit of the Constitution of India demands that the concept of socialism and democracy need to be viewed together. The original constitution did not have the express mention of 'socialism'. The term 'Socialist' was inserted in the Preamble by the Constitution (42 Amendment) Act, 1976.

The concept of socialism for Indian constitution is different from the meaning it assumes elsewhere. Indian constitution does not create a 'socialist state' which will have the complete control over the means of production and factors of production. Instead the constitution envisages a social order that is based on the socialistic morals and objective of 'egalitarianism'. Founding fathers of the constitution envisaged to create 'social order based on justice'—'Article 38, state to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people'. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru interpreted this as 'Democratic Socialism'.
#### **Connect**

- 1. Socialism is not identical with planning.
- 2. Socialism is not equal to nationalization and statism.
- 3. Statism is repugnant to economic democracy, because it makes the state the employer in at industrial or other business undertakings.

Socialism in the Indian context does not mean collectivism or complete nationalization of all means of production. India assumes the goal of socialism to usher into an egalitarian society through democratic means. Constitution of India seeks to build a socialistic pattern of society in which democracy is inculcated as a value. The role envisaged for the state in this is to facilitate the process.

Indian constitution views democracy not only from political standpoint but also from social and economic standpoints. In the socialistic order envisaged, equality and equity will be assured to every individual by providing unconditional 'right to access' to all institutions—social, political and economic. This will be possible only by democratizing all institutions. Only such a society can be an egalitarian society.

Establishing 'justice—social, political and economic,' is a prerequisite for ushering in such a social order. Establishing such a social order is essential for securing the dignity of individual.

Given the multidimensional character of Indian society with certain evil practices like untouchability, discrimination, differential and preferential treatments were socially accepted. As a consequence, the 'right to access' to institutions were denied. This, in turn, had rendered a section of the society weak, vulnerable and suffers from certain 'undeserved wants'. To set this right and achieve egalitarianism, a democratic social order is needed and the constitution seeks to achieve this by ushering in a 'socialistic pattern of society'. To create 'socialistic pattern of society', the constitution envisages a voluntary socio-economic reorganization. Hence the constitution prescribes democracy more as a 'value' - individual, social, economic and political. The following figure provides a representation of 'socialistic pattern of society' as envisaged by the Constitution of India.

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:*

The word 'socialist' in the Preamble to our constitution requires to be defined. Comment.

*(IAS Mains 1994: Public Administration Paper)*

The use of word 'socialist' in the Indian constitution has become redundant in the context of liberalization of economy. Comment.

*(IAS Mains 2001: Public Administration)*

## *'Socialist'- Has it Become Redundant?*

There is a view that the use of word 'socialist' has become redundant in the context of the liberalization of Indian economy after 1992. There is also a view that the word 'socialist' in the Preamble to our constitution requires to be defined. These views are put forward because the reforms under the New Economic Policy provided for the minimal role of the state and bring forth the concept of 'free market'.

An increased role of market and private players in providing the goods and services to the people is advocated. The concept of 'minimum government and maximum governance' is being put forward. The government is expected to give way to the private players in supplying goods and services with assured 'value for money', wherever it is possible. The role of the government is only to regulate and

n n n

![](0__page_7_Figure_1.jpeg)

ensure that services are promptly provided, create appropriate economic climate, for example, maintaining fair competition, preventing cartelization, etc. This is known as 'rollback of state' giving way to the market.

In the liberalized market the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) enjoy more autonomy and are expected to make profits like the private. The budgetary support to the PSUs is no more available. The PSUs are to compete in the market with the private players and their monopoly is done away with. Furthermore, the concept of 'weakening of the welfare state' given by Margaret Thatcher advocates doing away with the subsidies and reduce the government expenditure.

However, the above views are not acceptable in the context of Indian constitution because these views attribute a state-centric interpretation to the word 'socialist'. Whereas the constitution views socialism as a value for building a social order based on justice. In that social order socialism is prescribed as value, a social moral.

The concept of socialism is centred on the objective of providing right to access and not state centrism. Therefore, the steps taken by the government in respect of LPG (Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization) have to be viewed from this standpoint. The LPG only enhances the role of the private sector and does not result in complete pulling out the state. The state has:

- Pulled out only from such areas where its presence is not necessary or where the private sector can perform better than the state.
- Pulled out in order to avoid exposing the public money to an unnecessary risk by way of partaking them with the non-strategic sectors.
- Liberalized to provide better qualities of services to the people.
- Liberalized to ensure the 'value for their money'.

By this, the state has permitted the private sector in order to shoulder the responsibilities and the risks so that the welfare objectives are achieved. In any case, the state has not absolved itself of the responsibility to regulate the market. Hence, the meaning of socialism is nowhere compromised.

Furthermore, the concept of democratic socialism provides for a mixed economy which does not exclude the presence of private participants. In the context of liberalization, the scope of mixed economy is widened only with the view to promote the welfare, by way of providing better quality of services, value for money to the people and conserving the state's resources—finance, human and time that could be meaningfully spent on such sectors as social and economic so as to promote the welfare goals. Hence, the term socialist is very much relevant, its meaning remains intact and not required to be defined.

# Secularism

The term secular was not included in the original constitution. But, the spirit of secularism was ever found in the constitution. The Preamble declares that the constitution secures 'to all citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship'. The 42 Amendment Act, 1976 inserted the term 'secular' in the Preamble.

## *Secularism: Western View*

*Important questions from Previous years' on this topics are mentioned below:* How do the Indian debates on secularism differ from the debates in the West? *(IAS Mains 2014: GS Paper I)*  Give your views on the right to freedom of religion as enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Do they make India a secular state? *(IAS GS Polity: Mains 2005)*

The concept of secularism refers to guaranteeing every individual the liberty of managing his religious affairs, embracing a religion and worship. According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, 'secularism means being non-spiritual and having no concern with religious matters. It is used in the sense of being opposed to religion. However, secularism and religion are not hostile to each other but are mutually exclusive. Secularism does not oppose religion or advocate the abandonment of religion. Religion and secularism can perfectly coexist. It refers to being neutral to religious affairs.

## *Secularism in India: A Progressive Concept*

The western view of secularism is not acceptable in the Indian context. The founding fathers of the constitution sought to establish India as a secular state. It is 'the state that is not going to make any discrimination whatsoever on the ground of religion or community against any person professing any particular form of religious faith. This means, in essence that no particular religion in the state will

n n n

receive any state patronage whatsoever. The state is not going to establish, patronize or endow any particular religion to the exclusion of or in preference to others and that no citizen in the state will have any preferential treatment or will be discriminated against simply on the ground that he professed a particular form of religion. In other words, in the affairs of the state the professing of any particular religion will not be taken into consideration at all.'<sup>(5)</sup>

#### Progressive Features of Indian Secularism

- Irreligious state
- Equality and tolerance
- Absolute right to conscience
- Reasonable restrictions
- Right not to pay tax
- Prohibition on discrimination or preferential treatment
- Right to property as fundamental right

The constitution guarantees the following freedoms to all persons in India:

- 1. Freedom of conscience and the right to profess practise and propagate a religion of his faith (Article 25).
- 2. Freedom to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and administer their affairs (Article 26).
- 3. Freedom to own and acquire properties (Article 26).
- 4. The right not pay any tax for the promotion of any particular religion (Article 27).
- 5. Prohibition on imparting religious instructions in the state-run/state-funded educational institutions (Article 28).
- 6. Prohibiting discrimination with regard to places of public importance (Article 15).
- 7. Providing equal opportunity in matters of public employment (Article 16).
- 8. Right of the minorities to conserve their language, script and culture (Article 29).
- 9. Right of the minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice (Article 30).

FIGURE 3.1: Secularism in India

<sup>5</sup> Constituent Assembly Debates Monday, the 6th December 1948

This clearly indicates that secularism in Indian context is based on 'freedom, equality and tolerance'. The constitution does not erect a wall separating state and religion. It requires the state to be non-partisan. The state will not identify itself with any religion. The state is neither theistic nor theocratic nor an atheistic state. The state is envisaged as an 'Irreligious State'. Moreover, the constitution guarantees the right to religion subject to reasonable restrictions so that equality is established. Thus, Indian secularism is a 'progressive' concept.

Every individual is guaranteed with the right to conscience that is, one can embrace any religious faith, or remain agnostic or even atheistic. The state shall keep itself away from 'man–God' relations and shall only regulate the 'man–man' relations. The Supreme Court has held that the right to conscience is an absolute right and must not be subject to regulation. Irrespective of this the state shall treat every individual equally and must not treat any one preferentially or discriminate any of them.

The state must keep equidistance from all religions. In case of any privilege or patronage accorded to any religion shall be available to all religions equally. All religions must be provided with equal opportunity for development. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 16 guarantee equality by prohibiting any discrimination on the ground of religion. Towards promoting equality, Article 44 directs the state to secure a uniform civil code for all citizens.

The religious denominations/groups are guaranteed the freedom to manage their religious affairs and establish institutions for that purpose. They also have the right to acquire and own property as a fundamental right even after the constitution (44 Amendment Act) which repealed the right to property as a fundamental right. On the same lines the educational institutions established by the minorities also enjoy the right to property as fundamental right.

Further, the constitution guarantees the right not to pay tax if the proceeds of such tax are to be used for the promotion of any particular religion. This is a towering feature of Indian secularism. Tax is compulsory exaction of money and the power to impose tax is an important feature of sovereign power.

The state-run or state-funded educational institutions are prohibited from imparting any religious instructions. However, the institutions set-up by the religious groups, imparting religious instructions are permitted but no one should be compelled to receive them. In case of minors, the consent of their parents or guardians is essential for imparting religious instructions. This is fully in conformation with the Preamble and Article 25 (1) which guarantees the right to conscience as an absolute freedom.

Given the complexities of Indian culture, the debate on secularism is different from that in other countries. In India the religion happens to be the basis for the caste and the associated discriminatory practices. Traditionally the social evil practices such as untouchability, gender disparity, etc., were justified on ground of religion. Hence, the restrictions on this right are essential. Further, the state needs to be empowered to regulate the right in order to promote social reforms. It is also essential to regulate the economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice.

#### Components of Secularism

- *Samanata* (equality) is incorporated in Article 14.
- Prohibition against discrimination on the ground of religion, caste, etc., is incorporated in Articles 15 and 16.
- Freedom of speech and expression and all other important freedoms of all the citizens are conferred under Articles 19 and 21.
- Right to practice religion is conferred under Articles 25 to 28.
- Fundamental duty of the state to enact uniform civil laws treating all the citizens as equal, is imposed by Article 44.
- Sentiment of majority of the people towards the cow and against its slaughter was incorporated in Article 48.

Reference: The Constitution of India: P. M. Bakshi (9<sup>th</sup> edition; Page 3)

Similarly, the educational institutions established by the minorities are also subjected to the regulation of the state with respect to the quality of education. The state must prevent any regressive education in the garb of religious freedom.

The constitution guarantees the right to the individuals and conferred power on the state to create conducive conditions for the smooth and harmonious exercise of the same. Thus, the concept of secularism in India is a progressive one.

### **Sovereignty**

Sovereignty refers to the power of any state to manage its affairs on its own and without being controlled or influenced by any external force. Preamble declares the resolve of the people of India to establish India as a sovereign country not subjected to the paramountcy of any power. The state apparatus derives its power from the constitution which in turn derives its power from the people. Thus, sovereignty in India is 'popular sovereignty'. Popular sovereignty is established by conferring voting rights on the people by means of universal adult suffrage (Article 326).

### *Sovereignty and Commonwealth Membership*

After independence, India became the member of Commonwealth of British Nations. The Commonwealth membership indicates that the member countries accept the suzerainty of the British Crown and the people of such countries to be subjects of the Crown. This created a debate that India being a member of Commonwealth was incompatible with the constitutional values. However, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru explained that India's decision to be part of Commonwealth was by itself a sovereign decision. It is the expression of goodwill to maintain amicable and friendly relations with Britain after independence. He also explained that India reserved the right to continue the membership and it is India's sovereign decision to be exercised by India without any external influence in accordance with the circumstances.

### *Sovereign: Is it Defendable in the Present Circumstance?*

It is often debated that the concept of sovereignty has become irrelevant and therefore indefensible in the present globalization era. Globalization has increased the mutual dependency among the nations that no nation can be truly independent. Further the regional blocs like Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), European Union, etc., and the regional arrangements like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) have also been establishing the concept of 'shared sovereignty'. However, the concept of sovereignty is all the more relevant in the present circumstances because every country needs to protect its national interest.

Furthermore, the constitution of India prescribes these as values to be inculcated to each individual. Sovereignty as an individual value refers to the right of an individual to make his choices with respect to his needs and wants. In the era of globalization and marketization, the individual is subject to the 'corporate colonialism and corporate imperialism'. The corporates through their powerful marketing seek to 'engineer' the minds of the individuals and impose decisions on them. The issue of 'paid news' has made the role of media questionable in this regard. The media, instead of keeping the citizen informed and sensitized, so that he is capable of making informed decision, is imposing decisions. This defeats the purpose of the right to freedom of expression that aims to make the citizen self-fulfilled person. Therefore, sovereignty has to be completely defended in the present context.

In this context, the state is expected to drive its policies more towards protecting and actively guaranteeing the fundamental rights. The state also needs to maintain transparency and ensure public accountability of not only the public organizations but also the private. For instance, there was a debate on holding the celebrities, who act as brand ambassadors of certain products, accountable for the products and the information about the products that are displayed in the advertisements. Though it is a debatable issue, presence of such an accountability mechanism could act as a deterrent and could safeguard citizen's right to choose.
