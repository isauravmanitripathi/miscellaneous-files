Also known as the Rio Summit, Rio Conference, Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992.

The issues addressed included:

- Systematic scrutiny of patterns of production particularly the production of toxic components, such as lead in gasoline, or poisonous waste including radioactive chemicals
- Alternative sources of energy to replace the use of fossil fuels which are linked to global climate change
- New reliance on public transportation systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smog
- The growing scarcity of water

### **The Earth Summit resulted in the following documents:**

- Rio Declaration on Environment and Development
- Agenda 21
- Forest Principles

### **Moreover, two important legally binding agreements**

- 1. Convention on Biological Diversity
- 2. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, often shortened to Rio Declaration, was a short document produced at the 1992 United Nations "Conference on Environment and Development" (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit. The Rio Declaration consisted of

27 principles intended to guide future sustainable development around the world.

#### **Agenda 21**

- Agenda 21 is an action plan of the United Nations (UN) related to sustainable development and was an outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992.
- It is a comprehensive blueprint of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the UN, governments, and major groups in every area in which humans directly affect the environment.
- The number 21 refers to an agenda for the 21st century.

#### **Local Agenda 21**

• The implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally, as recommended in Chapter 28 of the document. Such programmes are often known as 'Local Agenda 21' or 'LA21'.

#### **Agenda 21 for culture**

- During the first World Public Meeting on Culture, held in Porto Alegre, Brazil in 2002, it came up with the idea to draw up document guidelines for local cultural policies, a document comparable to what Agenda 21 meant in 1992 for the environment.
- The Agenda 21 for culture is the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development.

#### **Rio+5**

- In 1997, the General Assembly of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of Agenda 21 (Rio +5).
- The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing globalization, widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment.

#### **The Johannesburg Summit**

• The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Earth Summit 2002) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements. **eeups** 

#### **Rio +20**

- "Rio+20" is the short name for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development which took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2012 – twenty years after the landmark 1992 Earth Summit in Rio.
- At the Rio+20 Conference, world leaders, along with thousands of participants from the private sector, NGOs and other groups, came together to shape how we can reduce poverty, advance social equity and ensure environmental protection on an ever more crowded planet.
- The official discussions focussed on two main themes:
- 1. how to build a green economy to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty; and
- 2. how to improve international coordination for sustainable development.
- AT Rio+20, more than \$513 billion was pledged to build a sustainable future. It signaled a major step forward in achieving the future we want.

#### **2. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**

• CBD is a Legally binding Convention recognized for the first time, that the conservation of biological diversity is "a common concern of humankind" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources.

#### **Objectives**

• The conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate funding.

#### **Three main goals:**

- The conservation of biodiversity
- Sustainable use of the components of biodiversity
- Sharing the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources in a fair and equitable way

The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

#### Do you know?

The current population of the Greater adjutant stork is only 1,200, of which, 80 percent are found in Assam. The bird's habitat has been greatly impacted by human development.

#### **Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity**

Biosafety refers to the need to protect human health and the environment from the possible adverse effects of the products of modern biotechnology.

The Convention clearly recognizes these twin aspects of modern biotechnology.

- 1. Access to and transfer of technologies
- 2. Appropriate procedures to enhance the safety of biotechnology technologies.

#### **Objective**

Is to contribute to ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, taking also into account risks to human health, and specifically focusing on transboundary movements.

- The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is an additional agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
- The Protocol establishes procedures for regulating the import and export of LMOs from one country to another.
- The Protocol also requires Parties to ensure that LMOs being shipped from one country to another are handled, packaged and transported in a safe manner.
- The shipments must be accompanied by documentation that clearly identifies the LMOs, specifies any requirements for the safe handling, storage, transport and use and provides contact details for further information.

There are two main sets of procedures, one for LMOs intended for direct introduction into the environment, known as the advance informed agreement (AIA) procedure, and another for LMOs intended for direct use as food or feed, or for processing (LMOs-FFP).

#### **Advance Informed Agreement**

• Under the AIA procedure, a country intending to export an LMO for intentional release into the environment must notify in writing the Party of import before the first proposed export takes place.

- The Party of import must acknowledge receipt of the notification within 90 days and must communicate its decision on whether or not to import the LMO within 270 days.
- Parties are required to ensure that their decisions are based on a risk assessment of the LMO, which must be carried out in a scientifically sound and transparent manner.
- Once a Party takes a decision on the LMO, it is required to communicate the decision as well as a summary of the risk assessment to a central information system, the Biosafety Clearing-House (BCH).

#### **LMOs- food or feed, or for processing**

• Under the procedure for LMOs-FFP, Parties that decide to approve and place such LMOs on the market are required to make their decision and relevant information, including the risk assessment reports, publicly available through the BCH.

#### **Nagoya—Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol**

- The Cartagena Protocol is reinforced by the Nagoya— Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress.
- The Supplementary Protocol specifies response measures to be taken in the event of damage to biodiversity resulting from LMOs.
- The competent authority in a Party to the Supplementary Protocol must require the person in control of the LMO (operator) to take the response measures or it may implement such measures itself and recover any costs incurred from the operator.

#### **Nagoya Protocol**

The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity.

It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD.

#### **Objective**

materials.org

Is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

#### **Obligations**

The Nagoya Protocol sets out core obligations for its contracting Parties to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing and compliance.

#### **Access obligations**

- Domestic-level access measures are to:
- Create legal certainty, clarity and transparency
- Provide fair and non-arbitrary rules and procedures
- Establish clear rules and procedures for prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms
- Provide for issuance of a permit or equivalent when access is granted
- Create conditions to promote and encourage research contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use
- Pay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten human, animal or plant health
- Consider the importance of genetic resources for food and agriculture for food security

#### **Benefit-sharing obligations**

- Domestic-level benefit-sharing measures are to provide for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources with the contracting party providing genetic resources.
- Utilization includes research and development on the genetic or biochemical composition of genetic resources, as well as subsequent applications and commercialization.
- Sharing is subject to mutually agreed terms.
- Benefits may be monetary or non-monetary such as royalties and the sharing of research results.

#### **Compliance obligations**

Specific obligations to support compliance with the domestic legislation or regulatory requirements of the contracting party providing genetic resources, and contractual obligations reflected in mutually agreed terms, are a significant innovation of the Nagoya Protocol. Contracting Parties are to:

- Take measures providing that genetic resources utilized within their jurisdiction have been accessed in accordance with prior informed consent, and that mutually agreed terms have been established, as required by another contracting party
- Cooperate in cases of alleged violation of another contracting party's requirements WWITCCUDSCI

- Encourage contractual provisions on dispute resolution in mutually agreed terms
- Ensure an opportunity is available to seek recourse under their legal systems when disputes arise from mutually agreed terms
- Take measures regarding access to justice
- Take measures to monitor the utilization of genetic resources after they leave a country including by designating effective checkpoints at any stage of the value-chain: research, development, innovation, pre-commercialization or commercialization

#### **Traditional knowledge**

- The Nagoya Protocol addresses traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources with provisions on access, benefit-sharing and compliance.
- It also addresses genetic resources where indigenous and local communities have the established right to grant access to them.
- Contracting Parties are to take measures to ensure these communities' prior informed consent, and fair and equitable benefit-sharing, keeping in mind community laws and procedures as well as customary use and exchange.

#### **Importance**

The Nagoya Protocol will create greater legal certainty and transparency for both providers and users of genetic resources by:

- Establishing more predictable conditions for access to genetic resources.
- Helping to ensure benefit-sharing when genetic resources leave the contracting party providing the genetic resources

By helping to ensure benefit-sharing, the Nagoya Protocol creates incentives to conserve and sustainably use genetic resources, and therefore enhances the contribution of biodiversity to development and human well-being.

#### **The Biodiversity Target**

- It was adopted in May 2002 during the sixth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
- The Target aimed to achieve, by 2010 'a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on earth'.

• Unfortunately, we were unable to meet the target. As we are facing an ever-increasing biodiversity crisis, we need a new, clear and realistic target to respond to it.

#### **Strategic Plan For Biodiversity 2011-2020**

- In the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held in 2010, in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, adopted a revised and updated Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, for the 2011- 2020 period.
- The tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties agreed to translate this overarching international framework into national biodiversity strategies and action plans within two years.
- Additionally, the meeting decided that the fifth national reports, due by 31 March 2014, should focus on the implementation of the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan and progress achieved towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

This target will

be subject to changes contingent to resource needs assessments to be developed and reported by Parties.

#### **CoP 11 hyderabad**

- One of the most important outcomes of the CoP is the commitment of the Parties to double the international financial flows for Bio Diversity by 2015. This will translate into additional financial flows to the developing countries to the tune of about US \$ 30 billion equivalent to about Rs. 1,50,000 crore over the next 8 years.
- India has committed US \$50 million towards strengthening the institutional mechanism for biodiversity conservation in the country during its presidency of the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) called the Hyderabad Pledge
- The funds will be used to enhance technical and human capabilities at the national and state-level mechanisms to attain the CBD objectives.
- The country has also earmarked funds to promote similar capacity building in developing countries. India formally took charge of the presidency of CBD from Japan for the next two years on October 8 at the inaugural of the eleventh meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP 11) to CBD.
- India has instituted together with UNDP Biodiversity Governance Awards. The first such awards were given during the CoP 11. It is now proposed to institute Rajiv Gandhi International Award for Harnessing Biodiversity for Livelihood.

#### **28.3 RAMSAR CONVENTION ON WETLANDS**

- The Convention on Wetlands [waterfowl convention] is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources.
- It was adopted in the Iranian city of Ramsar in 1971 and came into force in 1975, and it is the only global environmental treaty that deals with a particular ecosystem.
- Ramsar is not affiliated with the United Nations system of Multilateral Environmental Agreements, but it works very closely with the other MEAs and is a full partner among the "biodiversity-related cluster" of treaties and agreements.
- World Wetlands Day, 2 February every year. Number of Contracting Parties: 163

#### **Mission**

"The conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local, regional and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world".

"Three pillars" of the Convention

#### **The Parties have committed themselves to:**

- Work towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education;
- Designate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance ("Ramsar List") and ensure their effective management; and
- Cooperate internationally concerning transboundary wetlands, shared wetland systems, shared species, and development projects that may affect wetlands.

#### **The "Ramsar List"**

- At the time of joining the Convention, each Contracting Party designates at least one site for inclusion in the List of Wetlands of International Importance (the "Ramsar List").
- The addition of a site to the Ramsar List confers upon it the prestige of international recognition and expresses the government's commitment to take all steps necessary to ensure the maintenance of the ecological character of the site.

#### **Transboundary Ramsar Sites**

- An ecologically coherent wetland extends across national borders and the Ramsar site authorities on both or all sides of the border have formally agreed to collaborate in its management, and have notified the Secretariat of this intent.
- This is a cooperative management arrangement and not a distinct legal status for the Ramsar sites involved.

#### **The Montreux Record**

- Adopted by the Conference of the Contracting Parties in Brisbane, 1996, accompanying the Guidelines for Operation of the Montreux Record
- The Montreux Record is a register of wetland sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance where changes in ecological character have occurred, are occurring, or are likely to occur as a result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference.
- It is the the principal tool of the Convention and is maintained as part of the Ramsar List.

#### **Indian wetland and the Montreux Record**

- Keoladeo National Park, Rajasthan and Loktak Lake, Manipur have been included in Montreux Record in 1990 and in 1993 respectively
- Chilika Lake, Orissa included in Montreux Record in 1993 have been removed in November 2002. It is placed on the Montreux Record due to problems caused by siltation and sedimentation which was choking the mouth of the lake; removed from the Record in 2002 following rehabilitation efforts for which the Chilika Development Authority received the Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award for 2002.

#### **"IOPs"**

Five global non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been associated with the treaty since its beginnings and were confirmed in the formal status of International Organization Partners (IOPs) of the Convention.

- 1. BirdLife International (formerly ICBP)
- 2. IUCN The International Union for the Conservation of Nature
- 3. IWMI The International Water Management Institute
- 4. Wetlands International (formerly IWRB, the Asian Wetlands Bureau, and Wetlands for the Americas)

- CITES is administered through the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). A Secretariat, located in Geneva, Switzerland, oversees the implementation of the treaty and assists with communications between countries.

#### **Protecting Species from Unsustainable Trade**

• Species for which trade is controlled are listed in one of three Appendices to CITES, each conferring a different level of regulation and requiring CITES permits or certificates.

#### **Appendix I:**

• Includes species threatened with extinction and provides the greatest level of protection, including restrictions on commercial trade. Examples include gorillas, sea turtles, most lady slipper orchids, and giant pandas.

#### **Appendix II:**

• Includes species that although currently not threatened with extinction, may become so without trade controls. It also includes species that resemble other listed species and need to be regulated in order to effectively control the trade in those other listed species.

#### **Appendix III:**

- Includes species for which a range country has asked other Parties to help in controlling international trade. Examples include map turtles, walruses and Cape stag beetles.
- Until CoP13, these meeting were held every two years; since then, CoPs are held every three years.
- CoP16 is scheduled to occur from March 3-14, 2013 in Bangkok, Thailand.

#### **CITES Role in Conservation**

## 28.12. THE GLOBAL TIGER FORUM (GTF)

The Global Tiger Forum (GTF) is an intergovernmental and international body established with members from willing countries to embark on a worldwide campaign, common approach, promotion of appropriate programmes and controls to save the remaining five sub-species of tigers in the wild distributed over 14 tiger range countries of the world.

Formed in 1994 with its secretariat at New Delhi, GTF is the only inter-governmental & international body campaigning to save the TIGER worldwide.

The General Assembly of GTF shall meet once in three years.

### Goal:

To highlight the rationale for tiger preservation and provide leadership and common approach throughout the world in order to safeguard the survival of the tiger, its prey and its habitat.

### Objectives:

- To promote a worldwide campaign to save the tiger, its prey and its habitat;
- To promote a legal framework in the countries involved for bio-diversity conservation;
- To increase the protected area network of habitats of the tiger and facilitate their inter passages in the range countries;
- To promote eco-development programmes with the participation of the communities living in and around protected areas;
- . To urge countries to enter into relevant conventions for conservation of tiger and elimination of illegal trade;
- To promote and carry out scientific research to generate information useful for tiger, it's prey and its habitat to disseminate such information in an easily accessible manner;
- To promote the development and exchange among themselves, of appropriate technologies and training programmes for scientific wildlife www.freeupscreepierials.org management;

To encourage range countries to prepare and implement their individual action plans for protection and growth of the tiger population and its prey base. Improvement of the habitat and common preservation programme can be taken up bilaterally by the range countries having adjoining habitats, but their implementation should be carried out separately by the respective range countries.

**ENVIRONMENT** 

- To involve inter-governmental organisations in the protection of the tiger;
- To set up a participative fund of an appropriate size to engender awareness in all places where people consume tiger derivatives for eliminating such consumption of tiger products, and identifying substitutes, in the interests of conservation.

### **Global Tiger Initiative**

An alliance of governments, international agencies, civil society, and the private sector united to save wild tigers from extinction

### **Goals of GTI**

- To support capacity-building in governments for responding effectively to the transnational challenge of illegal trade in wildlife and for scientifically managing tiger landscapes in the face of mounting and varied threats;
- To curtail international demand for tiger parts and other wildlife that has been responsible for drastic declines in tiger populations;
- To develop mechanisms for safeguarding habitats from development through planning 'smart, green' infrastructure and sensitive industrial development;
- To create innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms for tiger landscapes including protected areas;
- · To build strong local constituencies for tiger conservation through development of economic incentives and alternative livelihoods for local

• To spread the recognition among governments, international aid agencies and the public that tiger habitats are high-value diverse ecosystems with the potential to provide immense benefits-both tangible and intangible

# 28.13 THE STOCKHOLM CONVENTION **ON POP**

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted at a Conference of Plenipotentiaries on 22 May 2001 in Stockholm. Sweden and entered into force on 17 May 2004,

#### **POPs**

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are organic chemical substances, that is, they are carbon-based. They possess a particular combination of physical and chemical properties such that, once released into the environment, they:

- remain intact for exceptionally long periods of time (many years);
- become widely distributed throughout the environment as a result of natural processes involving soil, water and, most notably, air, long range environment transport (LRET).
- accumulate in the fatty tissue of living organisms including humans, and are found at higher concentrations at higher levels in the food chain; and
- are toxic to both humans and wildlife.
- Exposure to POPs can lead to cancer, damage to central & peripheral nervous systems, diseases of immune system, reproductive disorders and interference with normal infant and child development.

In addition, POPs concentrate in living organisms through another process called bioaccumulation. Though not soluble in water, POPs are readily absorbed in fatty tissue, where concentrations can become magnified by up to 70,000 times the background levels.

#### The 12 initial POPs

Initially, twelve POPs have been recognized as causing adverse effects on humans and the ecosystem and these can be placed in 3 categories:

- 1. Pesticides: aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene;
- 2. Industrial chemicals: hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs); and
- 3. By-products: hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF), and PCBs.

# The new POPs under the Stockholm Convention

#### **Nine new POPs**

At its fourth meeting held in 2009, the CoP adopted amendments to Annexes A, B and C to the Stockholm Convention to list nine new persistent organic pollutants.

- 1. Pesticides: chlordecone, alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane, lindane, pentachloro benzene;
- 2. Industrial chemicals: hexabromobi phenyl, hexabromodi phenyl ether and heptabromodiphenyl ether, pentachloro benzene, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluoro octane sulfonyl fluoride, tetrabromo di phenyl ether and pentabromo di phenyl ether; and
- 3. By-products: alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachloro benzene.

# Endosulfan

At its fifth meeting held in 2011, the CoP adopted an amendment to Annex A to the Stockholm Convention to list technical endosulfan and its related isomers with a specific exemption.

# **India and POPs**

· India had ratified the Stockholm Convention on 2006 as per Article 25(4), which enabled it to keep itself in a default "opt-out" position such that amendments in various Annexes of the convention

**ENVIRONMENT** 

cannot be enforced on it unless an instrument of ratification/ acceptance/ approval or accession is explicitly deposited with UN depositary.

**IAS ACADEMY** 

- . MoEFCC had notified the 'Regulation of Persistent Organic Pollutants Rules, on March 2018 under the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
- . The regulation inter alia prohibited the manufacture, trade, use, import and export seven chemicals namely (i) Chlordecone, (ii) Hexabromobiphenyl, (iii) Hexabromodiphenyl ether and Heptabromodiphenylether (Commercial octa-BDE), (iv) Tetrabromodiphenyl ether and Pentabromodiphenyl ether (Commercial penta- $(v)$ Pentachlorobenzene, BDE),  $(vi)$ Hexabromocyclododecane, and  $(vii)$ Hexachlorobutadiene, which were already listed as POPs under Stockholm Convention.
- It also indicates the resolve of the Government to take action on POPs by implementing control measures, develop and implement action plans for unintentionally produced chemicals, develop inventories of the chemicals' stockpiles and review as well as update its National Implementation Plan (NIP).
- The ratification process would enable India to  $\bullet$ access Global Environment Facility (GEF) financial resources in updating the NIP.
- The Cabinet further delegated its powers to ratify chemicals under the Stockholm Convention to Union Ministers of External Affairs (MEA) and (MEFCC) in respect of POPs already regulated under the domestic regulations thereby streamlining the procedure.

# 28.14 BASEL CONVENTION

The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad.

### **Objective**

0000000

To protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as "hazardous wastes" based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as "other wastes" household waste and incinerator ash.

#### **Principal aims:**

- The reduction of hazardous waste generation and the promotion of environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal;
- the restriction of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; and
- a regulatory system applying to cases where transboundary movements are permissible.

#### **Waste under the Basel Convention**

Wastes are substances or objects which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law.

#### Annex

Annex I of the Convention, as further clarified in Annexes VIII and IX, lists those wastes that are classified as hazardous and subject to the control procedures under the Convention.

Annex II of the Convention identifies those wastes that require special consideration (known as "other wastes", and which primarily refer to household wastes).

# 28.15 ROTTERDAM CONVENTION

**GHANKAR** 

**IAS ACADEMY** 

- It was adopted in 1998 by a Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and entered into force on 24 February 2004.
- The Convention creates legally binding obligations for the implementation of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. It built on the voluntary PIC procedure, initiated by UNEP and FAO in 1989 and ceased on 24 February 2006.
- The Convention covers pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by Parties and which have been notified by Parties for inclusion in the PIC procedure.

### Objectives:

- to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm:
- to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties.

### **Annex III Chemicals**

- The chemicals listed in Annex III include pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by two or more Parties and which the Conference of the Parties has decided to subject to the PIC procedure.
- There are a total of 43 chemicals listed in Annex III, 32 are pesticides (including 4 severely hazardous pesticide formulations) and 11 industrial chemicals. WWW.ITEEUDSO

One notification from each of two specified regions triggers consideration of addition of a chemical to Annex III of the Convention. Severely hazardous pesticide formulations that present a risk under conditions of use in developing countries or countries with economies in transition may also be proposed for inclusion in Annex III.

# 28.16. UNCCD

000000

- · Established in 1994, UNCCD is the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management.
- The UNCCD is particularly committed to a bottom-up approach, encouraging the participation of local people in combating desertification and land degradation.
- . The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) is one of the Rio Conventions that focuses on desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD).
- 'Desertification' as defined in the UNCCD refers to land degradation in the drylands (arid, semi arid and dry sub humid regions) resulting from various factors and does not connote spread or expansion of deserts.
- UNCCD with 194 Parties is a unique instrument that recognises land degradation as an important factor affecting some of the most vulnerable people and ecosystems in the world.
- The convention aims at adaption and can, on implementation, significantly contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as sustainable development and poverty reduction by means of arresting and reversing land degradation.
- The convention promotes sustainable land management (SLM) as solution to global challenges. Land degradation is long-term loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused by disturbances from which the land cannot recover unaided. While Sustainable Land Management is focused on changes in land cover/land use in

order to maintain and enhance ecosystems functions and services.

# **INCCD COP 14**

SHANKAR **IAS ACADEMY** 

- . The 14thConference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) convened in New Delhi, India, September 2019.
- The adopted decisions included guidance on how to implement four thematic policy frameworks approved at the last COP, addressing drought, gender, sand and dust storms, as well as desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) as a driver for migration.
- The COP also agreed to include land tenure as a new thematic area under the Convention.Other initiatives launched at COP 14 included: a road map for scaling up the Africa-led Great Green Wall Initiative to restore 100 million hectares of land and create 10 million green jobs by 2030; the new UNCCD interactive Drought Toolbox that serves to strengthen countries' preparedness and resilience; and an international coalition on sand and dust storms aimed at mitigating their transboundary impacts on human health, the environment and key economic sectors.
- India announced its commitment to enhance implementation of the UNCCD through, among other actions: establishing a center of excellence to promote South-South exchange; raising its 2030 land restoration target from 21 million hectares to 26 million hectares; and taking into consideration land-based solutions for climate action and biodiversity conservation and the mutually supportive implementation of the three Rio conventions.

# 28.17. INTERNATIONAL WHALING **COMMISSION**

The International Whaling Commission is the ٠ global intergovernmental body charged with the conservation of whales and the management of whaling with headquarters in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

• It was set up under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was signed in Washington DC on 2nd December 1946

**ENVIRONMENT** 

#### Preamble

 $0^{\circ}$  800

To provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry.

- Main duty
- To keep under review and revise as necessary the measures laid down in the Schedule to the Convention which govern the conduct of whaling throughout the world.
- These measures, among other things, provide for the complete protection of certain species; designate specified areas as whale sanctuaries; set limits on the numbers and size of whales which may be taken; prescribe open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; and prohibit the capture of suckling calves and female whales accompanied by calves.
- The compilation of catch reports and other statistical and biological records is also required.
- In 1986 the Commission introduced zero catch  $\bullet$ limits for commercial whaling. This provision is still in place today, although the Commission continues to set catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling.
- As well as keeping whale catch limits under review, the Commission works to promote the recovery of depleted whale populations by addressing a range of specific issues. These include ship strikes, entanglement events, environmental concerns and establishing protocols for whale watching.

### **28.18. VIENNA CONVENTION**

- Vienna convention adopted in the year 1985 and entered into force in 1988.

![](1__page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer are dedicated to the protection of the earth's ozone laver. With 197 parties, they are the most widely ratified treaties in United Nations history.

### **Montreal Protocol**

- The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the earth's fragile ozone Layer.
- The treaty was opened for signature on September 16, 1987, and entered into force on January 1, 1989, followed by a first meeting in Helsinki, May 1989. Since then, it has undergone seven revisions, in 1990 (London), 1991 (Nairobi), 1992 (Copenhagen), 1993 (Bangkok), 1995 (Vienna), 1997 (Montreal), and 1999 (Beijing).

#### India and Protection of Ozone Layer

- India became a Party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of Ozone Layer on 19 June 1991 and the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer on 17 September 1992.
- Consequently, it ratified the Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments in 2003.
- · India produces CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, Halon-1211, HCFC-22, Halon-1301, Carbontetrachloride (CTC), methyl chloroform and methyl bromide. These ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are used in refrigeration and air conditioning, fire fighting, electronics, foams, aerosol fumigation applications.
- A detailed India Country Programme for phase out of ODS was prepared in 1993 to ensure the phase out of ODS according to the national industrial development strategy, without undue burden to the consumers and the industry and for accessing the Protocol's Financial Mechanism in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the Montreal Protocol.

- The Ministry of Environment and Forests established an Ozone Cell and a steering committee on the Montreal Protocol to facilitate implementation of the India Country Programme for phasing out ODS (ozone depleting substances) production by 2010.
- In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, the Indian government has granted full exemption from payment of Customs and Central Excise Duties on import of goods designed exclusively for non-ODS technology.
- India has also been facilitating implementation of the Montreal Protocol in South and South East Asia and the Pacific regions.

# 28.19 KIGALI AGREEMENT

 $C$ 

- Twenty-Eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer held in Kigali, Rwanda amended the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase out Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were discontinued under the Montreal Protocol when scientists realised they were destroying the ozone layer.
- HFCs were introduced in the 1990s as an alternative to replace chemicals that had been found to erode the ozone layer, but turned out to be catastrophic for global warming.
- HFCs though they are greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - are not dealt with under the Paris Agreement but under the Montreal Protocol.
- The elimination of HFCs could reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees by 2100, according to a 2015 study by the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development.
- However, swapping HFCs for alternatives such as ammonia, water or gases called hydrofluoroolefins could prove costly for developing countries with high summer temperatures, such as India.

# **ENVIRONMEN**

• The Kigali Agreement for HFCs reduction will be binding on countries from 2019.

SHANKAR<br>IAS ACADEMY

- · Under legally binding Kigali Amendment, 197 countries have agreed to a timeline to reduce the use of HFCs by roughly 85% of their baselines by 2045.
- Group 1 Developed countries must reduce their use of HFCs by 10 percent by 2019 from 2011-2013 levels, and then by 85 percent by 2036.
- A second group of developing countries, including China and African nations, are committed to launching the transition in 2024.
- A reduction of 10 percent compared with 2020-2022 levels should be achieved by 2029, to be extended to 80 percent by 2045.
- ٠ A third group of developing countries, which include India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Arab Gulf states, must begin the process in 2028 and reduce emissions by 10 percent by 2032 from 2024-2026 levels, and then by 85 percent by 2047.

#### 28.19.1. India phase out hcfc 141 b

- India has successfully achieved the complete phase out of Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141 b
- HCFC-141b is a chemical used mainly as a blowing agent in the production of rigid polyurethane (PU) foams and one of the most potent ozone depleting chemical after Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
- Nearly, 50 % of the consumption of ozone depleting chemicals in the country was attributable to HCFC-141 b in the foam sector.
- The polyurethane foam sector has links with important economic sectors related to buildings, cold storages and cold chain infrastructure, automobiles, commercial refrigeration, domestic appliances such as refrigerators, water geysers, thermo ware, office and domestic furniture applications, specific high value niche applications etc.
- HCFC-141b is not produced in the country and all the domestic requirements are met through

imports. MoEFCC prohibited import license for HCFC-141b under Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2019 issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

- Simultaneously, the use of HCFC-141 b by foam manufacturing industry has also been closed under the Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Amendment Rules, 2014.
- The Ministry adopted a structured approach to engage with foam manufacturing enterprises for providing technical and financial assistance in order to transition to non-ODS and low GWP technologies under HCFC Phase out Management Plan (HPMP).
- The phase out of HCFC-141b from the country has twin environmental benefits viz. (i) assisting the healing of the stratospheric ozone layer, and (ii) towards the climate change mitigation due to transitioning of foam manufacturing enterprises at this scale under HPMP to low global warming potential alternative technologies.

In the Koraput system, women have played a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. The Kuttanad system was developed by farmers over 150 years ago to ensure their food security by learning to cultivate rice and other crops below sea level. The Kuttanad System is now attracting worldwide attention since one of the effects of global warming is sea level rise. It has therefore been an act of vision on the part of Kerala government to have decided to set up an International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming in Kuttanad.

# 28.21. MINAMATA CONVENTION

The Minamata Convention on Mercury is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds. It was adopted in 2013 in Kumamoto, Japan. It also controls the transboundary movement of mercury. It does not include natural emissions of mercury.

Mercury is considered to be one of the most toxic metals known. Once released into the environment, mercury bio-accumulates and bio-magnifies up in the food chain, and easily enters the human body and impacts the nervous system.

### The Minamata Convention requires that party nations:

- Reduce and where feasible eliminate the use and release of mercury from artisanal and small-scale gold mining.
- Control mercury air emissions from coal-fired power plants, coal-fired industrial boilers, certain

non-ferrous metals production operations, waste incineration, and cement production.

- Phase-out or take measures to reduce mercury use in certain products such as batteries, switches, lights, cosmetics, pesticides and measuring devices, and create initiatives to reduce the use of mercury in dental amalgam.
- . Phase out or reduce the use of mercury in manufacturing processes such as chlor-alkali production, vinyl chloride monomer production, and acetaldehyde production.
- In addition, the Convention addresses the supply and trade of mercury; safer storage and disposal, and strategies to address contaminated sites.
- The Convention includes provisions for technical  $\bullet$ assistance, information exchange, public awareness, and research and monitoring. It also requires Parties to report on measures taken to implement certain provisions. The Convention will be periodically evaluated to assess its effectiveness in meeting its objective of protecting human health and the environment from mercury pollution.

The Minamata Convention entered into force on August 2017. The first CoP to the Minamata Convention on Mercury (COP1) took place in September 2017 at the International Conference Centre in Geneva. The COP 2 will take place in November 2018 in Geneva, Switzerland

The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal for ratification of Minamata Convention on Mercury along with flexibility for continued use of mercurybased products and processes involving mercury compound up to 2025 and depositing the instrument of ratification enabling India to become a Party of the Convention.
