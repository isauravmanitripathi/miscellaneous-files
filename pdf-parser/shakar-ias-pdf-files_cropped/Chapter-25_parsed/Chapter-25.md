# ACTS AND POLCIES

## **25.1. WILD LIFE PROTECTION ACT 1972**

- India is the first country in the world to have made provisions for the protection and conservation of environment in its constitution. On 5th June 1972, environment was first discussed as an item of international agenda in the U.N. Conference of Human Environment in Stockholm and thereafter 5th June is celebrated all over the world as World Environment Day.
- Soon after the Stockholm Conference our country took substantive legislative steps for environmental protection. The Wildlife (Protection) Act was passed in 1972, followed by the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and subsequently the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

### **25.1.1. Constitutional Provisions**

- The provisions for environmental protection in the constitution were made within four years of Stockholm Conference, in 1976, though the 42nd amendment as follows:
- Article-48-A of the constitution provides:
- "The state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard forest and wildlife of the country."
- Article 51-A (g) Provides:
- It shall be duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife an to have compassion for living creatures."
- Thus our constitution includes environmental protection and conservation as one of our fundamental duties. Some of the important Acts passed by the Government of India are discussed here.

## **25.1.2. The Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972**

- The passing of the Wildlife Act of 1972 constitutes an important landmark in the history of wildlife legislation in the country.
- This is because of the fact that the "Forest" including "Wildlife" was then a State subject falling in Entry 20 List II of Seventh Schedule, Parliament had no power to make law on the same except as provided in Articles 249,250 and 252 of the constitution.
- Having regard to the importance of the matter, the Act has been adopted by all the States except that of Jammu and Kashmir which has a similar law enacted for the purpose of wildlife protection. The operation of the Act is mandatory in the Union Territories too.
- The Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 provides the basic framework to ensure the protection and management of wildlife. The Act was amended subsequently in 1982, 1986, 1991 and 1993 to accommodate provision for its effective implementation.

### **The rationale for passing Act as stated in its Statement of Objects and Reasons are as follows:**

- The rapid decline of India's wild animals and birds, one of the richest and most varied wildlife resources of the country has been a cause of grave concern.
- Areas which were once teeming with wildlife have become devoid of it and even in sanctuaries and National Parks the protection afforded to wildlife needs to be improved.
- The Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act, 1935 has become completely outdated.
- This existing laws not only have become outdated but also provide punishments, which are not commensurate with the offence and financial benefits that occur from poaching and trade in wildlife produce. Further,

such laws mainly relate to control of hunting and do not emphasize the other factors which are also the prime reasons for the decline of India's wildlife namely taxidermy and trade in wildlife and products there from.

#### **25.1.3. Salient features of the Act:**

- The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 is a product of process which started long ago in 1887 for the protection of a few wild birds and after addition of wild animals in 1912 and specified plants in 1919 it covered almost all the wildlife resources which need protection and management.
- 1. The rating of the Schedules I to V is in accordance with the risk of survival of the wildlife (fauna) enlisted in them. Animals included Schedule are provided for total protection from hunting and the trade and commerce related to such animals are strictly regulated. The schedule VI has been added to include the specified plant species to be protected by the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 1991.
- 2. An expert committee, constituted by the Indian Board of Wildlife considers amendments to the Act, as and when necessary.
- 3. With the amendment of the Act in 1991, powers of the State Governments have been withdrawn almost totally. Now the State Governments are not empowered to declare any wild animal a vermin. Further by addition of provision, immunization of livestock within a radius of 5 km from a National Park or sanctuary has been made compulsory.

#### Do you know?

Management Effective Evaluation (MEE), MEE conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority and the Wildlife Institute of India is the assessment of how well protected areas are being managed and their effectiveness in conserving target flora and fauna, the reserves were put into four categories — 'very good', 'good', 'fair' and 'poor'.

## **25.2. ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) ACT, 1986**

• As compared to all other previous laws on environment protection, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a more effective and bold measure to fight the problem of pollution. **www.freeupso** 

- The genesis of the Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, thus, is in Article 48A (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Article 51A (g) (Fundamental Duties) of the Indian Constitution.
- The Act empowers the Central Government to take all appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution and to establish effective machinery for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and protecting controlling and abating environmental pollution.
- The Central Government or any other person duly authorised is empowered to collect the samples of air, water, soil or other substances as evidence of the offences under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
- The Act prescribes a special procedure for handling hazardous substances and the concerned person has to handle the hazardous substances according to the procedure of the Act.
- The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 has relaxed the rule of "Locus Standi" and because of such relaxation even a common citizen can approach the Court provided he has given a notice of sixty days of the alleged offence and his intention to make a complaint to the Central Government or any other competent authority.
- This Act also empowers and authorises the Central Government to issue directions for the operation or process, prohibition, closure, or regulation of any industry. The Central Government is also authorised to stop, regulate the supply of electricity or water or any other service directly without obtaining the order of the Court in this regard.
- The Act consists of and deals with more stringent penal provisions. The minimum penalty for contravention or violation of any provision of the law is an imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years or fine up to one lakh rupees, or both. The Act also provides for the further penalty if the failure or contravention continues after the date of conviction. It is Rs. 5000/- per day. If the failure of contravention continues beyond the period of one year, then the offender is punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years.
- The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 grants immunity to the officers of the Government for any act done under the provisions of this Act or under the powers vested in them or functions assigned to them under this Act.
- The Act debars the Civil Courts from having any jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of

an action, direction, order issued by Central Government or other statutory authority under this Act.

• Under the Act, there will be supremacy of provision. In other words, the provisions of this Act and the rules or orders made under this Act shall have effect and supremacy over anything inconsistent contained in any enactment other than this Act

## **25.3. NATIONAL FOREST POLICY 1988**

• The principal aim of National Forest Policy, 1988 is to ensure environmental stability and maintenance of ecological balance including atmospheric equilibrium which are vital for sustenance of all life forms, human, animal and plant.

#### **25.3.1. Objectives**

The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has recommended notification of the areas 'above' wildlife sanctuaries as a 'silent zone' by keeping the noise level of helicopters within the limit of 50 db. This is the recommendation in WII's interim report with regard to height and noise level for flights over the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWLS).

## **25.5. THE SCHEDULED TRIBES AND OTHER TRADITIONAL FOREST DWELLERS (RECOGNITION OF FOREST RIGHTS) ACT, 2006**

• Forest Rights Act, 2006 provides for the restitution of deprived forest rights across India, including both individual rights to cultivated land in forestland and community rights over common property resources.

### The Act is significant as it provides scope and historic opportunity of integrating conservation and livelihood rights of the people.

The Union Finance Ministry has also slashed the Centre's share of non-recurring expenditure from 100% to 60%, for Project Tiger, leaving the remaining amount for the respective states to manage. However, in the case of special status states, which includes the three Himalayan states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu-Kashmir and Uttarakhand and the Northeastern states, the ratio is 90:10.

#### **25.5.1. FRA is a potential tool**

The National Tiger conservation Authority (NTCA) has recommended Nandhaur Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) to be the third tiger reserve in the Uttarakhand after Rajaji and Corbett. The sanctuary is situated between the Gola and Sarda rivers. It is part of the Terai Arc landscape and the shivalik Elephant Reserve.

## **25.6 GREEN HIGHWAYS (PLANTATION, TRANSPLANTATION, BEAUTIFICATION & MAINTENANCE) POLICY - 2015**

• India has a total 46.99 lakh kms of road length and out of which over 96214 kms are National Highways, accounting 2% of total road length. The Highways carry

about 40% of the traffic load. The Ministry has decided to develop all of existing National Highways and 40,000 kms of additional roads in the next few years as Green Highways.

- The vision is to develop eco-friendly National Highways with participation of the community, farmers, NGOs, private sector, institutions, government agencies and the Forest Department.
- The objective is to reduce the impacts of air pollution and dust as trees and shrubs along the Highways act as natural sink for air pollutants and arrest soil erosion at the embankment slopes. Plants along highway median strips and along the edges reduce the glare of oncoming vehicles which sometimes become cause of accidents. The community involvement in tree plantation directly benefits local people by generating employment. The Panchayats, NGOs and other Self Help Groups (SHGs) will be involved in the process of planting and maintenance. The plant species selected will be region specific depending on local conditions such as rainfall, climate type of soil.
- 1% of the total project cost of all highways projects will be kept aside for the highway plantation and its maintenance, about Rs. 1000 crore per year will be available for plantation purpose. This policy will generate employment opportunities for about five lakh people from rural areas.
- In the new policy, the provisions about the responsibilities attached have also been clearly defined. Now it will be the responsibility of the planting agency to ensure that the condition of the site is good enough for the successful establishment of grasses.
- The monitoring of the plantation status has been included as an integral part of the policy, strong monitoring mechanism in place by using ISRO's Bhuvan and GAGAN satellite systems.
- For Highway projects to be environmentally sustainable, it is necessary that the natural resources lost in the process of Highway construction are restored in one way or the other. This requires that ecological needs are taken into consideration from the stage of project planning and designing to its execution. The Highways developed as green corridors not only sustain biodiversity and regenerate natural habitat but also benefit all stakeholders, from road users to local communities and spur eco-friendly economic growth and development.

#### Do you know?

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is awaiting a final nod from the Ministry of Defense (MoD) to start its drone-monitoring project for combating wildlife poaching and human-animal conflict. The NTCA has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) to start monitoring by drones in five tiger reserves (TRs) — Panna, Corbett, Kaziranga, Sundarbans and Sathyamangalam, and the permission being sought is to fly the drones only within the boundary of the core area of these reserves.

## **25.7 CHEMICAL SAFETY**

• Government has notified two rules viz. Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 and Chemical Accidents (Emergency Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996 for ensuring chemical safety in the Country. These Rules delineate the criteria for identification of Major Accident Hazard (MAH) unit, As per these Rules, an off- site emergency plan for a district having MAH unit is required to be in place so as to mitigate the impact of chemical accidents. As per the information received from various Sate and Union Territories, there are 1,861 MAH units in the Country, located in 303 districts.

## **25.8 COASTAL REGULATION ZONE, 2011**

(ii) Densely populated rural areas to be afforded greater opportunity for development: For CRZ-III (Rural) areas, two separate categories have now been stipulated as below:

9000000

SHANKAR **IAS ACADEMY** 

- (a) CRZ-III A These are densely populated rural areas with a population density of 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census. Such areas shall have a No Development Zone (NDZ) of 50 meters from the HTL as against 200 meters from the High Tide Line stipulated in the CRZ Notification, 2011 since such areas have similar characteristics as urban areas.
- (b) CRZ-III B Rural areas with population density of below 2161 per square kilometre as per 2011 Census. Such areas shall continue to have an NDZ of 200 meters from the HTL.
- (iii) Tourism infrastructure for basic amenities to be promoted: Temporary tourism facilities such as shacks, toilet blocks, change rooms, drinking water facilities etc. have now been permitted in Beaches. Such temporary tourism facilities are also now permissible in the "No Development Zone" (NDZ) of the CRZ-III areas as per the Notification. However, a minimum distance of 10 m from HTL should be maintained for setting up of such facilities.
- (iv) CRZ Clearances streamlined: The procedure for CRZ clearances has been streamlined. Only such projects/activities, which are located in the CRZ-I (Ecologically Sensitive Areas) and CRZ IV (area covered between Low Tide Line and 12 Nautical Miles seaward) shall be dealt with for CRZ clearance by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The powers for clearances with respect to CRZ-II and III have been delegated at the State level with necessary guidance.
- (v) A No Development Zone (NDZ) of 20 meters has been stipulated for all Islands: For islands close to the main land coast and for all Backwater Islands in the main land, in wake of space limitations and unique geography of such regions, bringing uniformity in treatment of such regions, NDZ of 20 m has been stipulated.

- (vi) All Ecologically Sensitive Areas have been accorded special importance: Specific guidelines related to their conservation and management plans have been drawn up as a part of the CRZ Notification.
- (vii) Pollution abatement has been accorded special focus: In order to address pollution in Coastal areas treatment facilities have been made permissible activities in CRZ-1 B area subject to necessary safeguards.
- (viii) Defence and strategic projects have been accorded necessary dispensation.

## 25.9 ISLAND PROTECTION ZONE NOTIFICATION, 2011

Why is a separate Island Protection Zone Notification, 2011 required?

There are about 500 islands in Andaman & Nicobar and about 30 in Lakshadweep.These two groups of oceanic islands are home to some of the country's mostthriving biodiversity hotspots. The A&N Islands are known for their terrestrial andmarine biodiversity including forest area which covers 85% of the Andaman andNicobar geographical area, while, Lakshadweep is a coral island. The geographicalareas of these islands are so small that in most of the cases the 500 metresCoastal Regulation Zone regulations overlap. Hence, a separate Notificationis being issued which takes into account the management of the entire island(except for four islands of A&N which include North Andaman, Middle Andaman, South Andaman and Great Nicobar).

The main objectives of the IPZ Notification, 2011are:

- To ensure livelihood security to the fishing communities, tribals and otherlocal communities living in the coastal areas;
- To conserve and protect coastal stretches and;
- To promote development in a sustainable manner based on scientificprinciples, taking into account the dangers of natural hazards in the coastalareas and sea level rise due to global warming

## 25.10 SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT **RULES, 2016**

62 million tonnes of waste is generated annually in the country at present, out of which 5.6 million tonnes is plastic waste, 0.17 million tonnes is biomedical waste, hazardous waste generation is 7.90 million tonnes per annum and 15 lakh tonne is e-waste. The per capita waste generation in Indian cities ranges from 200 grams to 600 grams per day. 43 million TPA is collected, 11.9 million is treated and 31 million is dumped in landfill sites, which means that only about 75-80% of the municipal waste gets collected and only 22-28 % of this waste is processed and treated. "Waste generation will increase from 62 million tonnes to about 165 million tonnes in 2030".

Scientific disposal of solid waste through segregation, collection and treatment and disposal in an environmentally sound manner minimises the adverse impact on the environment. The local authorities are responsible for the development of infrastructure for collection, storage, segregation, transportation, processing and disposal of MSW.

The Rules are now applicable beyond Municipal areas and extend to urban agglomerations, census towns, notified industrial townships, areas under the control of Indian Railways, airports, airbase, Port and harbour, defence establishments, special economic zones, State and Central government organizations, places of pilgrims, religious & historical importance.

The source segregation of waste has been mandated

to channelize the waste to wealth by recovery, reuse and recycle.

Integration of waste pickers/ ragpickers and waste dealers/ Kabadiwalas in the formal system should be done by State Governments, and Self Help Group, or any other group to be formed.

No person should throw, burn, or bury the solid waste generated by him, on streets, open public spaces outside his premises, or in the drain, or water bodies.

Generator will have to pay 'User Fee' to waste collector and for 'Spot Fine' for Littering and Nonsegregation.

Unscientific disposal of hazardous and other waste through burning or incineration leads to emission of toxic fumes comprising of Dioxins & Furans, Mercury, heavy metals, causing air pollution and associated health-related problems. Disposal in water bodies, or in municipal dumps leads to toxic releases due to leaching in land and water entailing into degradation of soil and water quality. The workers employed in such unscientific practices suffer from neurological disorders, skin diseases, genetic defects, cancer etc. Hence, there is a need for systematic management of hazardous and other waste in an environmentally sound manner by way of prevention, minimisation, re-use, recycling, recovery, utilisation including coprocessing and safe disposal of waste.

Scientific disposal of hazardous waste through collection, storage, packaging, transportation and treatment, in an environmentally sound manner minimises the adverse impact on human health and on the environment. The hazardous waste can be disposed at captive treatment facility installed by the individual waste generators or at Common Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs).

For the first time, Rules have been made to distinguish between Hazardous Waste and other wastes. Other wastes include: Waste tyre, paper waste, metal scrap, used electronic items, etc. and are recognized as a resource for recycling and reuse. These resources supplement the industrial processes and reduce the load on the virgin resource of the country.

### The salient features

The decline in vulture population has had other indirect costs, too. Anecdotal evidence shows that the population of secondary scavengers such as dogs, jackals and rodents has been increasing. This might be leading to increased expenditure on diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis in humans and canine distemper in tigers. Besides, the increase in feral dogs' population and the change in their feeding habits might also have an impact on the prey base for large wild cats like the tiger in future.

#### WASTE 25.13 BIO - MEDICAL **MANAGEMENT RULES, 2016**

 $0^{\circ}$  8000

Biomedical waste comprises human & animal anatomical waste, treatment apparatus likeneedles, syringes and other materials used in health care facilities in the process of treatment and research. This waste is generated during diagnosis, treatment or immunisation in hospitals, nursing homes, pathological laboratories, blood bank, etc. Total biomedical waste generation in the country is 484 TPD from 1,68,869 healthcare facilities (HCF), out of which 447 TPD is treated.

The hospitals servicing 1000 patients or more per month are required to obtain authorisation and segregate biomedical waste in to 10 categories, pack five colour backs for disposal.

The quantum of waste generated in India is estimated to be 1-2 kg per bed per day in a hospital and 600 gm per day per bed in a clinic. 85% of the hospital waste is non-hazardous, 15% is infectious/hazardous. Mixing of hazardous results in to contamination and makes the entire waste hazardous. Hence there is necessity to segregate and treat. Improper disposal increases risk of infection; encourages recycling of prohibited disposables and disposed drugs; and develops resistant microorganisms

Scientific disposal of Biomedical Waste through segregation, collection and treatment in an environmentally sound manner minimises the adverse impact on health workers and on the environment.

## 25.15 PLASTIC WASTE MANAGEMENT **RULES, 2016**

15, 000 tonnes of plastic waste is generated every day, out of which 9, 000 tonnes is collected and processed, but 6, 000 tonnes of plastic waste is not being collected.

An eco-friendly product, which is a complete substitute of the plastic in all uses, has not been found till date. In the absence of a suitable alternative, it is impractical and undesirable to impose a blanket ban on the use of plastic all over the country. The real challenge is to improve plastic waste management systems.

## **Salient features**

SHANKAR<br>IAS ACADEMY

- 1. Increase minimum thickness of plastic carry bags from 40 to 50 microns and stipulate minimum thickness of 50 micron for plastic sheets also to facilitate collection and recycle of plastic waste.

## **25.16 WETLANDS (CONSERVATION** AND MANAGEMENT) RULES 2017

Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 supersede the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010 for effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country

### **Key features**

Decentralisation of wetland management. Under the new rules, the powers have been given to the State governments so that protection and conservation can be done at the local level. The central government has mainly retained powers regarding monitoring.

The new rules have replaced the Central Wetlands Regulatory Authority (CWRA) with the National Wetland Committee, which has a merely advisory role.

The State or UT Wetlands Authority will have to prepare a list of all wetlands and also will develop a comprehensive list of activities to be regulated and permitted within notified wetlands and their zone of influence.

The new rules also prohibit encroachments on wetlands, solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated waste and effluents from industries and human settlements.

It prescribes that conservation and management would be based on the principle of wise use, which is to be determined by the Wetlands Authority.

### **Shortfalls**

0000000

We have earlier read the definition of wetland given by Ramsar convention earlier in this topic. The 2010 wetland rules followed the definition of Ramsar convention.

However, the 2017 rules, in the definition of wetland do not include river channels, paddy fields, manmade water bodies/tanks specifically for drinking water purposes and structures specifically constructed for aquaculture, salt production, recreation, and irrigation purposes.

By this new definition (exclusion of aforesaid wetlands) close to 65 % wetland in the country will lose the status of wetlands. The management and protection awarded to river channels, man-made wetlands will be no more effective as they are not considered wetlands.

The definition of wetlands and its inclusion is done by the respective state/ UT. This may lead to a lack of uniformity in defining and conserving the wetlands in the country.

The older provision of appealing to the National Green Tribunal does not exist in the 2017 Rules.

There is also no timeline specified for phasing out solid waste and untreated waste from being dumped into wetlands.

The new rules do not take into account the Jagpal Singh vs State of Punjab (2011) judgment of Supreme Court for the restoration of encroached wetlands throughout the country.

Key to wetland conservation is not just understanding regimes of multiple uses but conserving and managing the integrity of the wetland ecosystem.
