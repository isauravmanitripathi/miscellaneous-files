# INDIA AND CLIMATE CHANGE

### **22.1. INDIA'S POSITION ON CLIMATE CHANGE**

- India emitted 2,136.84 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases in 2010.
- Energy sector was the prime contributor to emissions and with 71% of total emissions in 2010. Energy sector includes - electricity production, fuel combustion in industries, transport and fugitive emissions.
- Industrial processes and product use contributed 8%; agriculture and waste sectors contributed 18% and 3% respectively to the national GHG inventory.
- About 12% of emissions were offset by carbon sink action of forests and croplands, considering which the national GHG emissions are arrived at a total of 1,884.31 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
- India's per capita GHG emission in 2010 was 1.56 tCO2 equivalent, which is less than one- third of the world's per capita emissions and far below than many developed and developing countries.
- A reduction of emission intensity of GDP by about 12% between 2005 and 2010 has been achieved against our voluntary pledge to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20–25 per cent by 2020, compared with the 2005 level.
- India will continue to be a low-carbon economy (World Bank study).
- India's primary focus is on "adaptation", with specific focus for "mitigation".
- India has already unveiled a comprehensive National Action Plan on Climate Change whose activities are in the public domain.
- India advocates collaborative research in future lowcarbon technology and access to intellectual property rights (IPRs) as global public goods.

### **22.2. OBSERVED CLIMATE AND WEATHER CHANGES IN INDIA**

• India's National Communication (NATCOM) to UNF-CCC has consolidated some of the observed changes in climate parameters in India. No firm link between the documented changes described below and warming due to anthropogenic climate change has yet been established.

### **22.2.1. Surface Temperature**

• At the national level, increase of  $-$  0.4° C has been observed in surface air temperatures over the past century. A warming trend has been observed along the west coast, in central India, the interior peninsula, and north-eastern India. However, cooling trends have been observed in north-west India and parts of south India.

### **22.2.2. Rainfall**

- While the observed monsoon rainfall at the all-India level does not show any significant trend, regional monsoon variations have been recorded.
- A trend of increasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been found along the west coast, northern Andhra Pradesh, and north-western India (+10% to +12% of the normal over the last 100 years) while a trend of decreasing monsoon seasonal rainfall has been observed over eastern Madhya Pradesh, north-eastern India, and some parts of Gujarat and Kerala (- $6\%$  to  $-8\%$  of the normal over the last 100 years).

#### **22.2.3. Extreme Weather Events**

• Instrument records over the past 130 years do not indicate any marked long-term trend in the frequencies of large-scale droughts and floods. Trends are however observed in multi-decadal periods of more frequent droughts, followed by less severe droughts.

• There has been an overall increasing trend in severe storm incidence along the coast at the rate of 0.011 events per year. While the states of West Bengal and Gujarat have reported increasing trends, a decline has been observed in Orissa.

#### **22.2.4. Rise in Sea Level**

• The records of coastal tide gauges in the north Indian Ocean for more than 40 years, reports that sea level rise was between 1.06-1.75 mm per year. These rates are consistent with 1-2 mm per year global sea level rise estimates of IPCC.

#### **22.2.5. Impacts on Himalayan Glaciers**

- The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice and its glaciers form a source of water for the perennial rivers such as the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra.
- Glacial melt may impact their long-term lean-season flows, with adverse impacts on the economy in terms of water availability and hydropower generation.
- The available monitoring data on Himalayan glaciers indicates that while recession of some glaciers has occurred in some Himalayan regions in recent years, the trend is not consistent across the entire mountain chain. It is accordingly, too early to establish long-term trends, or their causation, in respect of which there are several hypotheses.

#### Do you know?

Tripura is one of the highest CVP (Climate, Vegetation, Precipitation) index zones (a measure of potential productivity) in the country.

#### **22.3. CURRENT ACTIONS FOR ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION**

- Adaptation, in the context of climate change, comprises the measures taken to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change, e.g. relocating the communities living close to the sea shore, for instance, to cope with the rising sea level or switching to crops that can withstand higher temperatures.
- Mitigation comprises measures to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change in the first place, e.g. by switching to renewable sources of energy such as solar energy or wind energy, or nuclear

energy instead of burning fossil fuel in thermal power stations.

• Current Indian government expenditure on adaptation to climate variability, exceeds 2.6% of the GDP, with agriculture, water resources, health and sanitation, forests, coastal-zone infrastructure and extreme weather events, being specific areas of concern.

#### **22.3.1. AGRICULTURE**

• Two risk-financing programmes support adaptation to climate impacts. The Crop Insurance Scheme sup-ports the insurance of farmers against climate risks, and the Credit Support Mechanism facilitates the extension of credit to farmers, especially for crop failure due to climate variability.

#### **22.3.2. CROP IMPROVEMENT**

• The present programmes address measures such as development of arid-land crops and pest management, as well as capacity building of extension workers and NGOs to support better vulnerability reducing practices.

#### **22.3.3. DROUGHT PROOFING**

- The current programmes seek to minimize the adverse effects of drought on production of crops and livestock, and on productivity of land, water and human resources, so as to ultimately lead to drought proofing of the affected areas.
- They also aim to pro¬mote overall economic development and improve the socio-economic conditions of the resource poor and disadvantaged sections inhabiting the programme areas.

#### **22.3.4. FORESTRY**

- India has a strong and rapidly growing afforestation programme. The afforestation process was accelerated by the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which aimed at stopping the clearing and degradation of forests through a strict, centralized control of the rights to use forest land and mandatory requirements of compensatory afforestation in case of any diversion of forest land for any non-forestry purpose.
- In addition an aggressive afforestation and sustainable forest management programme resulted in annual reforestation of 1.78 mha during 1985-1997, and is currently 1.1 mha annually. Due to this, the carbon stocks in Indian forests have increased over the last 20 years (during 1986 to 2005) to 9 -10 gigatons of carbon (GtC).

#### **22.3.5. WATER**

• The National Water Policy stresses that non-conventional methods for utilization of water, including interbasin transfers, artificial recharge of groundwater, and desalination of brackish or sea water, as well as traditional water conservation practices like rainwater harvesting, including roof-top rainwater harvesting, should be practised to increase the utilizable water resources. Many states now have mandatory water harvesting programmes in several cities.

#### **22.3.6. COASTAL REGIONS**

- In coastal regions, restrictions have been imposed in the area between 200m and 500m of the HTL (high tide line) while special restrictions have been imposed in the area up to 200m to protect the sensitive coastal ecosystems and prevent their exploitation.
- This, simultaneously, addresses the concerns of the coastal population and their livelihood. Some specific measures taken in this regard include construction of coastal protection infrastructure and cyclone shelters, as well as plantation of coastal forests and mangroves.

#### **22.3.7. HEALTH**

• The prime objective present of health programmes is the surveillance and control of vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Kala-azar, Japanese Encephalitis, Filaria and Dengue. Programmes also provide for emergency medical relief in the case of natural calamities, and to train and develop human resources for these tasks.

#### **22.3.8. DISASTER MANAGEMENT**

• The National Disaster Management programme provides grants-in-aid to victims of weather related disasters, and manages disaster relief operations. It also supports proactive disaster prevention programmes, including dissemination of information and training of disaster-management staff.

#### Do you know?

A Chapter on Sustainable Development and Climate Change has been for the first time introduced in the annual Economic Survey. This new chapter reflects the growing challenges of sustainable development and climate change. Pressures on land, air, water, forests and loss of plant and animal habitant are growing.

#### **22.4. INDIA'S NATIONAL ACTION PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE**

In dealing with the challenge of climate change we must act on several fronts in a focused manner simultaneously. The National Action Plan hinges on the development and use of new technologies. The implementation of the Plan would be through appropriate institutional mechanisms suited for effective delivery of each individual Mission's objectives and include public private partnerships and civil society action. The focus will be on promoting understanding of climate change, adaptation and mitigation, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation.

There are Eight National Missions which form the core of the National Action Plan, representing multipronged, longterm and integrated strategies for achieving key goals in the context of climate change.

#### Do you know?

The Economic Survey 2011-12, suggests to make lower carbon sustainable growth a central element of our Twelfth Five Year Plan commencing in April 2012. The Survey points out that India's per capita  $\mathrm{CO}_\mathrm{_2}$  emissions are much lower (1.52  $CO_2$  tons) than those of the developed countries even if historical emissions are excluded.

#### **22.4.1. NATIONAL SOLAR MISSION**

• The National Solar Mission is a major initiative of the Government of India and State Governments to promote ecologically sustainable growth while addressing India's energy security challenge.

#### **Objective**

#### **22.5 INDC**

Conference of Parties (COP) of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at 19th Session held in Warsaw in November 2013 invited all Parties to initiate domestic preparations for their INDC towards achieving the objective of the Convention and to communicate them, well in advance of the 21st session of the Conference of Parties.

The concept of 'Nationally Determined Contributions', taking into account the outcomes of both Warsaw COP 19 and Lima COP 20 has to (i) reflect the principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR) and (ii) the Country's contributions must be seen in a balanced and comprehensive context.

India declared a voluntary goal of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20–25%, over 2005 levels by 2020, despite having no binding mitigation obligations as per the Convention. A slew of policy measures to promote low carbon strategies and Renewable Energy have resulted in the decline of emission intensity of our GDP by 12% between 2005 and 2010. It is a matter of satisfaction that United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in its Emission Gap Report 2014 has recognized India as one of the countries on course to achieving its voluntary goal.

INDC outlines the post-2020 climate actions they intend to take under a new international agreement. The INDC centre around India's policies and programmes on promotion of clean energy, especially renewable energy, enhancement of energy efficiency, development of less carbon intensive and resilient urban centres, promotion of waste to wealth, safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network, abatement of pollution and India's efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. It also captures citizens and private sector contribution to combating climate change.

The INDC proposals are on the following:

- a. Sustainable Lifestyles
- b. Cleaner Economic Development
- c. Reduce Emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- d. Increase the Share of Non Fossil Fuel Based Electricity
- e. Enhancing Carbon Sink (Forests)
- f. Adaptation
- g. Mobilizing Finance
- h. Technology Transfer and Capacity Building

In the INDC, the country has focused on adaptation efforts, including:

a) developing sustainable habitats;

- b) optimizing water use efficiency;
- c) creating ecologically sustainable climate resilient agricultural production systems;
- d) safeguarding the Himalayan glaciers and mountain ecosystem; and,
- e) enhancing carbon sinks in sustainably managed forests and implementing adaptation measures for vulnerable species, forest-dependent communities and ecosystems.

#### **India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution: At a Glance**

- An energy labelling programme for appliances was launched in 2006, and comparative star-based labelling has been introduced for fluorescent tube-lights, air conditioners, refrigerators, and distribution transformers.
- The labels provide information about the energy consumption of an appliance, and thus enable consumers to make informed decisions. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency has made it mandatory for refrigerators to display energy efficiency label and is expected to do so for air conditioners as well. The standards and labelling

pro¬gramme for manufacturers of electrical appliances is expected to lead to significant savings in electricity annually.

#### **22.10. ENERGY CONSERVATION BUILDING CODE**

- An Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) was launched in May, 2007, which addresses the design of new, large commercial buildings to optimize the buildings' energy demand based on their location in different climatic zones. Commercial buildings are one of the fastest growing sectors of the Indian economy, reflecting the increasing share of the services sector in the economy.
- Nearly one hundred buildings are already following the Code, and compliance with the Code has been incorporated into the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment requirements for large buildings.
- It has been estimated that if all the commercial space in India every year conform to ECBC norms, energy consumption in this sector can be reduced by 30-40%. Compliance with ECBC norms is voluntary at present but is expected to soon become mandatory.

#### **22.10.1. Green Building**

- Buildings are one of the major pollutants that affect urban air quality and contribute to climate change.
- Human Habitats (Buildings) interact with the environment in various ways. Throughout their life cycles, from construction to operation and then demolition, they consume resources in the form of energy, water, materials, etc. and emit wastes either directly in the form of municipal wastes or indirectly as emissions from electricity generation.
- Green building is the essence of which would be to address all the pollution related issues of a building in an integrated and scientific manner.
- A green building depletes as little of the natural resources during its construction and operation.
- The aim of a green building design is to:
  - Minimize the demand on non-renewable resources and maximize the utilization efficiency of these resources when in use, and
  - Maximize reuse and recycling of available resources
  - Utilization of renewable resources.
- It costs a little more to design and construct a green building.

- However, it costs less to operate a green building that has tremendous environmental benefits and provides a better place for the occupants to live and work in.
- It maximizes the use of efficient building materials and construction practices; optimizes the use of on-site sources and sinks by bio-climatic architectural practices; uses minimum energy to power itself; uses efficient equipment to meet its lighting, air-conditioning, and other needs; maximizes the use of renewable sources of energy; uses efficient waste and water management practices; and provides comfortable and hygienic indoor working conditions.
- It is evolved through a design process that requires all concerned (the architect and landscape designer and the air conditioning, electrical, plumbing, and energy consultants) to work as a team to address all aspects of building and system planning, design, construction, and operation.
- They critically evaluate the impacts of each design decision on the environment and arrive at viable design solutions to minimize the negative impacts and enhance the positive impacts on the environment.
- In sum, the following aspects of the building design are looked into in an integrated way in a green building:
  - Building system designed in a way to efficiently use HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning), lighting, electrical, and water heating.
  - Integration of renewable energy sources to generate energy onsite.

#### **22.10.2. Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA)**

- GRIHA is a Sanskrit word meaning 'Abode'.
- GRIHA has been conceived by TERI and developed jointly with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.
- The green building rating system devised by TERI and the MNRE is a voluntary scheme.

#### **Objective**

• The primary objective of the rating system is to help design green buildings and, in turn, help evaluate the 'greenness' of the buildings.

#### **Aim**

• The rating system aims to achieve efficient resource utilization, enhanced resource efficiency, and better quality of life in the buildings.

#### **Rating Tool**

- GRIHA is a rating tool that helps people assess the performance of their building against certain nationally acceptable benchmarks and is suitable for all kinds of buildings in different climatic zones of the country.
- Going by the old adage 'what gets measured, gets managed', GRIHA attempts to quantify aspects such as energy consumption, waste generation, renewable energy adoption, etc. so as to manage, control and reduce the same to the best possible extent.
- It will evaluate the environmental performance of a building holistically over its entire life cycle, thereby providing a definitive standard for what constitutes a 'green building'.
- The rating system, based on accepted energy and environmental principles, will seek to strike a balance between the established practices and emerging concepts, both national and international.
- The guidelines/criteria appraisal may be revised every three years to take into account the latest scientific developments during this period.

#### **The basic features**

- The system has been developed to help 'design and evaluate' new buildings (buildings that are still at the inception stages).
- A building is assessed based on its predicted performance over its entire life cycle – inception through operation.
- The stages of the life cycle that have been identified for evaluation are:

#### **Rating system**

- GRIHA rating system consists of 34 criteria categorized under 4 categories.
- They are
  - 1. Site Selection and Site Planning,
  - 2. Conservation and efficient utilization of resources,
  - 3. Building operation and maintenance, and
  - 4. Innovation points.
- Eight of these 34 criteria are mandatory, four are partly mandatory, while the rest are optional. Each criterion has a number of points assigned to it.
- It means that a project intending to meet the criterion would qualify for the points. Different levels of certification (one star to five stars) are awarded based on the number of points earned. The minimum points required for certification is 50.

Medini Puraskar Yojana - This award is given to Indian authors each year to encourage original works in Hindi on environment and its related subjects such as wildlife, water resources and conservation

#### **The benefits**

- On a broader scale, this system, along with the activities and processes that lead up to it, will benefit the community at large with the improvement in the environment by reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, reducing energy consumption and the stress on natural resources.
  - Reduced energy consumption without sacrificing the comfort levels
  - Reduced destruction of natural areas, habitats, and biodiversity, and reduced soil loss from erosion etc.
  - Reduced air and water pollution (with direct health benefits)

- Reduced water consumption
- Limited waste generation due to recycling and reuse
- Reduced pollution loads
- Increased user productivity
- Enhanced image and marketability

#### **The challenges**

- The Indian building industry is highly de-centralized with people and/ or groups engaged in design, construction, equipment provision, installation, and renovation working together.
- Each group may be organized to some extent, but there is limited interaction among the groups, thus disabling the integrated green design and application process.
- Hence, it is very important to define and quantify sustainable building practices and their benefits.
- It is also important to separate the role of different participants in ensuring that the building consumes minimal resources over its entire life cycle and leaves behind a minimal environmental footprint.
