# ANIMAL DIVERSITY OF INDIA

### Do you know?

• India has been ranked as seventh most environmentally hazardous country in the world. The study is based on evaluation of "absolute" environment impact of 179 countries, done by researchers in Harvard, Princeton, Adelaide University and University of Singapore on January, 2011. Brazil was found to be worst on environmental indicators followed by united states and china whereas Singapore was the best.

### **12.1. MAMMALS - CRITICALLY ENDANGERED**

#### **12.1.1. Pygmy Hog (Porcula salvania)**

- Is the world's smallest wild pig, with adults weighing only 8 kgs. This species constructs a nest throughout the year.
- It is one of the most useful indicators of the management status of grassland habitats. The grasslands where the pygmy hog resides are crucial for the survival of other endangered species such as Indian Rhinoceros, Swamp Deer, Wild Buffalo, Hispid Hare, Bengal Florican and Swamp Francolin.
- In 1996, a captive-breeding programme of the species was initiated in Assam, and some hogs were reintroduced in Sonai Rupai area in 2009.
- Habitat: Relatively undisturbed, tall 'terai' grasslands.
- Distribution: Formerly, the species was more widely distributed along the southern Himalayan foothills but now is restricted to only a single remnant population in Manas Wildlife Sanctuary and its buffer reserves.
- Pygmy hog-sucking Louse (Haematopinus oliveri), a parasite that feeds only on Pygmy Hogs will also fall in

the same risk category of critically endangered as its survival is linked to that of the host species.

• Threats: The main threats are loss and degradation of grasslands, dry-season burning, livestock grazing and afforestation of grasslands. Hunting is also a threat to the remnant populations.

#### Do you know?

Penguins don't live near freshwater. they drink salt water. They have a special gland in their bodies that takes the salt out of the water they drink and pushes it out of grooves in their bill. A handy in-house filtration system!

#### Do you know?

Frog's tongues are attached to the front of their mouths rather than at the back like humans. When a frog catches an insect it throws its sticky tongue out of it's mouth and wraps it around its prey. The frog's tongue then snaps back and throws the food down its throat.

#### Do you know?

Cobras are cannibals, which mean that they will eat other snakes along birds, bird eggs and small mammals

#### Do you know?

Sharks have the most powerful jaws on the planet. Both the upper and lower jaws move. It tosses its head back and forth to tear loose a piece of meat which it swallows whole.

#### Do you know?

- When male frogs are ready to mate they will 'call' out to the female frogs. Each different species of frog has their own special sound and that is the sound that the same species of female frog will answer to. Some frogs are so loud they can be heard a mile away!
- Frogs and toads are carnivores
- Some frogs are very good at camouflaging themselves so that they blend in with their environment, making it harder for their enemies to find them. A frog can change the colour of its skin depending on its surroundings.

- Threat coastal development, red tide, hunting.

### **12.3. FEW EXCEPTIONS**

#### **12.3.1. Egg Laying Mammals**

The unique feature of monotremes, a sub division of mammal, is that monotremes lay eggs rather than giving birth to their young. There are only five living Monotreme/ egg laying Mammals species: they are - the duck-billed platypus and four species of spiny anteaters (also known as echidna). All of them are found only in Australia and New Guinea.

#### **Echidnas are also known as spiny ant eaters.**

- Habitat / distribution Australia and New Guinea
- In echidnas, the egg is carried in a pouch on the female's belly until the young hatches, at which point the barelydeveloped young must find a mammary gland and latch onto it for nourishment.

#### **Platypus is a semi-aquatic mammal.**

- Habitat / distribution endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania.
- In the platypus, the female retires to a burrow in the bank of a river or pond. The burrow is lined with dry vegetation, and there the eggs are laid.
- The male platypus has venom strong enough to can kill a small dog, or cause excruciating pain among humans.

#### **12.3.2. Marsupials**

- Marsupials are the group of mammals commonly thought of as pouched mammals (like the wallaby and kangaroo).
- Marsupial mammals have placenta but it is very shortlived and does not make as much of a contribution to www.freeupscn fetal nourishment.

- They give birth very early and the young animal, essentially a helpless embryo, climbs from the mother's birth canal to the nipples.
- There it grabs on with its mouth and continues to develop, often for weeks or months depending on the species.
- They do not have long gestation times like placental mammals. The short gestation time is due to having a yolk-type placenta in the mother marsupial.
- Extinct Marsupial quagga, the marsupial wolf .
- Placental mammals all bear live young, which are nourished before birth in the mother's uterus through a specialized embryonic organ attached to the uterus wall, the placenta.
- Placental mammals nourish the developing embryo using the mother's blood supply, allowing longer gestation times.

#### **List of Marsupials**

- Habitat: Grasslands occasionally interspersed with scrublands.
- Distribution: Native to only 3 countries in the world Cambodia, India and Nepal. In India, it occurs in 3 states, namely Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.
- Threats: Ongoing conversion of the bird's grassland habitat for various purposes including agriculture is mainly responsible for its population decline.

#### **12.4.5. The Himalayan Quail**

- It is presumed to be extinct since no reliable records of sightings of this species exist after 1876. Intensive surveys are required as this species is hard to detect due to its reluctance to fly and its preference for dense grass habitats. Possible sighting of this species was reported in Nainital in 2003.
- Habitat: Tall grass and scrub on steep hillsides.
- Distribution: Western Himalayas.
- Threats: Indiscriminate hunting during the colonial period along with habitat modification.

- Threats: Conversion of habitat to arable land, illegal hunting and proximity to human settlements.

#### Do you know?

Some trees can "talk" to each other. When willows are attacked by webworms and caterpillars, they emit a chemical that alerts nearby willow of the danger. The neighboring trees then respond by pumping more tannin into their leaves making it difficult for the insects to digest the leaves.

#### **12.4.8. Spoon Billed Sandpiper**

• It requires highly specialized breeding habitat, a constraint that has always kept its population scarce. India is home to some of the last existing wintering grounds of this species.

- Habitat: Coastal areas with sparse vegetation. No breeding records further inland than 7 km from the seashore.
- Distribution: Has been recorded in West Bengal, Orissa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
- Threats: Habitat degradation and land reclamation. Human disturbance also leads to high incidence of nest desertion.

#### **12.8.9. Siberian Crane**

- Habitat: Wetland areas.
- Located distribution: Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan.
- Threats: Pesticide pollution, wetland drainage, development of prime habitat into agricultural fields, and to some extent, hunting.

#### Do you know?

The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 while seeking to protect the rights of plant breeders, as mandated under TRIPS, has in an innovative fashion, managed to provide 'rights' to the Indian farmer.

#### Do you know?

- 1. Roots store more starch than the trunk.
- 2. Roots do not have a central pith (soft central tissue) while the trunk does.
- 3. The majority of tree roots are non-woody. These nonwoody roots only live for a few weeks.
- 4. The root hairs grow within days, when water, temperature, and nutrients are available to promote growth.

### **12.5. CORALS**

#### **12.5.1. Fire corals**

- They are more closely related to jellyfish than corals. On contact, one usually feels a burning sensation similar to a sting from a jellyfish.
- Habitat: Generally found in murky inshore waters and display a tolerance for siltation. They often are found in clear offshore sites.
- Distribution: Indonesia, Gulf of Chiriquí, Panama Pacific Province. Possibly extinct from Australia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Panama, Singapore and Thailand.
- Threats: Collected for decoration and jewellery trade. This group is also sensitive to temperature rise, and is thought to have completely disappeared from the majority of marine areas possibly because of growing global warming related bleaching effects.

#### **12.6. BIRD'S MIGRATION**

• Migration refers to the regular, recurrent and cyclical seasonal movement of birds from one place to other. The distance of migration ranged from short distance to thousands of kilometers. But at the end of period, birds will eventually return to the original place.

### **12.8. SPECIES EXTINCTION**

- Extinction is caused through various processes:
  - Deterministic processes that have a cause and effect. E.g. glaciations, human interference such as deforestation.
  - Stochastic processes (chance and random events) that effect the survival and reproduction of individuals. E.g. unexpected changes of weather patterns, decreased food supply, disease, increase of competitors, predators or parasites, etc. that may act independently or add to deterministic effects.
- The impact of these processes will of course depend on the size and degree of genetic diversity and resilience of populations.
- Traits that adversely affect or increase a species vulnerability to extinction due to habitat fragmentation have been identified. These are:
  - rarity or low abundance
  - poor dispersal ability
  - ecological specialization

All Rights Reserved. No part of this material may be reproduced in any form or by any means, without permission in writing.

- high trophic status as animals occupying a higher trophic level (i.e. the position of a species in a food chain) usually have smaller populations than those at lower levels (e.g. carnivores are fewer in number than herbivores)
- low adult survival rates
- low intrinsic rate population increase
- Body size, fecundity, dietary specialization.

#### **12.8.1. Natural extinctions**

- Have been caused due to several factors:
  - continent drifting,
  - climate change,
  - tectonic activity
  - increased volcanic activity
  - The late Ordovician global glaciations (439 Mya).
  - The late Cretaceous extinction assumed to be associated with an extra-terrestrial impact.
- Extinction in vascular plants has been more gradual compared with the loss of animals. It is believed that extinction among this group was due more to competitive displacement by more advanced plant forms, or due to a gradual climate change, than due to any sudden catastrophic event.

#### **12.8.2. Artificial Extinction**

- Even though species extinction is a natural process which can happen without the intervention of humans, extinctions caused by humans is now happening over and above the reasonable estimate of natural extinction rates.
- Species are threatened with extinction by the intervention of humans due to:
  - direct causes such as hunting, collection or capture and persecution
  - Indirect causes such as habitat loss, modification and fragmentation and the introduction of invasive species.

#### **12.9. MAN - ANIMAL CONFLICT**

• It refers to the interaction between wild animals and people and the resultant negative impact on people or their resources, or wild animals or their habitat. It occurs when wildlife needs overlap with those of human populations, creating costs to residents and wild animals.

#### **Causes**

- Human population growth
- Land use transformation
- Species habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation
- Increasing livestock populations and competitive exclusion of wild herbivores
- Growing interest in ecotourism and increasing access to nature reserves
- Abundance and distribution of wild prey
- Increasing wildlife population as a result of conservation programmes
- Climatic factors
- Stochastic events (e.g. fire)

#### **Impacts**

- Crop damage
- Livestock depredation
- Injuries to people
- Loss of human life
- Damage to property
- Injuries to wildlife
- Animal deaths
- Destruction of habitat

#### **Preventive strategies**

- Artificial and natural barriers (physical and biological)
- Guarding
- Alternative high-cost livestock husbandry practices
- Relocation: voluntary human population resettlement
- Waste management systems that restrict wildlife access to refuse

#### **Mitigative strategies**

- Compensation systems
- Insurance programmes
- Incentive programmes
- Community based natural resource management schemes (CBNRMS)
- Regulated harvest
- Increase alternate crops, preys or water points
- Wildlife translocation
- Conservation education for local populations
- Better sharing of information.
