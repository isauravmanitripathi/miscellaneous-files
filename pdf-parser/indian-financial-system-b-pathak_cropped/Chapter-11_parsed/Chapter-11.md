## **INTRODUCTION**

The Indian financial system has undergone a significant transformation in the 1990s. The deregulation of lending rates, free pricing of equity issues, entry of private sector institutional investors including foreign institutional investors, opening up of the banking sector to the private sector, allowing Indian companies to directly tap the foreign capital markets, and so on are some of the major reforms which have changed the scenario of the Indian financial system. This new found freedom has increased competition in the Indian corporate sector.

The capital market is an important source of meeting the growing long-term financial requirements of corporates, both in private and public sectors.

On the one hand, due to the colossal fund requirements of both corporates and financial institutions, the competition has become intense among the various classes of issuers to corner a share of the investors' funds, and on the other hand, investors are proving to be increasingly finicky and savvy. Hence, to cater to the differing requirements of both issuers and investors, it has become essential for issuers (borrowers) to innovate and design new financial instruments. Financial engineering has been at the back of these innovations, which have revolutionalized the business world.

# **What is a New Financial Instrument?**

A new financial instrument may be one which has some new features in the terms of agreement, when compared with the features of presently available instruments. Very few financial instruments are completely new products. Many are just new features added to the conventional financial instruments to make them marketable. The conventional financial instruments are equity shares, preference shares, debentures—partly convertible, fully convertible, and non-convertible. When certain new features like attaching a warrant to the non-convertible portion of a debenture are added, a conventional instrument turns into a new instrument.

# **Reasons for Innovations in Financial Instruments**

- Every product needs constant re-engineering. Moreover, it has to be tailored according to the needs of the consumers. The investment environment does not get a boost if there are repeated offerings of the same product. Hence, new designs of financial products are always needed.
- The interest rates had declined and this trend forced the corporate world to think of new financial instruments.
- Investors also prefer not to be saddled with long-term instruments. Hence, instruments with varying maturity periods and with various put and call options are preferred.
- The old trend of getting finance from financial institutions has changed. Now companies prefer the capital market as a source of finance. To successfully tap capital markets, companies are compelled to offer attractive terms even on debt securities, in order to raise funds.

• Investors have shied away from the equity market in the last few years due to various capital market scams. Attractive financial instruments are needed to lure these investors back.

In the post-reforms period, a host of innovative instruments have been introduced in the capital market. Most of these instruments are debt instruments. These instruments have not only been structured and designed properly, they have also been successfully marketed at the retail level.

#### **NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

#### **Floating Rate Bonds**

The interest rate on these bonds is linked to a benchmark/anchor rate and is not fixed. It is a concept which has been introduced primarily to take care of the falling market or to provide a cushion in times of falling interest rates in the economy. It helps the issuer to hedge the loss arising due to interest rate fluctuations.

In India, the State Bank of India (SBI) was the first to introduce bonds with floating rates for retail investors. The SBI floating rate bonds were linked to the bank's term deposit rate which served as an anchor rate. The treasury bill rate can also be the anchor rate. The interest rate is linked to the anchor rate as it reflects the economic indicators. The NSE Mibor is used now-a-days as the anchor rate for floating rate bonds.

To make this bond attractive to investors, the interest rate always has a fixed mark-up price over and above the anchor rate. In case of IDBI bond issues, the fixed mark-up was 2 per cent and the anchor rate was the 364-days treasury bill rate.

Floating rate bonds ensure that neither the borrower nor the lender suffer due to volatile interest rates. If the interest rate rises, the lender (investor) benefits, as he earns a higher interest and if the interest rate falls, it is advantageous to the borrower, as he can raise funds at a low cost.

Borrower companies issue floating rate bonds with a cap or a floor. The cap is the maximum interest that the issuer can pay while the floor is the minimum interest that a subscriber earns, leading to an advantage, both to the issuer and the subscriber.

Most of the outstanding government market loans are in the form of plain vanilla fixed rate bonds. The government issued, in November/December 2001, two floating rate bonds with maturity periods of 5 years and 8 years for a total amount of  $\overline{55,000}$  crore in view of the asset-liability management (ALM) and risk-weight needs of the major investors such as banks. FRBs serve as diversifying instruments in debt management as they take advantage of the term premium while minimizing the refinancing risk. However, FRBs are vulnerable to interest rate risk.

FRB is an innovative instrument in a falling interest rate regime but it requires an active secondary debt market.

• Zero interest bonds carry no periodic interest payment and are sold at a huge discount to face value.

#### **Zero Interest Bonds**

As the name suggests, there is no periodic interest payment and they are sold at a huge discount to the face value. These bonds benefit both the issuers and the investors by limiting funding cost when interest rates are volatile for the issuer and by reducing the reinvestment risk for the investor. Zero coupon bonds are sometimes convertible into equity on maturity which entails no outflow for the issuer, or into a regular interest bearing bond after a particular period of time.

Companies such as Mahindra and Mahindra, HB Leasing and Finance have been pioneers in introducing these bonds in the Indian market.

These bonds are the best options for individuals and institutional investors who look for safe and good returns and are ready to hold them till the bond matures. Moreover, these bonds do not carry any interest, which is otherwise taxable.

These bonds are attractive for issuer companies with projects having a long gestation period as there is no immediate interest commitment and, on maturity, the bonds can be converted into equity shares or non-convertible debentures depending on the capital structure requirements of the company.

Zero interest bonds require an active secondary debt market for attracting investors.

• Floating Rate Bonds are bonds wherein the interest rate is not fixed and is linked to an anchor/benchmark rate.

#### **Deep Discount Bonds (DDBs)**

A deep discount bond is a zero coupon bond whose maturity is very high, say 15 years onwards and is offered at a discount to the face value. The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) was the first financial institution to offer DDBs in 1992.

The issuers have successfully marketed these bonds by luring the investor to become a 'lakhpati' in 25 years. Moreover, these instruments are embedded with 'call' and 'put' options, providing an early redemption facility both to the issuer and the investor at a predetermined price and date. The issuer becomes free from intermittent cash flow problems and the funds can be deployed in infrastructure projects which involve long gestation periods.

Many variations of DDBs and zero interest bonds have come into the market. Some of them are as follows:

**Zero Interest Secured Premium Convertible Bond** The investor can convert his bond into an equity share at 30 per cent discount on average price at the end of one year. If the conversion price is lower than the face value, the issuer will redeem the difference. A similar option of conversion into two equity shares is available on the maturity of the bond. The bond may also have a warrant attached.

**Zero Interest Fully Convertible Debenture** The investors in these debentures are not paid any interest. However, there is a notified period after which, fully paid, fully convertible debentures (FCDs) will be automatically and compulsorily converted into shares. In the event of a company going for rights issue prior to the allotment of equity, resulting from the conversion of equity shares into FCDs, FCD holders shall be offered securities as may be determined by the company.

#### **Revolving Underwriting Finance Facility (RUFF)**

It is a 91-day debenture with two important, distinct features. These are as follows:

- There is an underwriter (a banker or financial institution) who will be prepared to pick up the lot if it is not fully sold.
- After 91 days, the stock will be rolled over, *i.e.*, the debentures will be redeemed and reauctioned. Through this roll over, the debentures can be kept in the market for upto five years. If, at some stage, the money markets are tight and there are not enough takers for the issue, the underwriters step in and pick up the lot at a previously agreed rate.

The treasury bill rate is the benchmark rate and a premium is added to it to attract the investors. The premium depends on the demand and supply of the 91-day instrument. The overall rate never exceeds the prime lending rate (PLR). This instrument is rated by a credit rating agency.

RUFF is beneficial to the issuers, underwriters, and investors. The issuer gets long-term funds at short-term rates, the underwriter gets a regular fee, and the investor gets a liquid debt instrument.

#### **Auction Rated Debentures (ARDs)**

It is a secured, redeemable (after 90 days), non-convertible instrument with interest determined by the market and placed privately with bids. ARDs are a hybrid of commercial papers and debentures. ANZ Grindlays designed this new instrument for Ashok Leyland Finance (ALF). This was a three-year instrument which had a zero coupon rate and was sold at a discount. The company repurchased the ARDs after three months of the issue and then re-issued them through fresh auctions. The interest rates were negotiated at quarterly auctions; this continued for three years. ALF raised  $\overline{30}$  crore through this unique zero coupon instrument. ARD is technically a short-term instrument but it provides long-term finance for the company.

## **Secured Premium Notes (SPNs) with Detachable Warrants**

This instrument is redeemable after a notified period, of say four to seven years. There is a lock-in period during which no interest is paid. The attached warrants ensure that the holder has the right to apply for • Deep discount bonds are zero coupon bonds with high maturity.

• RUFF is a 91-day debenture which is rolled over after its maturity.

and to be allotted equity shares, provided the SPN is fully paid. This conversion is done within the time limit notified by the company.

The SPN holder has an option to sell back the SPN to the company at par value after the lock-in period. If the holder exercises this option, no interest/premium will be paid on redemption. In case the SPN holder holds it further, he will be repaid the principal amount along with the additional amount of interest/premium on redemption in instalments as decided by the company. SPNs free the firm from the debt-serving costs in the initial years. TISCO and Bombay Dyeing were among the early issuers of SPNs.

#### **Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs) with Detachable Equity Warrants**

The holder of this instrument is given an option to buy a specific number of shares from the company at a pre-determined price and time frame. The warrants attached to the NCDs are issued, subject to full payment of the NCDs value. There is a specific lock-in period after which the detachable warrant holders have to exercise their option to apply for equities. If the option to apply for equities is not exercised, the unapplied portion of shares would be disposed of by the company at its liberty.

Escorts, Bombay Dyeing, and Indian Rayon were among the early issuers of NCDs with warrants attached.

## **Secured Zero Interest Partly Convertible Debentures with Detachable and Separately Tradable Warrants**

This instrument has two parts. Part A is convertible into equity shares at a fixed amount on the date of allotment. Part B is non-convertible, to be redeemed at par at the end of a specific period from the date of allotment. Part B carries a detachable and a separate tradable warrant which will provide an option to the warrant holder to receive an equity share for every warrant held at a price determined by the company.

#### **Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs) with Interest (Optional)**

This instrument will not yield any interest for a specified short time period. After this period, FCD holders have the option to apply for equities at a 'premium' for which no additional amount is payable. This option needs to be indicated in the application form itself. However, interest on FCDs is payable at a determined rate from the date of conversion to the second/final conversion and equity shares are issued in lieu of the interest.

#### **Domestic Convertible Bonds**

These are hybrid securities that allow investors to separate the embedded equity portion from the bond and trade it separately. Because of the option to convert debt into equity, issuers can raise debt at a lower interest rate. These bonds were proposed by the Finance Minister in his 2008–09 budget speech to deepen the corporate bond market. However, this would require policy changes in different regulations and hence, the SEBI proposed an alternative instrument—Non-convertible debentures with detachable warrants. This instrument would help companies raise low-cost debt. It also allows the investors to detach the equity component from the instrument and trade on it.

#### **Differential Shares**

• Differential Shares are a class of shares with differential rights to voting or dividend.

Differential shares are shares with differential rights to voting and dividends. They are a class of shares which carry voting rights with varying rates of dividend. In fact, differential shares can be issued with no voting rights but high dividends or, with varying rights and dividends. If the voting right of the shareholder is taken away, the shareholder is compensated by higher returns. This concept originated in Canada and was highly successful. This concept was introduced in India through the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2000. According to this law, a company can issue shares with differential rights 'as to voting or dividend or otherwise.'

Companies are now allowed to issue shares with differential voting rights including non-voting shares, to the extent of 25 per cent of the total share capital, provided, they had profits that could be distributed, in the preceding three years. However, companies will not be allowed to convert their equity capital, with regular voting rights. into shares with differential voting rights and vice-versa.

Differential shares are positioned between ordinary equity shares and preference shares. The preference shareholders are entitled to certain assured dividends but no voting rights while ordinary equity shareholders have voting rights in proportion to the number of shares held but are not entitled to any assured return.

**Rules for Issue of Differential Shares** The issue of differential voting rights shares has to be approved by shareholders in a general meeting. Further, listed companies are required to obtain the shareholders' approval also through a postal ballot. The issue of such shares has to be authorized by the articles of association of the company.

The companies proposing to issue shares with differential rights should not have been convicted of any offence under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956, and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. The companies which have defaulted in filing annual returns in the preceding three years or have failed to repay deposits or interests thereon or, redeem debentures or pay dividends on the due date, will not be eligible to issue shares with differential rights. Additionally, the companies should not have defaulted in addressing investors' grievances.

A company issuing differential shares should not fail to give dividends for three consecutive years. Otherwise these shares will be converted into equity shares. If the company fails to give dividends for three consecutive years, the investors will not be able to exercise their voting powers during the period and will also not receive any return.

The companies planning to issue such shares will have to append in their notice to the shareholders, an explanatory statement detailing the differences in the rights they will carry, and the scale or in proportion to which the voting rights of such shares or types of shares will differ. Also, the entitlements on rights and/or bonus issues among different classes of shareholders will have to be predetermined and mentioned upfront.

**Benefits of Differential Shares** The differential shares provide varied benefits to both investors and issuers. The majority of the shareholders in India do not bother about the voting rights. Hence, a large section of investors would favour shares without voting rights but with higher dividend entitlements.

The issue of shares with differential rights imparts flexibility to promoters to raise funds without diluting their stakes. The differential shares can be effectively used as an anti-takeover tool. This instrument reduces dependence on outside funds and hence is a good cash management tool for new business firms. The differential shares help in leveraging the capital structure of the issuing company.

Differential shares are more beneficial to the issuers than investors. Investors lose control over the affairs of the company. Moreover, international experience shows that there is a problem of low liquidity with this instrument. Hence, both, the government and the issuer should take initiatives for increasing the liquidity of this instrument.

#### **Securitized Paper**

It is a popular fund-raising technique in the developed markets such as the US and the UK. Asset securitization began in the US in the 1960s with the pooling of residential mortgages. Now, this concept extends to a whole range of financial assets such as receivables and mortgages held by businesses and financial firms.

Securitization is a process by which a company raises money by selling off its receivables. These receivables are sold off to cash-rich investors by converting them into securities. The receivables are sold at a discount to the investors which represents the yield.

Put in simple terms, securitization is a process through which illiquid assets are packaged and converted into tradable securities known as pass-through certificates (PTCs). These securities are also referred to as asset-backed securities (ABSs). If the instrument securitized is a housing loan, the resultant instrument is referred to as mortgage backed securities (MBSs). In case of bond receivables, they are known as collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and in case of industrial loan receivables, they are referred to as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs).

In securitization, the assets to be securitized are identified on the basis of their creditworthiness. Then, the security is rated by a specialized credit rating agency. The pool is sold to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) which acts as a trustee. SPV is the entity that owns the assets once they are securitized. The assets • In a securitization transaction, the originator transfers future receivables to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which in turn, issues securitized instruments called pass through certificates (PTCs) to investors. Pass through certificates are instruments which pass on the cash flows from the underlying loans on a pro-rata basis.

are held by the SPV to ensure that the investors' interest is secure even if the originator goes bankrupt. The SPV is usually in the form of a trust. The SPV issues the asset backed security and the task of collecting the interest due on the underlying asset is left either to the seller or a third party.

An asset backed security can be of four types: pass-through, asset-backed bond, pay-through, and real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A pass through security represent a pro-rata share of assets in a pool wherein principal and interest payments are passed through to investors on a schedule similar to the assets. These assets do not remain on the issuer's balance sheet. An asset backed bond is a debt obligation wherein the schedule of the payment of interest and the principal differs from that of the asset. The assets remain on the issuer's balance sheet. Pay-through assets are similar to the asset-backed bonds except that they do not remain on the issuer's balance sheet. In real estate mortgage investment conduit, the principal and interest payments are passed through to one or more regular classes of securities and one residual class. Assets are transferred to the REMIC in a non-taxable manner. In India, PTCs are issued and are more popular.

The securities can then be listed on the NSE. As the securities are negotiable instruments and listed, they can be traded in the secondary market.

Since the securities are assets for the seller, the process is called asset securitization. However, once it is listed on a stock exchange, it becomes a debt product for the investor and hence, the process is called 'debt' securitization.

The key drivers of securitization are raising low cost funds through new sources in an off the balance sheet manner. For the issuer, once an asset is securitized, it goes off the balance sheet. It offers a higher yield to the investor and adds value to his investment portfolio.

Securitization is far superior to bills discounting or factoring. Bills discounting is a short-term source, while securitization is a medium to long-term source. The quantum of paper work is higher in bills discounting than in securitization. Factoring is quite similar to securitization as the factor buys the receivables of a company at a discount. However, there is no rating or creation of a secondary market in factoring. Moreover, factoring has evolved as a trade financing tool rather than for medium-or long-term financing.

**Securitization Deals** The first securization relating to auto financing took place between Citi Bank and ICICI Bank in 1990–91.

It is more than a decade since this concept was introduced in India but the level of activity was quite low. Only a few corporates and some state electricity boards securitized their assets. Since the onset of the twenty-first century, volumes in securitization have surged up.

ICICI successfully offloaded loan assets worth  $\overline{77,000}$  crore in 2001 to raise funds for the merger with ICICI Bank. This boosted the activity in securitization. In the first quarter of 2002–03, ICICI Bank securitized corporate loans worth  $\bar{\zeta}2,250$  crore and housing loans worth  $\bar{\zeta}50$  crore to meet its statutory liquidity requirements after the merger. The securitization activity got a further boost with the introduction of the 'Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance 2002' which was promulgated in June 2002. This ordinance has given a legal status to securitization as an activity.

In February 2000, Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), securitized assets worth  $\bar{\epsilon}1,500$  crores from its infrastructure portfolio. The municipal corporations across the country have raised more than  $\bar{\mathfrak{g}}600$  crores through securitization or structured obligations.

The current trend among banks and financial institutions is to issue PTCs to off-load illiquid assets from their balance sheets by converting them into marketable securities. This enables the issuers to realise up-front cash which in turn could be utilized for more efficient asset–liability management (ALM) and maintain the capital adequacy ratio.

The increasing popularity of securitization can be known from the number of securitized transactions rated by credit rating agencies. Crisil has rated 14 securitized transaction worth  $\overline{3}363$  crore during April– June 2002–03 as compared to only two transactions worth  $\text{\textsterling}52.7$  crore in April–June 2001–02. Icra too has rated higher transactions in 2002–03.

Securitization is witnessed more in auto-financing than in housing receivables as yield levels are higher in the former. But now the issuers are coming out with a variety of securitization deals. Citibank has securitized bank's personal loan portfolio of  $\overline{z}284.1$  crore. Citibank has also launched an on-tap securitization programme called, Citi SPOT which is a master set of terms and conditions under which companies can undertake a series of multiple securitization issuances in a year. ICICI has introduced 'securitized notes' structure instead of the traditional PTCs. The securitized notes are quite similar to PTCs but they give more flexibility to structure the underlying cash flows to meet the investors' needs. Securitized deals are now being tailor-made for the investors in terms of structure, tenor and coupon rate.

Domestic mutual funds, invested heavily into securitized papers such as asset backed securities (ABS) for trading profits as returns, were diminishing from other fixed income products as well as trading opportunities.

In October 2004, ICICI Bank offloaded 12 per cent of its retail auto loan portfolio through a  $\overline{8823.5}$ crore securitization deal—the largest of its kind in India. The issue consisted of four senior tranches (strips), namely A1, A2, A3, and P strips. Strips A1, A2, and A3 had an average tenor of 7 months, 18 months, and 27 months respectively, while the size of strips A1, A2, A3, and P were  $\overline{268}$  crore, ₹248 crore, ₹111 crore, and ₹198 crore, respectively. ICICI Bank acted as the sole originator, structure, and arranger for private placement.

Private sector banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank securitized retail loans to foreign banks and public sector banks in 2006. Through such sales, they earned liquidity and got additional capital to reinvest in assets further. Increase in the asset base led to a reduction in their operating costs. Moreover, such asset sales enable banks to transact more business without augmenting their regulatory capital.

**Securitization Law** The Ordinance on Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest was promulgated on June 24 2000. The ordinance will help banks and financial institutions to turn their assets in to tradeable securities, in setting up asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to recover their bad assets, and clean their balance sheets to a great extent. This law will also provide for statutory recognition for hypothecation.

To create a market in securitized debt, the government has floated a company called the Asset Reconstruction Company India Ltd. (ARCIL), wherein, the government holds a 49 per cent stake, ICICI a 24.5 per cent stake, and the rest is held by financial institutions.

**Factors Inhibiting the Growth of this Market** Inspite of the recent surge in securitization, the size of the market of this instrument is quite small. There have been many constraints in the pace of growth of this product.

- Lack of liquidity in the secondary market. The secondary market, which provides an exit route to investors, is non-existent.
- Lack of clarity on a number of legal issues relating to issuers. For instance, there is no clarity on reporting requirements, securitization accounting, and process.
- Lack of regulatory framework for SPVs.
- A narrow investor base confined to mutual funds, private banks and foreign banks.
- Lack of awareness and participation from public sector banks.
- Most of the securitized paper is sold on a private placement basis, thereby, limiting its growth potential.
- Certain provisions of the income tax law inhibit the process.
- Even after the introduction of the ordinance on Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest, it is not clear to which authority the originator should report before the launch of the issue.
- At present, there are no laws governing the recognition of the income of various entities engaged in the securitization deals.
- The securitization process becomes expensive because of the stamp duty. This stamp duty varies across states. Stamp duty structures on industrial loans across states is a major impediment for the securitization of these loans. Public sector banks' portfolio is dominated more by industrial loans as opposed to retail loans.
- The Securities Contract Regulation Act (SCRA) does not include securitized debt in the definition of 'securities' nor does it recognize special purpose vehicles, which issue securitized debt known as pass through certificates. This impedes the listing and trading of securitized paper. Listing of securitized paper improves transparency and leads to better price discovery.

For securitization to grow at a rapid pace, there is a need to increase the investor base by persuading public sector banks, provident funds, trusts, and foreign institutional investors to invest in this market, develop standard procedures and accounting standards, introduce changes in tax laws, and develop an active secondary market. The dealings in securitized instruments need to be transparent. A formal regulatory framework for securitization is needed. The RBI has set up a working group to suggest modalities for widening the investor base, improving the quality of assets, creating liquidity for trading in such assets, and related issues.

• The Securities Contract Regulation ACT (SCRA) does not include securitized debt in the definition of 'securities' nor does it recognize special purpose vehicles which issue securitized debt known as pass through certificates. This impedes the listing and trading of securitized paper.

The Reserve Bank issued draft guidelines on assets securitization in February 2006, to protect interests of investors in securitized debt. The regulations provide for a liquidity facility, which helps borrowers to tide over temporary cash shortages and may result due to timing differences faced by special purpose vehicles, between the receipt of cash flows from the underlying assets and the payments to be made to investors.

According to the guidelines:

- Liquidity facility should be drawn only where there is a sufficient level of non-default assets to cover the drawings.
- Liquidity facility to meet temporary mismatches in receivables should not be drawn for the purposes of providing credit enhancement, covering losses of SPVs, serving as a permanent revolving funding and covering any losses incurred in the underlying pool of exposures.
- Liquidity facility should not be available for meeting recurring expenses of securitization, funding acquisition of additional assets by SPV, funding the final scheduled repayment of investors and funding breach of warranties.
- Securities–issued SPVs would be in the nature of non-SLR securities. The counter party for investors will not be SPV, but the underlying assets, of which, the cash flow, are expected from the borrowers. Therefore, such investments will be included to reckon overall exposures to any individual or group borrower, industry or geographic area wherever the obligators in the pool constitute 5 per cent or more of the receivables or  $\overline{5}$  crore, whichever is lower.
- The profits from securitization should be amortized over the life of the securitized asset. Hence, banks will not be able to use securitization to show good results in a bad year.
- Banks have to bring in the required capital for the credit enhancement facility provided by the originator. Credit enhancement is the support provided, including through cash collaterals, to enhance the credit rating of the securitized assets.

## **Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO)**

Collateralized debt obligation is securitization of corporate obligations such as corporate loans, corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities. Collectively, CDO consists of collateralized bond obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and credit linked notes that emanate from the same financial family. Banks and financial institutions use this instrument to meet regulatory obligations and to increase their revenues. Under the Basel Accord formulated in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking and Supervision, banks in most of the developed countries are required to maintain a risk-based capital of 8 per cent of the outstanding balance of commercial loans. These high risk-based capital requirements make the holding of commercial loans unattractive as the margins on these loans are also low. By securitizing loan portfolios, banks are not only in a position to trim their balance sheets but they are able to generate funds from these portfolios.

The structure of a CDO consists of multiple layers called tranches which are formed by pooling underlying assets. Each tranch will have a pool of assets from corporate loans and bonds of similar seniority and maturity. These tranches are then rated by a credit rating agency and marketed.

These instruments offer higher yield to investors but the risk of default is high. Off-balance sheet financing has earned disrepute globally after the Enron fiasco. Many CDOs had Enron credit as part of their underlying exposure and these were defaults. This instrument is being increasingly used by European banks and the Bank of Japan besides American banks.

The ICICI Bank's first CDO issue failed to takeoff in March 2002 and was recalled because of unfavourable market conditions and lack of regulatory guidelines. In February 2004, the bank altered the product structure by bringing down the average maturity of the issue to around two years. The  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore CDO issue was mopped up by institutional investors. The ICICI bank sold corporate loans, given to 15 borrowers of varying sizes across 11 industries, through this issue to raise new assets as well as enhance exposure management in terms of specific sectors.

CDOs are new in the Indian market and new products take time to gain market acceptance. However, with an increase in investor awareness and setting up of a regulatory framework, this instrument will be preferred by Indian banks and financial institutions in times to come.

#### **Inverse Float Bonds**

These bonds are the latest entrants in the Indian capital market. Inverse float bonds are bonds carrying a floating rate of interest that is inversely related to short-term interest rates. The floating rate could be the

• Collateralized debt obligation is securitization of corporate obligations such as corporate loans, bonds, and asset-backed securities.
Mibor (Mumbai inter-bank offer rate) or some other rate. If the Mibor falls, the return for the investor rises and vice versa. The actual rate payable on these bonds is arrived at by subtracting the floating rate from a fixed benchmark rate. Suppose the fixed benchmark rate is 12 per cent and the six-month Mibor is 6 per cent, then the interest rate payable on these bonds is 6 per cent (12–6).

These bonds enable investors to earn high returns in a low interest rate environment. As interest rates are highly volatile, the investor has to observe the interest rate behaviour carefully over the entire bond period, else he could end up getting a poor return. Thus, both the investor and the issuer have to hedge the interest rate risk. If the interest rates go up, the issuer benefits as the coupon rate of his bonds will decline inspite of higher interest rates.

Inverse float bonds were introduced in the US market in 1990. In India, the Aditya Birla Group, Grasim, and Hindalco issued inverse float bonds in August 2002. The Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Limited (CIFCL) were the first non-banking finance company to raise funds through the issue of inverse floaters.

## **Perpetual Bonds**

They are debt instruments which do not have a maturity date. The investors receive a stream of interest payments for perpetuity. The bonds can be issued to retail investors with market making to ensure liquidity. The oldest perpetual bonds that continue to be in existence are those issued by the British Government in 1814 to fund the Napoleonic wars.

In case of liquidation, holders of perpetual bonds are paid second last, after all other depositors and creditors but before equity shareholders. Being permanent in nature, they qualify as Tier I capital (*i.e.*, equity and free reserves) of banks.

Another hybrid instrument similar to perpetual bonds is perpetual preference shares.

## **Municipal Bonds**

They are debt securities issued by the municipal corporation of a city to raise funds for financing their growing investment needs for a host of infrastructure projects. The Indian municipalities need a sum of  $\overline{28,500}$  crore to finance a number of basic projects. The financial health of municipalities is in a poor state. Till now, only the large municipalities were able to tap the market through issuance of such municipal bonds. Large municipalities issued bonds worth ₹1,500 crores. These bonds had limited appeal because the annual cumulative ceiling on municipal bond issues was a measly  $\overline{5150}$ –200 crore and the tax-free status was available only for select issues. At times, these bonds were made saleable through government guarantee.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation was the first urban local body to raise funds through municipal bonds. It was the first urban local body to receive a general obligation rating for its municipal bonds in February 1996 and raise funds through municipal bonds without a state government guarantee. The Bangalore Mahanagar Pallike (BMP) was the first to issue municipal bonds for  $\bar{\tau}$ 125 crore, with sevenyear maturity and a coupon of 13 per cent per annum in December 1997.

Under the new proposal approved by the Central Government in June 2006, the bonds would have a coupon rate of interest of 8 per cent and be tax-free. All urban local bodies in a state will form a State Pooled Finance Entity (SPFE) which will enter the bond market on a regular basis. In turn, the SPFE will provide a secure flow of debt to the projects proposed by the municipalities. This will hedge risks against longer spectrum of activities than an individual urban legal body (ULB). The municipal bonds to be issued by the SPFE will be rated by a credit rating agency so as to improve its marketability. To ensure that there is absolutely no default risk, the funds raised by the SPFE will be invested in triple A rated papers only, till they are deployed in projects. The centre will also deploy a sum of  $\overline{*}400$  crore as seed capital to finance the SPFEs. This will limit the extent of the financial exposure of the centre to these bonds.

The Indian municipal bond market constitutes a mere 0.1 per cent of the total corporate bonds traded in India in contrast to the US municipal bond market which accounts for about 12 per cent of the total corporate bond market. The preference of Indian investors, including insurance companies and banks, to invest in securities with shorter maturity, regulatory restrictions on investment allocation, and a fewer number of tax-free bonds acts as constraints on the development of this market.

Globally, municipal bonds constitute a huge market. In the US, investors hold about \$1.7 trillion worth of municipal bonds. The investors of these long tenure and tax-free bonds are households and mutual funds. The daily trading in these bonds is about \$11 billion.

SEBI issued a framework (Regulations) for public issue of debt securities by municipalities, and listing and trading of such securities in July, 2015.

• Inverse float bonds carry a floating rate of interest that is inversely related to short-term interest rates.

- Perpetual bonds are bonds with no maturity date and carry interest payments for perpetuity.
- Municipal bonds are issued by municipal corporations to finance infrastructure projects.
