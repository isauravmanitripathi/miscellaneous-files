# **Introduction**

In the post-reforms era, with increased activity in the Indian financial sector both existing and new companies are opting for finance from the capital market. The competition among firms for a slice of the savings cake has increased. New instruments have been designed by companies to attract investors to subscribe to their issues. The market is flooded with a variety of new and complex financial products, such as asset-backed securities and credit derivatives. These new instruments are embodied with complex features very difficult for an ordinary investor to understand and analyse. Besides this, investors no longer evaluate the creditworthiness of the borrowers by their names or size. Credit rating agencies have come into existence to assist the investors in their investment decisions, by assessing the creditworthiness of the borrowers.

Credit rating is the assessment of a borrower's credit quality. Credit rating performs the function of credit risk evaluation reflecting the borrower's expected capability to repay the debt as per terms of issue. Credit rating is merely an indicator of the current opinion of the relative capacity of a borrowing entity to service its debt obligations within a specified time period and with particular reference to the debt instrument being rated. Credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, hold or sell. It is a well-informed opinion made available to the public, and might influence their investment decisions. Credit rating, however, is not a general purpose evaluation nor overall assessment of credit risk of a firm. Ratings neither evaluate the reasonableness of the issue price or possibilities for capital gains nor take into account the liquidity in the secondary market. Ratings also do not take into account the risk of prepayment by issuer. Although these are often related to the credit risk, the rating essentially is an opinion on the relative quality of the credit risk. An agency that performs the rating of debt instruments is known as credit rating agency. At present, the scope of a credit rating agency is not limited to rating of debts. Credit rating agencies now undertake financial analysis and assessment of financial products, individuals, institutions, and governments.

# **The Importance of Credit Rating**

Credit rating helps in the development of financial markets. Credit rating agencies play a key role in the infrastructure of the modern financial system.

Credit rating enables investors to draw up the credit–risk profile and assess the adequacy or otherwise of the risk–premium offered by the market. It saves the investors, time and enables them to take a quick decision and provides them better choices among available investment opportunities based on their risk-return preferences. Issuers have a wider access to capital along with better pricing. Issuers with a high credit rating can raise funds at a cheaper rate thereby lowering their cost of capital. It acts as a marketing tool for the instrument, enhances the company's reputation and recognition, and enables even lesser known companies to raise funds from the capital market.

Credit rating is a tool in the hands of financial intermediaries, such as banks and financial institutions that can be effectively employed for taking decisions relating to lending and investments.

Credit rating helps the market regulators in promoting stability and efficiency in the securities market. Ratings make markets more efficient and transparent. They play a tremendous role in the growth of financial markets. It also helps in prescribing the requisite eligibility criteria for existing as well as new debt instruments, and monitoring the financial soundness of organizations. Ratings and rating changes influence the pricing of financial instruments.

Ratings help lenders, borrowers, issuers, investors, regulators and intermediaries make sound decisions. Ratings help corporates and investors manage and mitigate risks, take pricing and valuation decisions, reduce time to market, generate more revenue and enhance returns.

Rating agencies also help shape public policy on infrastructure in emerging markets, and thereby help catalyse economic growth and development in these geographies.

Ratings have assumed a much larger role in the global financial markets. Sovereign ratings affect the quantum of financial and investment flows to a country. Fund managers, international banks, and foreign direct investors look at ratings for portfolio allocation as ratings reflect the overall health of the country's economy.

# **Origin of the Concept of Credit Rating**

This concept originated in the US in 1909 AD when the founder of Moody's Investor Service, John Moody, rated the US Rail Road Bonds. However, the relevance of this concept was realized only after the great depression when investors lost all their money. Lack of symmetric information and high costs of collecting information increased the popularity of credit rating agencies. The world's biggest rating agencies are Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's (S&P). They have been into the rating business for decades. Both Moody's and S&P have been rating bonds since 1916 and have captured the lion's share. The nearest competitor of Moody's and S&P is Fitch Investors Service, which does not even share one-fifth of the business. These three rating agencies are given official recognition by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These agencies have grown so powerful that even sovereign governments are wary of getting a poor rating from them. Journalist Thomas Friedman once said, 'There are two superpowers in the world today. There is the United States and there is Moody's Bond Rating Service. The US can destroy by dropping bombs and Moody's can destroy you by downgrading your bonds.'

Initially, rating agencies in the US rated instruments and published their ratings free of charge. They financed their operations through sale of publications and related materials. But with an increase in the popularity of ratings, they began to charge issuers for ratings. US rating agencies offer both solicited and unsolicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings are made explicit with an asterisk. The rating agency is not compensated by the firm and rating is based on published information in case of unsolicited rating.

The rating giants have diversified their service portfolio in order to survive and grow. Besides rating bond issues—their core rating business—they have diversified into rating asset-backed securities, commercial papers, bank loans, and other financial products. These agencies also rate mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, and sovereign governments. There are specialized agencies in the US that rate only financial institutions or insurance companies. Their latest move has been in the field of risk consulting. Sovereign ratings are a new line of business for credit rating agencies. The first industrial country to be rated was France by Standard and Poor's in 1959. Both Moody's and S&P rated a non-industrial country, namely, Venezuela in October 1977. Fitch entered the business of sovereign rating only in 1975. India has been assigned sovereign ratings by Moody's and S&P over a decade. India is also being rated by Fitch, Japan Credit Rating Agency and Japan Bond Research Institute. Moody's started rating India in 1988 with an investment grade rating and S&P started rating India in August 1990. Both these agencies downgraded India's long-term sovereign credit rating to noninvestment grade during the external crisis of 1991. Recently both these agencies affirmed their positive outlook on India. They are yet to increase India's rating to investment grade.

India was first among the developing world to set up a credit rating agency—Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL) in 1988. Then came ICRA in 1990, followed by CARE in 1993. The credit rating function was further institutionalized in the 1990s when the Reserve Bank and the SEBI made credit rating mandatory for the issue of commercial paper (CP) and certain categories of debentures and debt instruments. For any public issue of corporate debts, credit rating has to be obtained from at least one credit rating agency with the Sebi's approval and is disclosed in the offer document. In case where ratings are obtained from more than one agency, all such ratings, including the unaccepted ones, would have to be disclosed in the offer documents. Every rating would be reviewed by registered credit rating agency and revision would have to be disclosed to stock exchange. The issuer can also list debt securities on private placement basis, provided they have been credit rated and meet other regulations. Issuer would have to redeem debt securities in terms of offer documents.

• The issuer-pays model has been in vogue across the world.

# **THE GROWTH OF THE CREDIT RATING INDUSTRY IN INDIA**

The prominent rating agencies in India are:

- CRISIL Limited
- ICRA Limited
- CARE Ratings
- India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd. (formerly Fitch Ratings India Pvt. Ltd.)
- Brickwork Ratings India Pvt. Ltd.
- SMERA Ratings Limited
- Infomerics Valuation and Rating Pvt. Ltd.

The Indian credit rating industry is next to the US in terms of number of ratings issued and in the number of agencies. CRISIL is the market leader in the credit rating industry with a 70 per cent market share.

The regulator's support played an important role in the development of the credit rating industry. In 1992, for the first time, the Reserve Bank introduced the requirement of rating for commercial paper. The SEBI followed up by introducing mandatory rating of bonds. The other growth drivers of the credit rating industry were declining interest rates, a shift towards market borrowings from bank loans and a steep increase in the state government borrowings through special purpose vehicles. Besides these factors the growth in the private placement market of debt increased business volume in the credit rating industry. For private placements, rating is not mandatory but banks and mutual funds ask for a rating. In 1997, the penetration of rating, that is, the number of rated issues out of the total number of issues was 35 per cent. In the year 2002, it was 97 per cent. This means that the credit rating industry has transited from a regulatory-driven market to an investor-driven market in the growing debt markets. Between fiscal 1997 and 2001, rated debt volumes increased from  $\bar{\tau}$ 13,743 crore to  $\bar{\tau}$ 52,746 crore, which is 84 per cent of the total issuance.

## **Rating Methodology**

In India, the rating exercise starts at the request of the company. The process of obtaining a rating is quite lengthy and time consuming.

The rating of a financial instrument requires a thorough analysis of relevant factors that affect the creditworthiness of the issuer. The primary focus of the rating exercise is to assess future cash generation capability and their adequacy to meet debt obligations in adverse conditions. The analysis attempts to determine the long-term fundamentals and the probabilities of change in these fundamentals, which could affect the credit-worthiness of the borrower. Analysis typically involves at least five years of operating history and financial data as well as company and rating agency forecasts of future performance. Ratings are assigned after an in-depth study of both objective and subjective factors related to business, financial management and so on. Ratings are based on an indepth study of the industry and an evaluation of the strengths and weakness of the company. The analytical framework for rating consists of the following five broad areas:

**1. Economy analysis** The Economic environment is assessed to determine the degree of operating risk faced by the company in a given business. Here the economy wide factors which have a bearing on the industry are taken into consideration. The strategic nature of the industry in the prevailing policy environment, regulatory oversight governing industries, etc. are also analysed.

**2. Business Analysis** This covers an analysis of industry risk, market position in the country, operating efficiency of the company, and legal position.

- An analysis of industry risk focuses on the prospects of the industry and the competitive factors affecting the industry. Investment plans of the major players in the industry, demand supply factors, price trends, changes in technology, international/domestic competitive factors in the industry, entry barriers, capital intensity, business cycles, etc. are key ingredients of industry risk. Industry risk covers an analysis of actual and estimated demand/supply, number of firms and potential entrants in the industry, government policies relating to the industry, the performance of the industry, its future potentiality, and other factors.
- Market position in the industry covers the study of market share of the firms (marketing strengths and weaknesses of the firm vis-a-vis its competitors), marketing arrangements, products, and customers.

#### **Rating Methodology**

- Economy Analysis
- Business Analysis
- Financial Analysis
- Management Evaluation
- Fundamental Analysis

- Operating efficiency is a study of production processes of the firm, its cost structure, locational advantages, labour relationships, input availability, and prices.
- Legal position covers a study of prospectus, accuracy of information, and filing of forms, returns, and so on with proper regulatory authorities.

**3. Financial Analysis** It involves evaluation of past and expected future financial performance with emphasis on assessment of adequacy of cash flows towards debt servicing. Financial analysis includes an analysis of accounting quality, earnings protection, cash flow adequacy, and financial flexibility.

- Accounting quality is known by the study of method of income recognition, inventory valuation, depreciation policies, auditor's remarks, and off-balance liabilities accounts are noted. A review of accounting quality and adherence to prudential accounting norms are examined for measuring the company's performance. Prudent disclosures of material events affecting the company are reviewed. Impact of the auditor's qualifications and comments are quantified and analytical adjustments are made to the accounts, if they are material. Off-balance sheet items are factored into the financial analysis and adjustments made to the accounts, wherever necessary. Change of accounting policy in a particular year which results in improved reported performance is also analyzed.
- Earnings protection is examined with reference to profitability ratios, earnings growth, and projected earnings, among others. Financial ratios are used to make a holistic assessment of financial performance of the company, as also to see the company's performance—intra-firm and inter-firm within the industry.
- Adequacy of cash flows includes a study of future cash flows, working capital needs, and capital budgets. Cash flow analysis forms an important part of credit rating decisions. Availability of internally generated cash for servicing debt is the most comforting factor for rating decisions as compared to dependence on external sources of cash to cover temporary shortfalls.
- Financial flexibility is examined in terms of whether alternative sources of liquidity are available to the company as and when required. It also examines whether financing plans have been developed and the feasibility of such plans. Company's contingency plans under various stress scenarios are considered and examined. Ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds whenever a company faces financial crunch is reviewed. Existence of liquid investments, access to lines of credits from strong group concerns to tide over stress situations, ability to sell assets quickly, defer capital expenditure, etc. are also considered.
- Validation of projections and sensitivity analysis: The projected performance of the company over the life of the instrument is critically examined and assumptions underlying the projections are validated. The critical parameters affecting the industry and the anticipated performance of the industry are identified.

In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed through several 'what if' scenarios to assess a company's capacity to cope with changes in its operating environment. A scenario analysis is undertaken wherein each critical parameter is then stress tested to arrive at the performance of the company in a stress situation. Debt service coverage for each of the scenarios would indicate the capability of the company to service its debt, under each scenario.

**4. Management Evaluation** This includes a study of the track record of the management, the management's capacity to overcome adverse situations, goals, philosophy, strategies, control systems, personnel policies, and performance of group companies. An assessment of the management's plan in comparison to those of its competitors can provide important insights into the company's ability to sustain its business.

**5. Fundamental Analysis** This covers an analysis of liquidity management, asset quality, profitability and interest, and tax sensitivity.

- Liquidity management can be known through a study of capital structure, matching of assets and liabilities, liquid assets, maturing deposits, among others.
- Asset quality includes the company's credit management, policies for monitoring credit, composition of assets, and sector risk.
- Profitability is examined through a study of profitability ratios, spreads, reserves, and non-business income.
- Interest and tax sensitivity is in terms of exposure to interest rate charges, hedge against interest rate, tax provisions, and impact of tax law changes.

The above information is collected and then analysed by a team of professionals in an agency. Companies are asked to fill up the forms and provide the required data. If necessary, meetings with top management suppliers, and dealers, and a visit to the plant or proposed sites are arranged to collect and confirm additional data and issues relating to credit evaluation of a firm. This team of professionals/analysts submits their recommendations to the rating committee. The committee discusses this report and then assigns rating. Once the quantitative data is analysed, it is the seasoned judgement of the rating committee, which makes rating of an agency unique and sometimes controversial. Rating involves a lot of subjectivity in the process; for instance, in case of bond ratings, besides a quantitative analysis of past performance, it is the future debt servicing capacity of a company that is relevant. An analysis of the estimate of this capacity is subjective and subjectivity cannot be ruled out.

The rating assigned is then notified to the issuer and only on his acceptance, the rating is published. A rating agency assures strict confidentiality of information to its client. If the client wants to furnish additional information, he can do so and gets the rating reviewed again. Once the issuer decides to use and publish the rating, the agency has to continuously monitor it over the entire life of the instrument. The rating agency continuously monitors the corporate, and rating is monitored till the life of the instrument. This process is known as surveillance.

Rating may be upgraded, downgraded, or continue unchanged, depending upon new information or developments and their resultant effect on the debt instrument being rated. The revised ratings are also published and made public in financial dailies and newspapers.

## **Rating Symbols**

Rating agencies use symbols such as AAA, AA, BBB, B, C, D, to convey the safety grade to the investor. Ratings are classified into three grades: high investment grades, investment grades and speculative grades. In all, risk is classified into 14 or 15 categories. Signs '+' or '−' are used to show the certainty of timely payment. The suffix + or − may be used to indicate the comparative position of the instrument within the group covered by the symbol. Thus FAA-lies one notch above FA+. To provide finer gradations, rating agencies attach plus or minus symbols to their ratings. The racing symbols for different instruments of the same company need not necessarily be the same.

#### **High Investment Grades**

- AAA: Triple A denotes highest safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. The issuer is fundamentally strong and any adverse changes are not going to affect it.
  - AA: Double A denotes high safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. The issuer differs in safety from AAA issue only marginally.
  - A: denotes adequate safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. Changes in circumstances can adversely affect such issues.
- BBB: Triple B denotes moderate safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal speculative grades.

#### **Speculative Grades**

- BB: Double B denotes inadequate safety terms of timely payment of interest and principal. Uncertain changes can lead to inadequate financial capacity to make timely payments in the immediate future.
- B: Denotes high risk. Adverse changes could lead to inability or unwillingness to make timely payment.
- C: Denotes substantial risk. Issue rated is vulnerable to default.
- D: Denotes default in terms of timely payment of interest and principal.

These symbols are just a current opinion of an agency and they are not recommendations to invest or not to invest. The rating assigned applies to a particular instrument of the company and is not a general evaluation of the company.

**Rating Fees** In the credit rating business, the users of rating services, such as investors, financial intermediaries and other end-users, do not pay for it. The issuer of the financial instrument pays fees to the credit rating agency and this is the major source of revenue of the rating agency. Today, issuer's fees constitute 95 per cent of the total revenues of rating agencies. In India, rating agencies charge 0.1 per cent of instrument size as rating fees. They also charge an annual surveillance fees at a rate of 0.03 per cent to monitor the instrument during its life.

# **IPO GRADING BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES**

The IPO scam of 2005 shook the confidence of retail investors in the capital market. Many retail investors were deprived of allotment of IP shares as a large number of shares were cornered through multiple share applications and opening of *benami* dematerialized accounts by few scamsters. In order to protect the interest of small investors, SEBI made amendments to the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000.

SEBI recommended a new service 'IPO Grading' that provides an independent assessment of fundamentals to aid comparative assessment that would prove useful as an information and imvestment tool for the investors. Moreover, such a service is particularly useful for assessing the offerings of companies accessing the equity markets for the first time where there is no track record of their market performance. Credit rating agencies registered with SEBI carry out IPO grading for any individual issue, which would represent a relative assessment of the fundamentals of that issue in relation to other listed equity shares. Such grading is assigned on a five-point scale with a higher score indicating stronger fundamentals. IPO grading is a one-time assessment done prior to the IPO issue during the draft prospectues stage. The grading is mandatory for the issuing company and the cost of grading IPOs would be borne by the issuer.

## **Limitations of Credit Rating in India**

The rating business in India grew tremendously in the 1990s. New rating agencies came into existence and competition among them increased. There has been a significant increase in volume of rated debt. The rating business is going strong because of mandatory rating of IPOs, roll out of Basel II norms, rating of security receipts of public–private partnership projects, increased market access by real estate companies, rating of urban municipal bonds, and RBI's stipulations that companies with borrowings of₹10 crore and above need to get rated. Despite the increase in popularity of rating, the credit rating business suffers from certain limitations.

- The credibility of rating is questionable. The institutions whose instruments were given the highest rating have not performed well. For example, CARE gave the highest rating to CRB Capital, which failed. The CRB scam created a panic among investors and credit agencies alike. While investors queued up to prematurely retire their deposits with NBFCs, rating agencies started downgrading almost every company irrespective of their status.
- A frequent revision of grading by credit rating agencies, that is, sometimes upgrading and sometimes downgrading, creates a confusion among investors questioning again the credibility of the expertise of rating agencies.
- Around a third of the ratings done by credit rating agencies are not accepted by the clients. This has led to a competitive relaxation of rating standards by credit rating agencies. It should be mandatory to obtain at least two ratings as risk perception of rating agencies differ. Both the ratings should be mandatory published in the prospectus, advertisements, and newspapers,
- The rating agencies do not perform an audit but rely solely on information provided by the issuer. If the information provided is inaccurate and incomplete, the rating process is compromized.

- Often a credit rating agency gives a high rating to one instrument of a particular company on the one hand and on the other, frequently downgrades the rating of another instrument of the same company. The rating exercise appears biased and investors not only get confused but lose their investments by depending on these ratings.
- Rating agencies often fail to correctly predict a borrower's financial health in the short-term. The latest case is the non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue of BPL which was downgraded by CRISIL from A to D in one stroke. In other words, CRISIL downgraded the instrument by 12 stages. The investor, who depends on these ratings, is not given any warning by rating agencies to wind down his investment in time.
- Rating agencies offer consultancy and financial advice to the clients whose papers they rate. This leads to a conflict of interest and compromise on their rating process to favour their clients. This has been highlighted by the financial crisis in the US. Hence, the government is working with regulators on the new regulatory framework for credit rating agencies.

### **Conclusion**

Ratings are opinions on creditworthiness based on objective and subjective analysis. Rating agencies play an important role in the world markets; they can best serve markets when they operate independently, adopt and enforce internal guidelines to avoid conflicts of interest, and protect confidential information received from issuers. Credit rating agencies cannot afford to commit too many mistakes as it is the investor who pays the price for their mistakes. Credit rating agencies should be made accountable for any faulty rating by penalizing them or even de-recognizing them, if needed. Competition in the rating industry should be enhanced by creating niche rating agencies specializing in information technology, or state governments.
