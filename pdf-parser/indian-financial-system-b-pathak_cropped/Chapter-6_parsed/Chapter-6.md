# **Introduction**

The primary market is a market for new issues. It is also called the new issues market. It is a market for fresh capital. Funds are mobilized in the primary market through prospectus, rights issues, and private placement.

Bonus issue is also one of the ways to raise capital but it does not bring in any fresh capital. Some companies distribute profit to existing shareholders by the way of fully paid bonus shares instead of paying them a dividend. Bonus shares are issued in the ratio of the existing shares held. The shareholders do not have to pay for bonus shares but the retained earnings are converted into capital. Thus, bonus shares enable the company to restructure its capital.

Bonus is the capitalization of free reserves. Higher the free reserves, higher are the chances of a bonus issue forthcoming from a corporate. Bonus issues create excitement in the market as the shareholders do not have to pay for them and in addition, they add to their wealth. A bonus issue results in an increase in the company's equity capital. A 1:1 bonus doubles the company's equity base. A bonus issued by a company indicates management's confidence in strong earnings, growth and maintenance of its present level of dividend rate in the future. Companies issue bonus shares for varied reasons.

- To boost liquidity of their stock: A bonus issue results in expansion of equity base, increasing the number of absolute shares available for trading.
- To bring down the stock price: A high price often acts as a deterrent for a retail investor to buy a stock. The price of a stock falls on becoming ex-bonus because an investor buying shares, ex-bonus is not entitled to bonus shares. For instance, a scrip trading at  $\overline{$}600$  cum-bonus with a 1:1 bonus begins trading at around  $\overline{$}300$  ex-bonus.
- To restructure their capital, companies with high reserves prefer to issue bonus shares as the issue not only restructures their capital but since they are perceived to be likely candidates for bonus issue by investors, they fulfil the expectation of investors.

In India, new capital issues are floated through prospectus, rights, and private placement by government companies, non-government public limited companies (private sector), public sector undertakings, banks, and financial institutions.

Issues are offered to the public through prospectus and the public subscribes directly. The Companies Act 2013 provides that where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or debentures is made to 200 or more persons, then such an offer or invitation shall be deemed to be a public offering and shall have to comply with all the provisions of the act as well as the SEBI guidelines applicable to such public offerings. Public issuesare open to the general public. Wide publicity about the offer is given through the media. In the past, the job of organizing public issues was generally entrusted to prominent brokers but that practice has now given way to the appointment of a merchant banker for the purpose.

The direct sale of securities by a company to some select people or to institutional investors is called private placement. No prospectus is issued in private placement. Private placement covers equity shares, preference shares, and debentures. It offers access to capital more quickly than the public issue and is quite inexpensive on account of the absence of various issue related expenses.

There are three categories of participants in the primary market. They are the issuers of securities, investors in securities, and intermediaries. The last named render services to both the issuers and investors to enable the sale and purchase of securities.

#### **Intermediaries to an Issue**

There are different intermediaries to an issue such as merchant bankers or book running lead managers (BRLM), syndicate members, registrars to the issue, bankers to the issue, auditors of the company and solicitors. The issuer discloses the addresses, telephone, fax numbers and email addresses of these intermediaries.

**Merchant Banker** A merchant banker should be registered with the SEBI as per the SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992 to act as a book running lead manager (BRLM) to an issue. The lead merchant banker performs most of the pre-issue and post-issue activities. The pre-issue activities of the lead manager include due diligence of company's operations/management/business plans/legal, etc., drafting and designing offer document, finalizing the prospectus, drawing up marketing strategies for the issue, and ensuring compliance with stipulated requirements and completion of prescribed formalities with the stock exchanges and the Registrar of Companies (ROC).

The post-issue activities include management of escrow accounts, coordinating, non-institutional allocation, intimation of allocation, coordination with the registrar for dispatching of refunds, demateralizing of securities, listing and trading of securities, and coordinating the work of other intermediaries involved in the issue process.

**Registrar to the Issue** The role of the registrar is to finalize the list of eligible allottees, ensure crediting of shares to the demat accounts of the eligible allottees, and dispatch refund orders.

**Bankers to the Issue** They are appointed in all the mandatory collection centres, and by the lead merchant banker to carry out activities relating to collection of application amounts, transfer of this amount to escrow accounts, and dispatching refund amounts.

It is now mandatory to issue all new initial public offerings (IPOs) in dematerialized form as they are compulsorily traded in dematerialized form.

## **Free Pricing Regime**

Before 1992, the Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) used to regulate the new issues market under the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947. Companies had to obtain approval from the CCI for raising funds in the primary market. The timing, quantum, and pricing of the issue were decided by the controller. New companies could issue shares only at par, while the existing companies with substantial reserves could issue shares at a premium. This premium was based on a prescribed formula set by the CCI. The formula was based on balancing the two criteria, viz., the net assets value and price earnings value. The issue price was set far below the market price of the company's share. This fixed price mechanism resulted in underpricing of many issues.

In 1992, the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed and all controls relating to raising of resources from the market were removed. Hence, now the promoters (issuers of securities) do not require the consent of any authority either for making the issue or for pricing it. The promoter and his merchant banker together decide the price of the issue. Both new and established companies are free to decide the price of their issue.

There emerged under free pricing, an alliance of dishonest promoters and greedy merchant bankers. They brought out issues with rosy but unreal projections and sold shares at very high premiums. These projections never materialized, leading to a crash in prices. Moreover, companies with a negative bottom line came back with repeated rights issues at a premium. Issues of all kinds and premiums unheard of in corporate history were made in the early days of free pricing. These issues killed the primary market. Most of these issues were quoted below their offer price on the day they were listed at the stock exchange. Of the 4,000 issues that hit the market in 1992–96, more than 3,000 quoted below their offer price on the very day they were listed. For example, Saurashtra Cements hit the market in September 1993 at  $\bar{\tau}$ 250 per share. It stood at  $\bar{8}5$  when it was listed on the stock exchange; today it fetches only  $\bar{8}8$ . The free market became a free falling market in numerous cases.

• Book Running Lead Manager (BRLM) is a lead merchant banker appointed by the issuer company and whose name is mentioned in the offer document of the company.

The regulator brought in strict regulations for merchant bankers, brokers, and others, and laid down guidelines for full disclosures for investors' protection. Unfortunately, this was done only when the small investors had fled the market. Today promoters are required to justify the issue price in the prospectus and make material disclosures about the risk factors in the offer document.

## **Book Building—A New Issue Mechanism In India**

The mechanics of determining the offer price during the CCI regime was to offer the share at a fixed price. Here, the firm and the merchant banker decided an offer price without taking into account the investor's feedback. Fixed price offerings were made to uninformed investors. Moreover, there was a long time lag from the date of pricing to the date the issue opened, and to the date trading commenced. This raised the possibility of price fluctuations in the intervening period. Empirical evidence supports the view that fixed price offering results in high cost of capital for firms due to under-pricing of shares for attracting subscription.

The pricing pattern changed in the free pricing era. This era was characterized by unrealistic and abrupt pricing structure, which stripped the radiance of the capital market. Investors shied away from the market after burning their fingers in those premium issues that are now being quoted not only below their issue price but even below their par value.

Following the inefficient functioning of the capital market system, an alternative method, called the book building method, is slowly becoming popular in India. Book building is a mechanism through which an offer price for IPOs based on the investors' demand is determined. In the fixed price method, the investors' demand is not taken into account; the book building method explicitly uses investors' demand for shares at various prices as an important input to arrive at an offer price.

Globally, book building is a recognized mechanism for capital raising. It was book building which built the US market almost entirely in the 1940s and 1950s.

The SEBI guidelines define book building as a process undertaken by which a demand for the securities proposed to be issued by a corporate body is elicited and built-up and the price for such securities is assessed for the determination of the quantum of such securities to be issued by means of a notice, circular, advertisement, document or information, memoranda or offer document.

The book building is basically an auction of shares. Book building essentially means that the 'book is being built.' During the process on both the NSE and the BSE, investors can watch the book being built– a chart shown indicates the bid price and the number of shares being bid for. This helps the investor to know the market price. It offers investors the opportunity to bid collectively. It then uses the bids to arrive at a consensus price.

The issue of securities through book building prior to August 2009 could be done in either of the following two ways: 75 per cent book building known as partial book building and 100 per cent known as one-stage book building. The SEBI allowed partial book building with only 75 per cent of the total issue allotted for the book built portion; the remaining 25 per cent has to be compulsorily offloaded in the general market at a fixed price discovered during the book building process. The IPOs of Hughes Software and HCL Technologies are examples of partial book building which were successful. A 100 per cent book building issue implies that the entire issue is completed in a single stage, without having to make a mandatory fixed price offering. The option of 100 per cent book building was available only to those issuer companies which are to make an issue of capital of and above  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore. Due to these restrictive guidelines, no issue was floated using this mechanism. These guidelines were modified in 1998–99. The ceiling of issue size for book building was reduced from  $\overline{100}$  crore to  $\overline{25}$  crore. Bharti Televentures **Methods for Determining the Offer Price**

Difference Between Shares Offered Through Book Building and Offer of Shares Through Normal Public Issues

*Source:* BSE.

was the first 100 per cent book building issue. It raised  $\overline{834}$  crore through 100 per cent book building in 2001–02. The 100 per cent book building route speeds up the public offering and allotment processes as they take place entirely through the stock exchange network. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange(BSE) provide a real time graphic display of price and volumes of applications made towards a book building issue through the stock exchange network. This system aids in better price discovery and transparency as institutional investors have the necessary expertise to analyse the information. The 100 per cent book building route provides the option to defer or scrap the issue if the discovered price is inappropriate. Because most issuers preferred 100 per cent book building, the SEBI withdrew the 75 per cent book building option.

#### **The Book Building Process**

- The company (issuer) first of all appoints one or more merchant banker(s) as book runner(s) and their name(s) shall be disclosed in the draft red herring prospectus. The lead merchant banker shall act as the lead book runner and shall be primarily responsible for the book building. There shall be only one lead book runner and if the issuer appoints more than one, they shall either be co-book runners or syndicate members.
- The lead book runner and co-book runners shall compulsorily underwrite the issue and the syndicate members shall sub-underwrite with the lead book runner/co-book runners. A 'syndicate member' means an intermediary registered with the SEBI and who is permitted to carry on the activity as an underwriter;

The details of final underwriting arrangement indicating actual numbers of shares underwritten shall be disclosed and printed in the prospectus before it is registered with the Registrar of Companies.

- The issuer shall enter into an agreement with one or more of the stock exchange(s) which have the system of on-line offer of securities. The agreement shall specify inter-alia, the rights, duties, responsibilities, and obligations of the issuer and recognized stock exchange(s) inter se.
- The book runner(s)/syndicate members shall appoint stock brokers who are members of the recognized stock exchange and registered with the SEBI, for the purpose of accepting bids, applications and placing orders with the issuer and ensure that the stock brokers so appointed are financially capable of honouring their commitments arising out of defaults of their clients/ investors, if any. In case of Application Supported by Blocked Amount, Self-certified Syndicate Banks shall also accept and upload the details of such applications in electronic bidding system of the stock exchange(s). A 'Self-certified Syndicate Bank' means a banker to an issue registered with the SEBI, which offers the facility of Application Supported by Blocked Amount. The stock brokers and Self-certified Syndicate Bank accepting applications and application monies shall be deemed as 'bidding/collection centres.'

The underwriters also collect information from potential buyers and attempts to build interest. Part of the process of collecting this information is a road show, so named because the underwriter goes from city to city making presentations about the company and the offering. The road show is conducted in the form of a press release, a broker–analyst meet and investor meet.

- The lead merchant banker shall file with the SEBI a draft red herring prospectus containing all the disclosures including total issue size, if applicable, except the price and the number of specified securities to be offered.
- Book building was first introduced in 1999 with the concept of a price band. Price band includes the floor price and the cap price. For instance, the PNB issue's price band was  $\overline{3}50-390$ .  $\overline{3}50$  is the floor price–the minimum bid—and  $\overline{\tau}390$  is the cap price. Investors can bid at any price between  $\overline{\tau}350$ and `390. However, in April 2000, the SEBI moved to the concept of a fixed floor price, which led to underpricing as maximum bids were received at or just above the floor price. The SEBI reintroduced the moving price band concept in book built IPOs. In a moving price band, the range can be moved, upwards or downwards, depending on the demand and the direction in which the book is being built. The band can be moved by 20 per cent (earlier 50 per cent) either way.
- The issuer may mention the floor price or price band in the red herring prospectus.
  - a. If the issuer opts not to make the disclosure of the price band or floor price in the red herring prospectus, the following shall also be disclosed in the red herring prospectus:
    - i. a statement that the floor price or price band, as the case may be, shall be disclosed at least two working days (in case of an initial public offer) and at least one working day (in case of a further public offer) before the opening of the bid;

• Book building is a process by which demand for the proposed issue is elicited and built-up and the price at which the securities will be issued is determined on the basis of the bids received.

• Book Running Lead Manager (BRLM) is a lead merchant banker appointed by the issuer company and whose name is mentioned in the offer document of the company. A BRLM which is also an associate of the issuer shall have the restricted role of marketing the issue and accordingly declare itself as a 'Marketing Lead Manager' in the offer document. All the BRLMs to the issue will sign the due diligence certificate.

• Red Herring Prospectus is a prospectus which does not have details of either price or number of shares being offered or the amount of issue

- ii. a statement that the investors may be guided in the meantime by the secondary market prices (in case of a further public offer); and
- iii. the names and editions of the newspapers where the announcement of the floor price or price band would be made; names of websites (with address), journals, or other media in which the said announcement will be made.
- b. Where the issuer decides to opts for price band instead of floor price, the issuer shall also ensure compliance with the following conditions:
  - i. The spread between the floor and the cap of the price band should not be more than 20 per cent. In other words, the cap should not be more than 120 per cent of the floor price. This price band denotes the range of bidding.
  - ii. The price band can be revised during the bidding period in which case the maximum revision on either side shall not exceed 20 per cent, *i.e.*, floor of price band can move up or down to the extent of 20 per cent of floor of the price band disclosed in the red herring prospectus and the cap of the revised price band will be fixed in accordance with clause (i) above.
  - iii. Any revision in the price band shall be widely disseminated by informing the stock exchanges, by issuing press release, and also by indicating the change on the relevant website and the terminals of the syndicate members.
  - iv. In case the price band is revised, the bidding period shall be extended to a maximum of ten working days.
  - v. The m anner in which the shortfall, if any, in the project financing, arising on account of lowering of price band to the extent of 20 per cent will be met shall be disclosed in the red herring prospectus. It shall also be disclosed that the allotment shall not be made unless the financing is tied up.
- The basis for issue price, floor price, or price band, as the case may be, shall be disclosed and justified by the issuer in consultation with the lead merchant banker on the basis of the following information, which shall be also disclosed separately:
  - a. Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share, pre-issue, for the last three years (as adjusted for changes in capital).
  - b. Price earning ratio pre-issue.
  - c. Average return on net worth in the last three years.
  - d. Minimum return on increased net worth required to maintain pre-issue earnings per share.
  - e. Net asset value per share based on last balance sheet.
  - f. Net asset value per share after issue and comparison thereof with the issue price.

Comparison of all the accounting ratios of the issuer as mentioned in items (a) to (f) above with the industry average and with the accounting ratios of the peer group (*i.e.*, companies of comparable size in the same industry and the source from which industry average and accounting ratios of the peer group has been taken shall be indicated).

The face value of equity shares and the statement that the issue price, floor price, or price band, as the case may be, is 'X' times of the face value. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, the Act and these regulations, an issuer making an initial public offer may determine the face value of the equity shares in the following manner:

- 1. If the issue price per equity share is  $\overline{500}$  or more, the issuer shall have the option to determine the face value at less than  $\overline{z}10$  per equity share provided that the face value shall not be less than one rupee per equity share.
- 2. If the issue price per equity share is less than  $\text{\textless}500$ , the face value of the equity shares shall be  $\overline{\tau}10$  equity share.

Provided that nothing contained in this sub-regulation shall apply to initial public offer made by any government company, statutory authority or corporation or any special purpose vehicle set up by any of them, which is engaged in infrastructure sector.

In case the option of differential pricing under Regulation 29 has been availed, justification for the price difference shall be given in the offer document. An issuer may offer specified securities at different prices, subject to the following:

1. Retail individual investors or retail individual shareholders may be offered specified securities at a price lower than the price at which net offer is made to other categories of applicants provided that such difference shall not be more than 10 per cent of the price at which specified securities are offered to other categories of applicants.

- 2. In case of a book built issue, the price of the specified securities offered to an anchor investor shall not be lower than the price offered to other applicants.
- 3. In case of a composite issue, the price of the specified securities offered in the public issue may be different from the price offered in rights issue and justification for such price difference shall be given in the offer document.

Whenever fully convertible debt instruments (FCDs) are issued bearing interest at a rate less than the bank rate, the offer document shall contain disclosures about the price that would work out to the investor, taking into account the notional interest loss on the investment from the date of allotment of FCDs to the date(s) of conversions.

- A public issue shall be kept open for at least three working days but not more than ten working days, including the days for which the issue is kept open in case of revision in price band. In case the price band in a public issue made through the book building process is revised, the bidding (issue) period disclosed in the red herring prospectus shall be extended for a minimum period of three working days provided that the total bidding period shall not exceed ten working days. In other words, a bid is usually open for three and not more than seven working days, which may be extended to a maximum of ten working days, in case the price band is revised.
- The issuer shall, after registering the red herring prospectus (in case of a book built issue) or prospectus (in case of fixed price issue) with the Registrar of Companies, make a pre-issue advertisement in one English national daily newspaper with wide circulation, Hindi national daily newspaper with wide circulation, and one regional language newspaper with wide circulation at the place where the registered office of the issuer is situated. The pre-issue advertisement shall include the following details: name and address of the registered office of the issuer and the lead book runner/merchant bankers, and details of the issue such as nature of the specified security, size of the issue, face value of the security, price band, the proportion of shares to be allotted to different categories of investors including anchor investor, proposed listing, disclaimer clause, time period of the opening and closing of the issue, IPO grading, and names of the bankers to the issue. The issue advertisements shall also disclose the financial ratios calculated for both upper and lower end of the price band.

#### **Bidding Process**

- 1. Bidding process shall be only through an electronically linked transparent bidding facility provided by recognized stock exchange(s).
- 2. The lead book runner shall ensure the availability of adequate infrastructure with syndicate members for data entry of the bids in a timely manner.
- 3. The syndicate members shall be present at the bidding centres so that at least one electronically linked computer terminal at all the bidding centres is available for the purpose of bidding.
- 4. During the period the issue is open to the public for bidding, the applicants may approach the stock brokers of the stock exchange/s through which the securities are offered under on-line system or Self Certified Syndicate Banks, as the case may be, to place an order for bidding for the specified securities.
- 5. Every stock broker shall accept orders from all clients/investors who place orders through him and every Self Certified Syndicate Bank shall accept Applications Supported by Blocked Amount from ASBA investors.
- 6. Applicants who are Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) shall place their bids only through the stock brokers who shall have the right to vet the bids.
- 7. The bidding terminals shall contain an on-line graphical display of demand and bid prices updated at periodic intervals, not exceeding 30 minutes.
- 8. At the end of each day of the bidding period, the demand including allocation made to anchor investors shall be shown graphically on the bidding terminals of syndicate members and websites of recognized stock exchanges offering electronically linked transparent bidding facility, for information of public.
- 9. The investors (except ASBA investors) may revise their bids.
- 10. The qualified institutional buyers shall not withdraw their bids after closure of bidding.
- 11. The identity of qualified institutional buyers making the bidding shall not be made public.
- 12. The stock exchanges shall continue to display on their website, the data pertaining to book built issues in an uniform format, inter alia giving category-wise details of bids received, for a period of atleast three days after closure of bids.

• The margin collected from categories other than qualified institutional buyers shall be uniform across the book runner(s)/syndicate members/Self-certified Syndicate Banks for each such investor category.

An amount of not less than 10 per cent of the application money in respect of bids placed by qualified institutional buyers and not less than 25 per cent of the application money from the Anchor investors was taken as margin money till April 30, 2010. In order to avoid inflated demand in public issues and provide level playing field to all investors subscribing for securities, all types of investors are required to bring in 100 per cent of the application money as margin money along with the application for securities in public issues.

## **Determination of Price**

- 1. The issuer shall, in consultation with lead book runner, determine the issue price based on the bids received.
- 2. On determination of the price, the number of specified securities to be offered shall be determined (*i.e.*, issue size divided by the price to be determined).
- 3. Once the final price (cut-off price) is determined, all those bidders whose bids have been found to be successful (*i.e.*, at and above the final price or cut-off price) shall be entitled for allotment of specified securities.
- 4. Retail individual investors may bid at 'cut off' price instead of their writing the specific bid price in the bid forms.
- 5. The lead book runner may reject a bid placed by a qualified institutional buyer for reasons to be recorded in writing provided that such rejection shall be made at the time of acceptance of the bid and the reasons therefore shall be disclosed to the bidders.

Necessary disclosures in this regard shall also be made in the red herring prospectus.

## **Registering of prospectus with Registrar of Companies**

The final prospectus containing all disclosures in accordance with the provisions of these regulations including the price and the number of specified securities proposed to be issued shall be registered with the Registrar of Companies.

# **Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) Process**

The SEBI launched an alternate payment system for book built public issues in August 2008. The alternate payment system, called additional mode of payment through ASBA, exempts retail investors from making full advance payment and instead let the amount to be retained in bank accounts till the completion of allotment. This system co-exists with the current process, wherein cheque is used as a mode of payment by retail investors. ASBA can be used only for retail investors and on an optional basis.

ASBA is an application for subscribing to an issue, containing an authorization to block the application money in a bank account. This system does away with the refund process and thereby reduces the time between an issue and its listing. ASBA Process is as follows:

- An ASBA investor shall submit an ASBA physically or electronically through the internet banking facility to the Self-certified Syndicate Bank (SCSB) with whom the bank account to be blocked is maintained. SCSB is a bank which offers the facility of applying through the ASBA process. ASBAs can be accepted only by SCSBs, whose names appear in the list of SCSBs displayed in SEBI's website.
- The SCSB shall then block the application money in the bank account specified in the ASBA, on the basis of an authorization to this effect given by the account holder in the ASBA. The application money shall remain blocked in the bank account till finalization of the basis of allotment in the issue or till withdrawal/failure of the issue or till withdrawal/rejection of the application, as the case may be.
- The SCSB shall upload the details in the electronic bidding system of the BSE or NSE.
- Once the basis of allotment is finalized, the Registrar to the Issue shall send an appropriate request to the SCSB for unblocking the relevant bank accounts and for transferring the requisite amount to the issuer's account. In case of withdrawal/failure of the issue, the amount shall be unblocked by the SCSB on receipt of information from the pre-issue merchant bankers.

The public issue of 20 microns was the first IPO to hit the market in September 2008 with ASBA facility for retail investors.

• ASBA is an application by retail investors for subscribing to an issue, containing an authorization to block the application money in a bank account.

• All investors including retail, high net worth individuals (HNIs), corporate investors, and qualified institutional buyers are eligible to apply through ASBA in public issues/rights issues.

- Incase of rights issues, all shareholders of the issuer company as on the record date are eligible, provided if he/she/it:
  - (a) is holding shares in dematerialized form and has applied for entitlements.
  - (b) is not a renouncee to the issue.
  - (c) applies through a bank account maintained with SCSBs.
- QIBs are prohibited to withdraw their bids after the close of the IPO, whereas retail and non-institutional bidders can withdraw till the day of allotment However retail investors are permitted to withdraw or downsize their bids until the finalization of allotment.

The SCSBs work as a single window intermediary – they collect applications, block application money in the investors' bank accounts, debit the investors' accounts, and transfer money to the escrow account on allotment of shares. The SCSB also sends aggregate information of total number of applications, shares bid for and amount to the registrar who will then reconcile the data and verify it for correctness with depository's data base. Thus, ASBA has simplified the share application and refund process.

The SEBI extended the ASBA facility to rights issues, The rights issues of TATA Motors and Sadhana Nitro Chem were the first to make use of this facility when the issues opened on September 29, 2008. In case of rights issues, all shareholders would be able to make use of this facility while in book-built public issues, it is the retail shareholders only who can make use of this facility. ASBA process in rights issue will enable a shareholder of the company as on record date to apply through ASBA mode by selecting the option of ASBA in the application form of rights issue to the SCSB with whom the bank account to be blocked is maintained. The rest of the process is similar to that of IPOs.

The SEBI extended this payment mode to all investors in public issues opening on or after May 1, 2010. The SEBI extended ASBA facility to the investors subscribing to new fund offers (NFOs) of mutual fund schemes launched on or offer July 1, 2010. In order to increase the spread and enhance the reach of ASBA the non-retail investors i.e, qualified institutional buyers and non-institutional investors (HNIs) making application in public/rights issues have mandatorily to make use ASBA facility.

Presently more than 99.5 per cent of the applications are received from centres where the application supported by blocked amount (ASBA) facility is available.

In order to substantially enhance the points for submission of applications, registrar and share transfer agents (RTAs) and depository participants (DPs) will also be allowed to accept application forms (both physical as well as on line) and make bids on the stock exchange platform. This will be over and above the stock brokers and banks where such facilities are already available.

The system was made effective for public issues which opened on or after January 01, 2016.

## **Allotment/Allocation in Book Built Issue**

In case an issuer company makes an issue of 100 per cent of the net offer to public through 100 per cent book building process:

- 1. not less than 35 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to retail individual investors;
- 2. not less than 15 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to non institutional investors *i.e.*, investors other than retail individual investors and qualified institutional buyers;
- 3. not more than 50 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers.

Provided that, in respect of issues made under Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules 1957 (issues for less than 25 per cent of the post-issue capital of the company), with 60 per cent mandatory allocation to qualified institutional buyers, the percentage allocation to retail individual investors and non-institutional investors shall be 30 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.

In an issue made through the book building process, the issuer may allocate upto 30 per cent of the portion available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers to an anchor investor.

Out of the portion available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers, 5 per cent shall be allocated proportionately to mutual funds. Mutual fund applicants shall also be eligible for proportionate allocation under the balance available for qualified institutional buyers.

Let us understand the allotment of shares to QIBs with the help of an illustration. Suppose the issue size is 100 crore shares, then 50 crore shares will be allocated to all QIBs including anchor investors, if any, and mutual funds. Out of 50 crore shares, anchor investors will be allocated 15 crore (30 per cent of 50 crore) shares and the remaining 35 crore shares will be allocated to the rest of the QIBs. Of the 35 crore shares, mutual funds will be allocated 1.75 crore (5 per cent of 35 crore) equity shares and the balance (33.5 equity shares) for all QIBs including mutual funds.

Allotment shall be made not later than 15 days from the closure of the issue failing which, interest at the rate of 15 per cent shall be paid to the investors.

According to Clause 2.1 (zd )of the SEBI ( Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2009, a QIB shall mean:

- a public financial institution as defined in Section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956;
- scheduled commercial banks;
- mutual funds;

- foreign institutional investors and sub-account (other than a sub-account which, is a foreign corporate or foreign individual), registered with the SEBI;
- multilateral and bilateral development financial institutions;
- venture capital funds registered with the SEBI;
- foreign venture capital investors registered with the SEBI;
- state industrial development corporations;
- insurance companies registered with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA);
- provident funds with the minimum corpus of  $\overline{z}25$  crores; and pension funds with the minimum corpus of  $\overline{\tau}25$  crores;
- National Investment Fund set up by resolution no. F.No.2/3/2005-DD11dated November 23, 2005 of the Government of India.

A retail individual investor is one (i) whose shareholding was of value not exceeding  $\overline{z}2,00,000$  as on the day immediately preceding the record date to be determined by the issuer, and (ii) who applies or bids for securities of or for a value of not more than  $\bar{\tau}2,00,000$ . He can bid in a book built issue for a value not more than  $\bar{\tau}1,00,000$ . If he bids in excess, the bid will be segregated under the high net worth individual (HNI) category or non-institution investor (NII) category.

Merchant bankers were earlier allowed some discretion while making allotments to institutional investors. Allocation to qualified institutional buyers was determined by the book running lead manager (BRLM) based on issues like prior commitment, investor quality, price aggression, and earliness of bids. SEBI banned discretionary allotments and introduced proportionate allotments in the QIB portion.

In case of book built issues, the basis of allotment is finalized by the BRLM within two weeks from the date of closure of the issue. The allotment of shares is done on a proportionate basis within the specified categories, rounded off to the nearest integer, with predetermined minimum allotment being equal to the minimum application size. Under the earlier guidelines, if an issue was oversubscribed, applicants were chosen by drawing lots and allotted a minimum of 100 shares per minimum tradeable lot.

The registrar then ensures that the demat credit or refund as applicable is completed within 15 days of the closure of the issue. The listing on the stock exchanges is done within seven days from the finalization of the issue.

## **Anchor Investor**

The SEBI introduced the concept of anchor investor on June 18, 2009 to enhance issuer's ability to sell the issue, generate more confidence in the minds of retail investors and better price discovery in the issue process. The anchor investor subscribes to the issue prior to its public opening, pay an upfront margin of 25 per cent and follows it up with the remaining 75 per cent within two days of the closure of the public issue, and holds the shares for atleast one month which instills confidence in retail investors and boosts the primary market. The anchor investor would be a qualified institutional buyer (QIB) and an issuer can allot up to 30 per cent of its institutional quota to such investors.The anchor investor/s cannot be related to the promoter or promoter group or the lead managers.

The Adani Power IPO in July 2009 was the first issue in the country to attract investors under the anchor investor scheme. The six anchor investors were T Rowe Price, AIC, Ecofin, TPG (through CLSA), Legg Mason, and Sundaram MF. SKS Micro Finance attracted 36 anchor investor in its IPO issue in August 2010. The guidelines provide various conditions for bringing in anchor investors in public issues:

1. An anchor investor shall make an application of a value of at least  $\overline{\tau}10$  crore in the public issue.

- 2. Allocation to anchor investors shall be on a discretionary basis and subject to the following:
- i. Maximum of 2 such investors shall be permitted for allocation upto  $\bar{\tau}10$  crore;
  - ii. Minimum of 2 and maximum of 15 such investors shall be permitted for allocation above  $\bar{\tau}10$ crore and upto  $\overline{z}250$  crore, subject to minimum allotment of  $\overline{z}5$  crore per such investor;
  - iii. In case of allocation beyond  $\overline{z}250$  crore, there can be ten additional anchor investors for every additional allocation of  $\overline{z}250$  crore subject to a minimum allotment of  $\overline{z}5$  crore per anchor investor. This step will help issuers who intend to raise large amounts of funds.
- 3. Upto 60 per cent of the portion available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers shall be available to anchor investor(s) for allocation/allotment (anchor investor portion).
- 4. One-third of the anchor investor portion shall be reserved for domestic mutual funds.
- 5. The bidding for anchor investors shall open one day before the issue opening date.
- 6. Anchor investors shall pay a margin of at least 25 per cent on application with the balance to be paid within two days of the date of closure of the issue.
- 7. Allocation to anchor investors shall be completed on the day of bidding by anchor investors

- The minimum application size for all investors has been increased to  $\bar{x}$ 10,000 –15,000. All retail individual investors shall be allotted at least the minimum application size, subject to availability of shares in this (RII) category. This would encourage wider retail participation in public issues. The remaining available shares, if any, shall be allotted on a proportionate basis.
- A retail investor is one who can bid in a book-built issue or applies for securities for a value of not more than `2,00,000.
- Anchor investors are qualified institutional buyers that buy a large chunk of shares a day before an IPO opens. They help arriving at an approximate benchmark price for share sales and generate confidence in retail investors.

- 8. If the price fixed as a result of book building is higher than the price at which the allocation is made to anchor investor, the anchor investor shall bring in the additional amount. However, if the price fixed as a result of book building is lower than the price at which the allocation is made to anchor investor, the excess amount shall not be refunded to the anchor investor and the anchor investor shall take allotment at the price at which allocation was made to it.
- 9. The number of shares allocated to anchor investors and the price at which the allocation is made, shall be made available in public domain by the merchant banker before opening of the issue.
- 10. There shall be a lock-in of 30 days on the shares allotted to the anchor investor from the date of allotment in the public issue.
- 11. Neither the merchant bankers nor any person related to the promoter/promoter group/merchant bankers in the concerned public issue can apply under anchor investor category. The parameters for selection of anchor investor shall be clearly identified by the merchant banker and shall be available as part of records of the merchant banker for inspection by the SEBI.
- 12. The applications made by qualified institutional buyers under the anchor investor category and under the non-anchor investor category may not be considered as multiple applications.

## **Benefits of Book Building Method**

Book building enables issuers to reap benefits arising from price and demand discovery. The aim of the process is to have the issue pre-sold and preclude chances of under-subscription/devolvement. The cost and time for making public issues is lowered; the procedures are also simplified. The public issue benefits investors as they can trust the price at which the syndicate members have purchased the shares. Due to this, the possibility of price falling below par after listing is remote.

## **Limitations of the Book Building Method**

The book building method is still at a nascent stage and not without limitations.

- The book building process adopted in India is quite different from that of the USA, wherein road shows are held and the issue price is arrived at a few hours before the issue opens. The lead manager makes a market in the paper by offering two-way quotes on the secondary market, till trading picks up. There are no such provisions in the Indian book building process.
- In India, unlike in the developed markets, the book building process is still dependent on good faith. The numbers of investors invited to apply are limited and it is the peer pressure and reputation that ensures that there are no defaults. Book building relies on much interaction among firms, merchant bankers, and investors, which is absent in India.
- There is a lack of transparency at critical steps of the book building process and the absence of strong regulation.
- Since the price fixed for the public portion as well as for the placement portion is the same, issues may not succeed in inviting the desired public response.
- It has not proved to be a good price discovery mechanism. Many issues have been listed below their issue price.
- Issuers may have to sell cheap due to the collective bargaining power of institutions.
- High institutionalized holding may affect the stock's liquidity and make it volatile as well in case of bulk offloading.
- The role of retail investors in determining the pricing decreases. Moreover, retail investors may not have the information to judge the issue and thus, may not be able to arrive at the correct pricing.
- The limits fixed are fungible and can be altered depending upon market conditions. If there is a low retail demand, more than 75 per cent of the issue size is allocated to institutional investors.
- Most book built IPOs, since 1999, have fared badly on the stock market—18 out of 19 are currently traded below their issue price. Only Balaji Telefilms is traded at a premium. The SEBI needs to reexamine the entire book building process at the operational level and, if need be, modify its guidelines.
- The book building system of ascertaining the cut-off price and the allocation to each applicant discriminate between return and institutional investors. It is heavily loaded against the retail or the high net worth investors to the advantage of qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Institutional investors can revise their bids, both quantity-wise as well as on the price, and back their bids with margin money up front and not the entire amount. This preferential treatment is not available to retail investors who have to back their bids with funds. Moreover, the merchant bankers to the issue have the discretion to allot to the institutional investors which results in a small proportional allotment to retail investors.
- The share of public offer in total capital has been reduced from 75 per cent to 25 per cent and in some cases, to 10 per cent. Effectively, retail now is allotted only 8.75 per cent (35 per cent of 25 per cent) and 3.5 per cent (35 per cent of 10 per cent) of a company's total capital.
- Book building is thrust upon the retail investors even though they cannot discover price. Institutional investors have the support of information and research that aids in price discovery.
- Many scrips prices rise/fall after listing and this reflects the extent of underpricing/overpricing. Hence, a more effective price discovery is needed to avoid underpricing/overpricing.

# **Auction-based Book Building**

The SEBI announced an additional method of auction-based book building known as pure auction for follow-on public issues in November 2009. In the regular book built issue, investors have to bid within the price band quoted by the merchant banker. This price band may not always represent the fair value. Hence, many issues have quoted at a discount in the post-listing trading sessions. Pure auction makes book building more market oriented and improves the price discovery process by allowing investors, rather than companies, to decide on the pricing of the issue. In pure auction, institutional bidders are free to bid at any price above the floor price mentioned by the company and allotment of shares will be done on a top down basis, starting from the highest bidder. Hence, each institutional investor could have a different allotment price. However, retail individual investors and non-institutional investors in such cases would be allotted shares at the floor price. The SEBI has permitted the issuer to place a cap in terms of the number of shares allotted to a single bidder and percentage to issued capital of the company in order that a single bidder does not garner all shares on offer and there is wider distribution. The biggest advantage of this is that it will bring down the institutional investors' oversubscription, as the institutional investors will bid for the quantity they intend to purchase and at a price which they are willing to purchase which will be above the floor price. They may quote a higher price to get a big block of shares at a single price. SEBI has not made it mandatory for companies coming out with follow-on public issues and it has given a choice to the companies—they can either opt for the book building or go for the pure auction or a combination of both.

# **Reverse Book Building**

Reverse book building is a process wherein the shareholders are asked to bid for the price at which they are willing to offer their shares. It is just similar to reverse auctions. This process helps in discovering the exit price and is used by companies who want to buy-back shares from the shareholders.

The process for reverse book building is as follows:

- The acquiring company secures board and shareholders approval to delist the shares.
- The acquirer shall appoint a designated BRLM to execute the process.
- The BRLM decides the floor price and the dates for inviting bids from the shareholders. The floor price shall not be less than the following: (a) where the equity shares are frequently traded in all the recognized stock exchanges where they are listed, the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the equity shares of the company during the 26 weeks or 2 weeks preceding the date on which the recognized stock exchanges were notified of the board meeting in which the delisting proposal was considered, whichever is higher, as quoted on the recognized stock exchange where the equity shares of the company are most frequently traded; (b) where the equity shares of the company are infrequently traded in all or some of the recognized stock exchanges, the floor price shall be determined by the BRLM taking into account the following factors: (i) the highest price paid by the promoter for acquisitions, if any, of equity shares of the class sought to be delisted, including by way of allotment in a public or rights issue or preferential allotment, during the 26 weeks period prior to the date on which the recognized stock exchanges were notified of the board meeting in which the delisting proposal was considered and after that date upto the date of the public announcement; and, (ii) other parameters including return on net worth, book value of the shares of the company, earning per share, price earning multiple vis-à-vis the industry average.
- The acquiring company shall, upon receipt of in principle approval for delisting from the recognized stock exchange, make a public announcement in at least one English national daily with wide circulation, one Hindi national daily with wide circulation, and one regional language newspaper of the region where the concerned recognized stock exchange is located.
- Before making the public announcement, the acquiring company shall open an escrow account and deposit therein the total estimated amount of consideration calculated on the basis of floor price and number of equity shares outstanding with public shareholders. The escrow account shall consist of either cash deposited with a scheduled commercial bank, or a bank guarantee in favour of the merchant banker, or a combination of both.

• Pure Auction is an additional method of book building in which the bidders would be free to bid at any price above the floor price and allotment would be on price priority basis and at differential prices. This method can be used only for FPOs.

• Reverse book building is a price-discovery mechanism for companies who want to buy-back shares from the shareholders.

- The acquiring company shall despatch the letter of offer to the public shareholders of equity shares, not later than 45 working days from the date of the public announcement, so as to reach them at least 5 working days before the opening of the bidding period. The letter of offer shall be sent to all public shareholders holding equity shares of the class sought to be delisted whose names appear on the register of the company or depository as on the date specified in the public announcement.
- The date of opening of the offer shall not be later than 55 working days from the date of the public announcement. The offer shall remain open for a minimum period of three working days and a maximum period of five working days, during which the public shareholders may tender their bids.
- Bidding will be done only in the electronic form and through the stock exchanges trading mechanism.
- The holders of physical equity shares may send their bidding form together with the share certificate and transfer deed to the trading member appointed for the purpose, who shall immediately after entering their bids on the system send them to the company or the share transfer agent for confirming their genuineness. The company or the share transfer agent shall deliver the certificates which are found to be genuine to the merchant banker, who shall not make it over to promoter unless the bids in respect thereof are accepted and payment made. The bids in respect of the certificates which are found to be not genuine shall be deleted from the system.
- The BRLM will give the list of trading members who are eligible to participate in the reverse book building process to the stock exchange.
- Bids will be placed through trading members at the bidding centres, whom the public shareholders may approach for placing bids on the on-line electronic system and will have to be made at or above the floor price.
- There is no cap on the bid price and revision of bids is possible. The shareholders may withdraw or revise their bids upwards not later than one day before the closure of the bidding period. Downward revision of bids is not permitted.
- The acquiring company shall not be bound to accept the equity shares at the offer price determined by the book building process. Where the acquiring company decides not to accept the offer price so determined:
  - a. The company shall not acquire any equity shares tendered pursuant to the offer and the equity shares deposited or pledged by a shareholder shall be returned or released to him within ten working days of closure of the bidding period.
  - b. The company shall not make the final application to the exchange for delisting of the equity shares.
  - c. The promoter may close the escrow account.
  - d. In a case where the public shareholding at the opening of the bidding period was less than the minimum level of public shareholding required under the listing agreement, the acquiring company shall ensure that the public shareholding shall be brought up to such minimum level within a period of six months from the date of closure of the bidding.
- Within eight working days of closure of the offer, the BRLM shall make a public announcement in the same newspapers in which the public announcement was made regarding:
  - a. the success of the offer alongwith the final price accepted by the acquirer; or
  - b. the failure of the offer;
  - c. rejection of the final price discovered by the promoters.
- Where, pursuant to acceptance of equity shares tendered in terms of these regulations, the equity shares are delisted, any remaining public shareholder holding such equity shares may tender his shares to the promoter upto a period of at least one year from the date of delisting and, in such a case, the promoter shall accept the shares tendered at the same final price at which the earlier acceptance of shares was made. The payment of consideration for shares accepted shall be made out of the balance amount lying in the escrow account.

• Delisting of securities means permanent removal of securities of a listed company from a stock exchange.

The reverse book building route is a difficult and costly process. Price discovery is a problem in case of small companies as their shares are thinly traded, making it difficult to delist through the reverse book building route. Unless the shares are delisted, the small companies have to pay all listing charges.

# **Conclusion**

The process, methodology, and structure of book building in India has improved over the last two years. The concept has yet to gain popularity among retail investors in India. This requires some modifications at the operational level. With proper safeguards and checks, this new issue mechanism can help in reviving investor confidence.

The entire IPO process should be speeded up through upgradation of the infrastructure to ensure that funds are not blocked for long.

# **Green-Shoe Option**

The SEBI permitted the green-shoe option in book building issues when it amended the guidelines in August 2003.

A green-shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue and operating a post-listing price stabilizing mechanism for a period not exceeding 30 days in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIIIA of the DIP guidelines. Green-shoe option is an option of over-allotting shares by an issuer to the underwriter in a public offering to provide post-listing price stability to an initial public offering. This option is to the extent of 15 per cent of the issue size. It is also referred to as an over-allotment option. Over allotment is an allotment or allocation of shares in excess of the size of a public issue, made by the SA out of shares borrowed from the promoters or the pre-issue shareholders or both, in pursuance of a green-shoe option exercised by the company in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter VIIIA of the DIP guidelines.

The guidelines relating to green-shoe option are as follows:

- A company desirous of availing the option should seek authorization in the general meeting for allotment of the additional shares to the stabilizing agent (SA) at the end of the stabilization period.
- The company should appoint one of the merchant bankers or book runners as the SA who will be responsible for the price stabilization process, if required. The SA should enter into an agreement with the issuer company, prior to filing the offer document with the SEBI, clearly stating all the terms and conditions relating to this option including fees charged/expenses to be incurred by the SA for this purpose.
- The SA should also enter into an agreement with the promoter(s) who will lend their shares. The agreement should specify the maximum number of shares that may be borrowed from the promoters or the shareholders which should not be in excess of 15 per cent of the total issue size. The details of the agreements shall be disclosed in the draft prospectus, the draft red herring prospectus, the red herring prospectus, and the final prospectus.
- Green-shoe option (GSO) is also referred to as an overallotment option. It is a mechanism to provide post-listing price stability to an initial public offering. The Green-shoe company was the first to issue this type of option, hence the name green-shoe option.

- The promoters and pre-issue shareholders, of both unlisted and listed company, holding more than 5 per cent shares should lend the shares for the purpose of green-shoe option.
- The allocation of these shares should be on pro-rata basis to all the applicants. The stabilization mechanism should be made available for not more than 30 days from the date when trading is permitted on the exchange(s).
- The SA shall open a special account with a bank to be referred to as the GSO Bank account and a special account for securities with a depository participant to be referred to as the GSO Demat Account.
- The money received from the applicants against the over-allotment in the green-shoe option shall be kept in the GSO Bank Account, distinct from the issue account and shall be used for the purpose of buying shares from the market, during the stabilization period.
- The shares bought from the market by the SA, if any, during the stabilization period, shall be credited to the GSO Demat Account. The shares bought from the market and lying in the GSO Demat Account shall be returned to the promoters immediately, in any case not later than two working days after the close of the stabilization period.
- The prime responsibility of the SA shall be to stabilize post-listing price of the shares. To this end, the SA shall determine the timing of buying the shares, the quantity to be bought, the price at which the shares are to be bought, etc.
- On expiry of the stabilization period, in case the SA does not buy shares to the extent of shares overallotted by the company from the market, the issuer company shall allot shares to the extent of the shortfall in dematerialized form to the GSO Demat Account, within five ( ) days of the closure of the stabilization period. These shares shall be returned to the promoters by the SA in lieu of the shares borrowed from them and the GSO Demat Account shall be closed thereafter. The company shall make a final listing application in respect of these shares to all the Exchanges where the shares allotted in the public issue are listed. The provisions of Chapter XIII shall not be applicable to such allotment.
- The shares returned to the promoters shall be subject to the remaining lock-in period.
- The SA shall remit an amount equal to (further shares allotted by the issuer company to the GSO Demat Account) \* (issue price) to the issuer company from the GSO Bank Account. The amount left in this account, if any, after this remittance and deduction of expenses incurred by the SA for the stabilization mechanism, shall be transferred to the investor protection fund(s) of the stock exchange(s) where the shares of issuer company are listed, in equal parts if the shares are listed in more than one exchanges. The GSO Bank Account shall be closed soon thereafter.
- The SA shall submit a report to the stock exchange(s) on a daily basis during the stabilization period and a final report to SEBI in the format specified in Schedule XXIX. The SA shall maintain a register in respect of each issue having the green-shoe option in which he acts as a SA.

A stabilizing agent (SA) steps in and buys the shares from the market when the share price falls below the offer price. He has the discretion to decide the timing, the quantity and the price at which to buy shares for stabilizing the post-listing price. To ensure the post-listing price, the SA may either buy the issuer's equity shares from institutional shareholders or purchase them from the market but not in excess of 15 per cent of the issue size. The issuer may set up a separate stabilizing fund account to keep the funds as well as the shares for purpose of stabilization. The stabilizing measure serves as a cushion against temporary volatility in stock. The SA is also responsible for meeting the excess demand after the commencement of the trading activity. On expiry of the stabilization period, in case the SA does not buy shares to the extent of shares over-allotted by the company from the market, the issuer company shall allot shares to the extent of the shortfall in dematerialized form.

The first-ever exercise of a green-shoe option in the course of a public issue was carried out by the ICICI Bank. The Life Insurance Corporation became the first institution to lend shares in the primary market. It provided 16 million shares to the DSP Merill Lynch to ensure the post-listing price.

If the issuer company opts for green-shoe option, the mechanism is as follows:

- 1. If a company is issuing 1,000 shares, the company will enter into an agreement regarding overallotment option (lending excess shares) with one of the merchant bankers or book runners or lead managers known as the stabilizing agent (SA) to the extent of 150 shares.
- 2. In pursuance with the agreement, the promoters would lend 150 shares to the SA for a limited period of 30 days from the date of listing.
- 3. Allotment would be made to the extent of 1,150 shares (1,000 shares issued by the company and 150 borrowed from the promoters).
- 4. In case, on listing, the market price falls below the issue price, the SA may buy shares from the market to the extent of 150 shares. This may counter the selling pressure and raise the market

price. The shares bought by the SA are then returned to the promoters. Thus, only 1,000 shares remain listed on the exchange after 30 days.

5. In case, on listing, the share price rises rapidly, and the SA does not buy the shares from the market, then at the end of the 30 days period (or before) the over-allotment option gets invoked. The company allots 150 more shares which are then returned to the promoters. Thus, 1,150 shares remain listed on the exchange.

The green-shoe option is an investor protection measure–especially for protection of small investors during the post-listing period. This option benefits the underwriters in both bullish and bearish conditions. In a bull market, underwriters will opt for additional allotment of 15 per cent due to the index riding high. In such a scenario, the post-listing price will be automatically maintained and sometimes even higher than the offer price, enabling underwriters to make larger profits. However, in a bearish market, the underwriting option may not be exercised or the underwriters may buy up to 15 per cent at prices lower than the issue price from the market.

Earlier, the green-shoe option could be exercised only in book built IPOs. Now it can be exercised in all IPOs. This measure is expected to mitigate volatility and enhance investors' confidence.

Primary issuances by companies are governed by the SEBI in terms of SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009. They are called as ICDR Regulations. These regulations replace the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines from August 26, 2009.

The broad process flow by using the secondary market infrastructure for primary issuance is as under: Investor will be able to submit his application to/ place order with any SEBI registered Stock Broker, Depository Participant (DP) or Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA)and Self Certified Syndicate Bank (SCSB).

Depositories can take access to the Stock Exchange platform and in turn provide the same to their DPs/ RTAs (other than the RTA, who acts as the RTA to the particular issue, to address the concerns of conflict of interest).

Investor will continue to have the option of submitting Application Supported by Blocked Amount ("ASBA") application to SCSB or stock broker. To start with, DP and RTA shall accept only ASBA applications. However, they may be enabled to accept non-ASBA applications in future subject to appropriate changes in the regulatory framework, as may be necessary.

Investors can also fill the application form online and submit it on the web portal of trading member, DP/RTA or SCSB (in case of ASBA), if provided by the intermediary.

Under this case, the investor will not be required to physically sign any paper as even the Companies Act, 2013 recognizes the electronic form of a document. This will help eliminate printing application form and thereby reduce the overall cost of public issuance.

On receipt of application, the Stock Broker/DP/RTA/SCSB will have to lodge the application on the bidding platform. Once the bid has been entered in the bidding platform by a stock broker, clearing corporation will block 100 per cent funds from the cash collateral of the stock broker. National Payments Corporation of India ("NPCI") has implemented National Automated Clearing House ("NACH") a web based solution to facilitate interbank, high volume, electronic transactions which are repetitive and periodic in nature. NACH is a centralised system, launched with an aim to consolidate multiple ECS systems running

## **Box 6.1** The Green-Shoe Option

In the case of an initial public offering (IPO) by India's largest technology company—Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)—there was a green-shoe option available to the lead book runner JM Morgan Stanley, its stabilizing agent (SA).

It was the volatility on the stock market before its IPO that prompted TCS to set up a stabilizing fund to ensure that the market price upon listing did not go below the offer price of ₹850 per share. Incidentally, following its listing on August 25, 2004 at  $\bar{\mathcal{J}}$ 1,076 per share, the stock price did not go below  $\bar{\mathcal{J}}$ 850 during the 30 days after the trading commenced.

However, this kind of an appointment of an SA to support stock prices had earlier met with failure. In April 2004, ICICI Bank, which came out with a public issue of 12.50 crore shares to mop up ₹3,500 crore, had appointed DSP Merill Lynch as the stabilizing agent as a cushion against temporary volatility in the stock. DSP was supposed to check that the share price never once went below the cut-off price of ₹280 per share. However, shareholders got a rude shock when the share price closed at ₹265–₹15 lower than the issue price–on May 14, 2004. The stabilization period was to end on May 22, 2004. No sooner did the stock open at ₹284 in morning trades, the sale of 130 crore shares led the price to dive to ₹277. On receiving support at this level from DSP, the share price rose to ₹280. But, shortly thereafter, with trading volumes reaching ₹33 crore on BSE and ₹100 crore on NSE, the scrip tanked below the issue price. It was DSP's purchase of 24.79 lakh shares (almost 50 per cent of the traded volume) on a single day that helped the stock to fall only 6.95 per cent, as against the average decline of 15 per cent in other bank stocks on that day.

across the country and provides a framework for the harmonization of standard and practices and removes local barriers/inhibitors. Stock brokers will be advised to use the said NACH mechanism and thereby receive upfront payment from the investor. Through NACH system, an investor can give instructions to its banker for multiple debits at different points of time for making IPO applications. This will help eliminate the delay on account of cheques in the process.

For ASBA applications lodged with stock broker, existing process will continue. For bids made through depository participant and RTA, subsequent to bidding, the application will be forwarded to Self Certified Syndicate Bank ("SCSB") for blocking of funds. For direct ASBA applications, existing process of bidding and blocking of funds by the SCSB shall continue.

Investors will not be able to withdraw bids upon closure of the issue. Upon closure of the issue, the bid book shall be made available to the registrar by stock exchanges and depositories. Details of payment confirmation for the bids will be made available by banks, and clearing corporation to the registrars.

Based on the bid file and payment confirmations, registrars will finalise the basis of allotment.

On approval of basis of allotment by stock exchanges, registrars will give instructions to clearing corporations and banks to credit funds in the public issue account maintained by the clearing corporation. Excess money received will be refunded to the investors by the stock broker/bank, as the case may be. Upon confirmation of receipt of public issue amount by the clearing corporation to the registrar, instruction will be issued to depositories to credit securities directly to the investor's account.

On confirmation of the same, Stock Exchanges will issue the listing and trading notice. Based on trading notice, funds will be transferred from public issue account of the clearing corporation to issuer's account. Investors would get SMS/e-mail alert for allotment under the IPO, similar to alerts being sent to investors for secondary market transactions.

On account of the above, the post issue timelines have been reduced from  $T + 12$  days to  $T + 6$  days. Once the process gets stabilised, SEBI plans to further curtail timelines to  $T + 3/2$  days. Further, on account of reduction in printing of application forms, the overall cost of public issues will also come down.

Primary Issues are classified into Public issue, Rights issue and Private placement (Figure 6.1).

## **Public Issue**

Companies making public issue of securities need to comply with public issue requirements prescribed in Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, apart from the requirements of SEBI Regulations.

Companies Act requires a company proposing to make a public issue to make a listing application to recognized stock exchanges. It requires the issuing company to file a Prospectus with Registrar of Companies. Further, detailed disclosure requirements for Prospectus are also specified.

Under Section 24 of the Companies Act, 2013, the provisions relating to issue and transfer of securities by listed companies or those companies which intend to get their securities listed on any recognized stock exchange in India shall be administered by SEBI. Hence, SEBI regulates public issuance of securities and those private placements which are proposed to be listed on stock exchange(s).

SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR) requires issuers making public issue of specified securities to comply with requirements prescribed therein which includes appointment of merchant banker, registrar to issue, filing of draft offer document with SEBI, eligibility requirement such as track record, minimum promoter's contribution, lock-in requirements, requirement to have a monitoring agency, etc., apart from detailed disclosure requirements.

However, in case of debt securities, there is a simpler regime and the issuer need to comply with SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 (ILDS), which requires compliance with basic requirements like having a debenture trustee, credit rating, disclosure requirements, etc. Further, once securities are listed in a recognized stock exchange, the issuer has to comply with the continuous listing requirements.

# *Initial Public Offering (IPO)*

It is an offering of either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of existing securities or both by an unlisted company for the first time to the public.

In the case of an IPO, the availability of information regarding the past performance of the company and its track record is generally inadequate and may lack credibility. This information asymmetry may lead to the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. To enable investors to take informed decisions and protect their interests, the SEBI has laid down stringent entry norms.

A follow-on public offering (FPO) is an offering of either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale to the public by an already listed company through an offer document. Investors participating in these offerings take informed decisions based on its track record and performance.

• Initial Public Offering is an offering of either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of existing securities, or both by an unlisted company for the first time to the public. IPO enables listing and trading of the issuer's securities.

The SEBI has laid down eligibility norms for entities raising funds through an IPO and an FPO. The entry norms for making an IPO of equity shares or any other security which may be converted into or exchanged with equity shares at a later date are as follows:

### **Primary Issues**

![](1__page_24_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 6.1** Primary Issues

**Entry Norm I** It is commonly known as 'Profitability Route.' The company desiring to tap the primary market shall meet the following requirements:

- Net tangible assets of atleast  $\overline{\tau}3$  crores for three full years, of which not more than 50 per cent is held in monetary assets.
- Distributable profits in atleast three out of the preceding five years both on stand-alone as well as on consolidated basis With a minimum average pre-tax operating profit during the three most profitable years of  $\bar{\tau}$ 15 crore. Issuers not meeting with this requirement may come out with IPOs, if the issuer undertakes to allot at least 75 per cent of the net offer to QIBs.
- Net worth of atleast  $\bar{\tau}1$  crore in three years.
- If there is a change in the company's name, atleast 50 per cent revenue for preceding one year should be earned from the new activity.
- The issue size should not exceed 5 times the pre-issue net worth as per the audited balance sheet of the last financial year.

To provide sufficient flexibility and also to ensure that genuine companies are not deprived, an access to the primary market on account of rigidity of the parameters, the SEBI has provided two other alternative routes to a company not meeting any of the above mentioned requirements. They are as follows:

**Entry Norm II** It is commonly known as 'QIB Route.'

- Issue shall be through a book building route, with atleast 50 per cent of the issue to be mandatorily allotted to the qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), failing which the money shall be refunded.
- The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be  $\bar{\tau}10$  crore or there shall be compulsory market making for atleast 2 years. OR

**Entry Norm III** It is commonly known as 'Appraisal Route'.

- The 'project' is appraised and participated to the extent of 15 per cent by FIs/scheduled commercial banks of which atleast 10 per cent comes from the appraiser(s). In addition, atleast 10 per cent of the issue size shall be allotted to QIBs, failing which the full subscription monies shall be refunded.
- The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be  $\overline{\tau}10$  crore or there shall be a compulsory market making for atleast 2 years.

In addition to satisfying the aforesaid eligibility norms, the company shall also satisfy the criteria of having atleast 1,000 prospective allottees in its issue.

The SEBI has exempted the following entities from entry norms:

- Private sector banks.
- Public sector banks.

• Prospectus is an offer document in case of a public issue. It has all relevant details including price and number of shares being offered. It is registered with ROC after the closure of issue in case of a book built issue.

- An infrastructure company whose project has been appraised by a PFI or IDFC or IL&FS or a bank which was earlier a PFI and not less than 5 per cent of the project cost is financed by any of these institutions.
- Rights issue by a listed company.

A company cannot make a public or rights issue of debt instruments (whether convertible or not), unless it fulfills the following two conditions: credit rating of not less than investment grade is obtained from not less than two SEBI registered credit rating agencies, and it should not be in the list of wilful defaulters of the Reserve Bank. Moreover, it should not have defaulted payment of interest or repayment of principal, if any, for a period of more than six months.

An issuer company should not allot non-convertible debt instrument pursuant to a public issue, if the proposed allottees are less than fifty. In such a case, the company shall have to refund the entire subscription amount received; a delay beyond eight days attracts a penal charge of 15 per cent per annum.

An unlisted company shall not make a public issue of equity share or any security convertible at later date into equity share, if there are any outstanding financial instruments or any other right that would entitle the existing promoters or shareholders any option to receive equity share capital after the initial public offering.

A company shall not make a public or rights issue of equity share or any security convertible at later date into equity share, unless all the existing partly paid-up shares have been fully paid or forfeited in a manner specified in the guidelines. A company shall not make a public or rights issue of securities unless firm arrangements of finance through verifiable means towards 75 per cent of the stated means of finance, excluding the amount to be raised through proposed public/rights issue, have been made.

In order to enable investors assess new equity issues offered through an IPO, the issuer has to get IPO grading done by atleast one credit rating agency, before filing the offer documents with SEBI or thereafter. However, the prospectus/Red Herring Prospectus must contain the grade/s given to the IPO by all credit rating agencies.

In case of a public issue by an unlisted company, the promoters shall contribute not less than 20 per cent of the post issue capital which should be locked in for a period of three years. The remaining pre-issue capital should also be locked in for a period of one year from the date of listing. Lock-in indicates a freeze on the shares and it is stipulated to ensure that promoters continue to hold some minimum percentage of shares in the company. Promoters' Participation in Excess of the required minimum contribution will be to treated as preferential allotment. Securities which were pledged with banks or financial institutions as collateral security for loans granted by such banks or financial institutions, would not be eligible for computation of minimum promoters' contribution in case of company going for public issue. In order to capital raising by companies founded by professionals, first generation entrepreneurs and in case the post-issue shareholding of the promoters is less than 20 per cent, the Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) may contribute for the purpose of meeting the shortfall in minimum contribution, subject to a maximum of 10 per cent of the post-issue capital.

Every issuer making an issue of more than  $\overline{3500}$  crore is required to appoint a monitoring agency, which needs to file a monitoring report with the issuer company. The issuer company will in turn place the report before its Audit Committee so as to enable the Audit Committee to make appropriate recommendations to the Board of the issuer company. Further, every issuer company is required to inform material deviations in the utilization of issue proceeds to the stock exchange and to simultaneously make public the material deviations/adverse comments of the Audit Committee/monitoring agency, through an advertisement in newspapers. This provision will not apply to (i) issues by banks and public financial institutions and (ii) offers for sale.

An issuer company has to file draft prospectus with the SEBI through a merchant banker, at least 30 days prior to the filing of the prospectus with the Registrar of Companies (ROC). The SEBI may specify changes, if any, in the draft offer document which shall have to be complied with the issuer or the lead merchant banker before filing the offer document (prospectus) with the ROC/SEs. The draft offer document is available on the SEBI website for public comments for a period of 21 days from the filing of the draft offer. The merchant banker has to ensure that all the requirements of the DIP (disclosure and investor protection) guidelines are complied with while submitting the draft offer document to the SEBI.

Some of the pertinent information that has to be disclosed in the offer document relate to earnings per share (EPS), pre-issue EPS for the last three years, pre-issue price–earnings ratio (P/E), average return on net worth in the last three years, minimum return on increased net worth required to maintain pre-issue EPS, net-asset value (NAV) per share based on last balance sheet, NAV per share after issue and comparison, thereof, with the issue price and comparison of all the accounting ratios of the issuer company. Other information include credit rating, risks in relation to the first issue, risk factors–internal and external, details of underwriting agreements, objects of the offering, funding plan, schedule of implementation, dividend policy, material developments since last balance sheet date and legal and statuary disclosures.

A company has to file a draft offer document with the SEBI atleast 21 days prior to the filing of the offer document with the registrar of companies (ROC) and stock exchanges (SEs). The SEBI may specify changes

- 'Offer document' means prospectus in case of a public issue or offer for sale and letter of offer in case of a rights issue.
- Listed company means a company which has any of its securities offered through an offer document listed on a recognized stock exchange and also includes public sector undertakings whose securities are listed on a recognized stock exchange.
- Offer for sale means offer of securities by existing shareholder(s) of a company to the public for subscription, through an offer document.
- Public issue means an invitation by a company to the public to subscribe to the securities offered through a prospectus
- Issuer company means a company which has filed offer documents with the SEBI for making issue of securities.

if any, in the draft offer document which shall have to be complied with the issuer or the lead merchant banker before filing the offer document (prospectus) with the ROC/SEs. The draft offer document is available on the SEBI website for public comments for a period of 21 days from the filing of the draft offer. The SEBI has extended the validity period of IPO's and rights issues to one year from three months. The SEBI issues observations in 21 days and the companies can raise the funds (launch IPO) within one year from the day when these observations were issued. The merchant banker has to ensure that all the requirements of the DIP (disclosure and investor protection) guidelines are complied with while submitting the draft offer document to the SEBI. In order to enable investors assess equity issues offered through an IPO the issuer has to get IPO grading done either before filling the offer documents with SEBI or thereafter. However, the prospectus/red herring prospectus must contain the grade(s) given to the IPO by all credit rating agencies.

The issuer is allowed to freely price the issue. The issuer and the merchant banker have to justify the issue price in the prospectus. There are two methods for determining the issue price–fixed price and the book building route. In the fixed price method, the issuer, in consultation with the merchant banker, decides the price of the issue while in book building, the issuer and the merchant bankers (book running lead manager) stipulate a floor price or a price band but the final price is discovered by market forces. On completion of the bidding process, the cut-off price is arrived at on the lines of 'Dutch' auction and the basis of allotment is finalized. The final price discovered can be any price in the price band or any price above the floor price. Usually it is the price at which the entire issue is exhausted. This issue price is called cut-off price. An issuer can go for differential pricing, *i.e.*, pricing of an issue where one category is offered shares at a price different from the other category. In the DIP guidelines, differential pricing is allowed only if the securities to applicants in the firm allotment category is at a price higher than the price at which the net offer to the public is made. An issuer company can allot the shares to retail individual investors at a discount of maximum 10 per cent to the price at which the shares are offered to other categories of public. The final prospectus with all the details including the final issue price and the issue size is filed with the registrar of companies (ROC).

After the closure of the issue, the bids received are segregated under different categories viz., firm allotment, qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), non-institutional buyers, and retail investors. A firm allotment is the allotment to the investor on firm basis. An issuer making an issue to the public can allot shares on firm basis to Indian and multilateral development financial Institutions, Indian mutual funds, foreign institutional investors including non-resident Indians, permanent/regular employees of the issuer company, and scheduled banks. The ICDR Regulations guidelines provide for maximum percentage of shares which can be reserved on a firm basis. Reservation on a competitive basis can be made in a public issue to the employees of the company, shareholders of the promoting company in case of a new company, and shareholders of the group companies in case of an existing company. Indian mutual funds, foreign institutional investors, Indian and multilateral development institutions and scheduled banks are categorized as qualified institutional buyers. Retail individual investor(RII) means an investor who applies or bids for securities for a value of not more than  $\bar{x}1,00,000$ . Investors who do not fall within the definition of retail investor and QIB are categorized as 'Non-institutional Investors' (NII). Any investor who wants to invest in an issue should have a PAN which is required to be mentioned in the application form.

Allotment to various investor categories is as follows:

### **In case of book built issue**

- 1. In case an issuer company makes an issue of 100 per cent of the net offer to the public through 100 per cent book building process
  - a. Not less than 35 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to retail individual investors;
  - b. Not less than 15 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to non-institutional investors, *i.e.*, investors other than retail individual investors and qualified institutional buyers;
  - c. Not more than 50 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to the qualified institutional buyers.
- 2. In case of compulsory book built issues at least 50 per cent of net offer to the public being allotted to the qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), failing which the full subscription monies shall be refunded.
- 3. In case the book built issues are made pursuant to the requirement of mandatory allocation of 60 per cent to QIBs in terms of Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules, 1957, the respective figures are 30 per cent for RIIs and 10 per cent for NIIs.

**In case of fixed price issue** The proportionate allotment of securities to the different investor categories in an fixed price issue is as follows:

- 1. A minimum 50 per cent of the net offer of securities to the public shall initially be made available for allotment to retail individual investors, as the case may be.
- Allotment of shares is done within 15 days after the closure of an IPO. The SEBI reduced the time between public issue closure and listing to 6 days from January 1, 2016.

- 2. The balance net offer of securities to the public shall be made available for allotment to: a. Individual applicants other than retail individual investors, and
  - b. Other investors including corporate bodies/institutions irrespective of the number of securities applied for.

After the closure of the issue, allotment to each investor is done based on proportionate basis within their respective categories in both book built and fixed price public issue. The oversubscription ratios are calculated for each of the categories as against the shares reserved for each of the categories in the offer document. Within each of these categories, the bids are then segregated into different buckets based on the number of shares applied for. The oversubscription ratio is then applied to the number of shares applied for and the number of shares to be allotted for applicants in each of the buckets is determined. Then, the number of successful allottees is determined. All the public issues of size in excess of  $\overline{\tau}10$  crore are to be made compulsorily in dematerialized form.

An investor can get allotment/refund of shares in case of fixed price public issues within 30 days of the closure of the issue and in case of book built public issues within 15 days of the closure of the issue. In case of a listed company, the aggregate issue size of the proposed issue along with all the previous issues made during the financial year should not exceed five times its pre-issue net worth as per the audited balance sheet of the last financial year. If the name of the company has been changed in the last one year, then the revenue accounted for by the activity suggested by the new name should not be less than 50 per cent of its total revenue in the preceding one full-year period.

The Companies Act, 2013 provides that a company which has raised money from the public through a prospectus and still has any unutilised money so raised, will not change its objects for which it raised the money through a prospectus or vary the terms of a contract referred to in the prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by the company. The Companies Act, 2013 also provides that the dissenting shareholders will be given an exit opportunity by the promoters and the shareholders having control over the company in such manner and with such conditions as may be specified by SEBI by making regulations in this behalf.

Accordingly, SEBI has introduced an elaborate framework specifying conditions for the exit offer, the parameters for pricing, procedures, etc. The framework has been made applicable for issues which opened after April 01, 2014 and where the amount to be utilised for the objects for which the prospectus was issued is less than 75 per cent of the amount raised (including the amount earmarked for general corporate purposes as disclosed in the offer document), subject to the proposal for the change in the objects being dissented against by at least 10 per cent of the shareholders.

No company can make a public or rights issue of debt instruments (whether convertible or not), unless it fulfils the following two conditions: credit rating of not less than investment grade is obtained from not less than two SEBI registered credit rating agencies, and it should not be in the list of wilful defaulters of the Reserve Bank. Moreover, it should not have defaulted payment of interest or repayment of principal, if any, for a period of more than six months.

An issuer company should not allot non-convertible debt instrument pursuant to a public issue, if the proposed allottees are less than fifty. In such a case, the company shall have to refund the entire subscription amount received, a delay beyond eight days attracts a penal charge of 15 per cent per annum.

A record number of mega issues were floated after the reforms. An issue of a minimum size of  $\overline{5}100$ crore is a mega issue.

Most of the IPOs are quoted at a premium to their offer price on getting listed.

### *Follow-on Public Offering (FPO)*

It is an offer of sale of securities by a listed company. FPO is also known as subsequent or seasoned public offering. SEBI (DIP) Guidelines define a listed company as a company which has any of its securities offered through an offer document listed on a recognized stock exchange and also includes public sector undertakings whose securities are listed on a recognized stock exchange. Listed companies issue FPOs to finance their growth plans. In case of a listed company, the aggregate issue size of the proposed issue along with all the previous issues made during the same financial year in terms of size (*i.e.*, offer through offer document+firm allotment+promoters' contribution) through the offer document should not exceed five times its pre-issue net worth as per the audited balance sheet of the last financial year. If the name of the company has been changed in the last one year, then the revenue accounted for by the activity suggested by the new name should not be less than 50 per cent of its total revenue in the preceding one full-year period. Any listed company not fulfilling these conditions shall be eligible to make a public issue by complying with QIB route or appraisal route as specified for IPOs. In addition, the promoters shall contribute not less than 20 per cent of the post-issue capital or 20 per cent of the issue size. Moreover, participation by promoters in the proposed public issue in excess of the required minimum percentage

In order to avoid the mis-utilisation of issue proceeds and to ensure that the issuers use the issue proceeds only in bank deposits that are not market linked, the net issue proceeds, pending utilisation, have to be deposited by the issuers only in scheduled commercial banks.

shall attract the pricing provisions of guidelines on preferential allotment, if the issue price is lower than the price as determined on the basis of said preferential allotment guidelines.

SEBI has introduced fast track issues (FTI) in order to enable well-established and compliant listed companies satisfying certain specific entry norms/conditions to raise equity through follow-on and rights issues. These norms reduce the process of issue and thereby the time period thus enabling issuers a quick access to primary capital market. Such companies can proceed with follow-on public offers (FPOs)/right issues by filing a copy of Red Herring Prospectus (RHP)/prospectus with the registrar of companies (RoC) or the letter of offer with designated stock exchange (SE), SEBI and stock exchanges. Moreover, such companies are not required to file draft offer document for SEBI comments and to stock exchanges as the relevant information is already in the public domain.

The entry norms for companies seeking to access primary market through FTI's in case aggregate value of securities including premium exceeds  $\overline{50}$  lakhs:

- 1. The shares of the company have been listed on any stock exchange having nationwide terminals for a period of at least three years immediately preceding the date of filing of offer document with RoC/SE.
- 2. The 'average market capitalization of public shareholding' of the company is at least  $\overline{\tau}1,000$ crores for a period of one year up to the end of the quarter preceding the month in which the proposed issue is approved by the board of directors/shareholders of the issuer;
- 3. The annualized trading turnover of the shares of the company during six calendar months immediately preceding the month of the reference date has been at least 2 per cent of the weighted average number of shares listed during the said six months period;
- 4. The company has redressed at least 95 per cent of the total shareholder/investor grievances or complaints received till the end of the quarter immediately preceding the month of the date of filing of offer document with RoC/SE.
- 5. The company has complied with the listing agreement for a period of at least three years immediately preceding the reference date;
- 6. The impact of auditors' qualifications, if any, on the audited accounts of the company in respect of the financial years for which such accounts are disclosed in the offer document does not exceed 5 per cent of the net profit/loss after tax of the company for the respective years;
- 7. No prosecution proceedings or show cause notices issued by the Board are pending against the company or its promoters or whole time directors as on the reference date; and
- 8. The entire shareholding of the promoter group is held in dematerialized form as on the reference date. For the purposes of this clause:
  - a. 'Reference date' shall mean:
    - i. in case of a public issue of securities by a listed company satisfying all the requirements specified in this clause, the date of filing of Red Herring Prospectus (in case of a book built issue) or prospectus (in case of a fixed price issue) with ROC; and
    - ii. in case of a rights issue of securities by a listed company satisfying all the requirements specified in this clause, the date of filing of letter of offer with designated stock exchange.
  - b. 'Average market capitalization of public shareholding' shall mean the sum of daily market capitalization of 'public shareholding' for a period of one year up to the end of the quarter preceding the month in which the proposed issue was approved by the Board/shareholders, as the case may be, divided by the number of trading days.

Listed companies with a good track record find it easier to raise funds through FPOs. Because of cumbersome procedural requirements and high cost and time, the FPOs are no longer an attractive route to raise funds. Listed companies are increasingly preferring the rights issue or Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP) route to raise funds.

### *Regulations for Issuance and Listing of Non-convertible Redeemable Preference Shares*

The SEBI (Issue and Listing of Non-Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares) Regulations, 2013 were framed by SEBI thereby providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for issuance and listing of nonconvertible redeemable preference shares.

Considering the risks involved in the instrument, certain requirements like minimum tenure of the instruments (three years), minimum rating ("AA–" or equivalent) etc. have been specified in case of public issuances. For listing of privately placed nonconvertible redeemable preference shares, minimum application size for each investor is fixed at rupees Ten Lakhs.

As per Basel III norms, Banks can issue nonequity instruments such as Perpetual Non-Cumulative preference Shares and Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments, which are in compliance with the specified criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier I Capital. The proposed Regulations shall, mutatis mutandis, be applicable to aforesaid instruments issued by banks, subject to compliance with the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 or/and any other applicable laws and such other conditions that may be specified by SEBI and subject to making adequate disclosures and relevant risk factors in the offer document.

# **Rights Issue**

• Rights issue is an offer of new securities by a listed company to its existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis.

Rights issue means an issue of capital under Sub-section (1) of Section 81 of the Companies Act,1956, to be offered to the existing shareholders of the company through a letter of offer. The SEBI (ICDR) Regulations define rights issue as an offer of specified securities by a listed issuer to the shareholders of the issuer as on the record date fixed for the said purpose; Section 81(1) of the Companies Act, specifies the mode of making a rights issue. As per Clause (a) of this section, the rights shares 'shall be offered to the persons who, at the date of the offer, are holders of equity shares of the company, in proportion, as nearly as circumstances admit, to the capital paid-up on those shares at that date.' Thus, for deciding the rights entitlement, only the capital paid up on each share is relevant.

Rights issue is the issue of new shares in which existing shareholders are given pre-emptive rights to subscribe to the new issue on a pro-rata basis. The right is given in the form of an offer to existing shareholders to subscribe to a proportionate number of fresh, extra shares at a pre-determined price. Companies offer shares on a rights basis either to expand, diversify, restructure their balance sheet or raise the promoter stake.

Promoters offer rights issues at attractive price often at a discount to the market price due to a variety of reasons. Firstly, they want to get their issues fully subscribed to. Secondly, to reward their shareholders. Thirdly, it is possible that the market price does not reflect a stock's true worth or that it is overpriced, prompting promoters to keep the offer price low. Fourthly, to hike their stake in their companies, thus, avoiding the preferential allotment route which is subject to lot of restrictions. Moreover, funds can be raised by a company through this route without diluting the stakes of both its existing shareholders and promoters.

Rights Issue is different from public issue:

- In a rights issue, new shares are offered to existing shareholders while in a public issue shares are offered to public at large.
- In case of rights, shareholders can renounce their 'rights entitlement' (REs) while there is no rights entitlement in case of public issue.
- Rights shares are allotted based on shareholding as on record date as against 'proportionate allotment' based on application size in public issues. All details of shareholders on a record date is available with the company, other than those who have purchased RE from the market and become eligible for rights issue subsequently.

According to the SEBI guidelines, no listed issuer company shall make any rights issue of securities, where the aggregate value of such securities, including premium, if any, exceeds  $\overline{50}$  lakh, unless a draft letter of offer has been filed with the SEBI, through a merchant banker, at least 30 days prior to the filing of the letter of offer with the designated stock exchange.

The ICDR regulations put restrictions on the issue of rights shares: (a) No issuer shall make a rights issue of equity shares if it has outstanding fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of making rights issue, unless it has made reservation of equity shares of the same class in favour of the holders of such outstanding convertible debt instruments in proportion to the convertible part thereof and (b) the equity shares reserved for the holders of fully or partially convertible debt instruments shall be issued at the time of conversion of such convertible debt instruments on the same terms on which the equity shares offered in the rights issue were issued.

A listed issuer who wants to raise funds through a rights issue shall announce a record date for the purpose of determining the shareholders eligible to apply for specified securities in the proposed rights issue. The issuer shall not withdraw rights issue after announcement of the record date. If the issuer withdraws the rights issue after announcing the record date, it shall not make an application for listing of any of its specified securities on any recognized stock exchange for a period of 12 months from the day on which the record date was announced. The issuer may seek listing of its equity shares allotted pursuant to conversion or exchange of convertible securities issued prior to the announcement of the record date, on the recognized stock exchange where its securities are listed.

Companies issue right shares by sending a letter of offer to the shareholders whose names are recorded in the books on a particular date. A shareholder has four options in case of rights. The first is to exercise his rights, *i.e.*, buy new shares at the offered price, second is to renounce his rights and sell them in the open market, third is to renounce part of his rights and exercise the remainder, and lastly, choose to do nothing. Thus, rights issue application form has three parts. Part A deals with application by the shareholders (including request for additional shares), Part B deals with form of renunciation to be filled in by the shareholders who desire to renounce their RE, and Part C deals with application by renouncee(s).
Also, shareholders can request for split application forms wherein they want to renounce only a part of their entitlement and want to apply for the rest of their entitlement or the shareholders want to renounce their entitlement in favour of more than one person.

Rights market has been a favoured capital mobilizing route for the corporate sector. However, this market shrunk from  $\overline{0}15,000$  crore a year to just about  $\overline{0}1,500$  crore. This was due to an absence of a trading platform for the post-issue trading of rights. Rights were traded through brokers by way of an over-the-counter market which does not lead to efficient price discovery. Hence, those shareholders who do not subscribe to their entire entitlement let the unsubscribed rights expire. In addition, the rights issue process was cumbersome wherein the issue has to be kept open for 30 days and the disclosure norms are stringent. In order to activate the rights market and to make the process cheaper and faster, the SEBI eased the disclosure norms relating to the rights issue. For rights issues, the issuer is required to give only the audited accounts of the last financial year and audited or unaudited financials with limited review results for the remaining period instead of five years' restated financials required earlier. Since rights are issued to shareholders who have already been receiving information about the company on a regular basis, the issuer need not give a summary of the industry and its business or information on its past performance or management. Disclosures that have been done away with include summary of the industry and business of the issuer company, promise vs. performance with respect to earlier/previous issues, management discussion, and analysis. The disclosures relating to financial statements, litigations, risk factors, etc. have been simplified.

In order to enable corporates to raise money faster, SEBI reduced the time line for approving a rights issue from 109 to 43 days. The reduction in timeline approved for rights issues include: the number of days for the notice period for a board meeting to be reduced from seven days to two working days; the notice period for record date to be reduced from 15/21/30 days to seven working days for all scrips; issue period to be reduced from minimum 30 days to a minimum of 15 days with a maximum of 30 days; and the time for completion of post-issue activity to be reduced from 42 days to 15 days. This will help the corporates to lower the risk due to an adverse change in market conditions and keep project costs under control.

In September 2008, the SEBI proposed trading in rights entitlements (RE) both electronically and physically through the stock exchange platform. Rights would be given a separate ISIN (code number for the security in a depository system) for it to trade on the exchange.

The proposed trading will work as follows:

### **(A) Electronic Rights Issue Process**

- 1. The issuer fixes a Record date to identify eligible shareholders. These shareholders would be entitled to subscribe to the proposed rights issue.
- 2. The issuer dispatches a letter to each shareholder informing that the rights entitlements have been credited into their respective demat accounts and duration of trading in RE and attaching the Letter of Offer and a Blank Application Form (unlike the present form which has shareholders' name and entitlement printed on it) to all the shareholders on the record date.
- 3. The blank application forms shall also be available with the stock exchanges, merchant bankers, and brokers. Further, soft copy of the same shall be available on the websites of the aforesaid intermediaries.
- 4. The Registrar, on the instruction of the issuer, shall through credit corporate action, credit the RE in the given ratio into the demat accounts of the eligible shareholders (as on record date).
- 5. The Rights issue shall thereafter open for (a) subscription; and (b) renunciation/trading of RE electronically through the stock exchange platform.
- 6. Trading will happen in REs on the secondary market platform of the stock exchanges as it happens in case of ordinary shares. To separate the trading of REs from the trading of ordinary shares, a separate ISIN shall be given for the REs.
- 7. Shareholders, who do not want to exercise their RE, can renounce their RE by selling their REs on the electronic trading platform of stock exchanges.
- 8. The shareholders who have not renounced their RE and the renouncees who don't want to renounce their RE further shall apply for shares against their RE during the issue period (which includes the trading period of RE) by submitting the application form received with the Letter of Offer/downloaded blank application form or by submitting the required information on a blank paper and submit the requisite payment instrument to Bankers to the issue.
- 9. Trading of RE may close at least three working days before closure of the rights issue so as to avoid last minute rush in submitting applications and to ensure that beneficial owner of REs have sufficient time to submit an application form. Once trading of REs closes, ISIN assigned to REs shall be suspended.

- 10. After the closure of trading and settlement of the trades done, the depositories shall make available the list of RE holders on the date the ISIN was suspended and the list of shareholders on the record date to the Registrar with their respective number of REs.
- 11. Thereafter, the Registrar shall reconcile the application by matching the number of shares applied for with number of RE available in the respective demat accounts based on the aforesaid list.
- 12. The registrar shall finalise the allotment and thereafter on the instruction of the issuer, credit the rights shares through a credit corporate action, to the respective demat accounts.
- 13. Thereafter, the Registrar shall through a corporate action debit the REs from the respective demat accounts for (a) shares allotted and (b) lapsed REs.

### **(B) Physical Rights Issue Process**

- 1. The issuer fixes a Record date to identify eligible shareholders. These shareholders would be entitled to subscribe to the proposed Rights Issue.
- 2. The issuer dispatches the Letter of Offer and Composite Application Form (CAF) with a preprinted unique no., name of the shareholder and his/her entitlement, to all the eligible shareholders on the record date.
- 3. The Rights issue shall thereafter open for (a) subscription and (b) renunciation/trading of RE physically.
- 4. The shareholders who have not renounced their RE and the renouncees shall apply for shares against their RE during the issue period (which includes the trading period of RE) by submitting the CAF or by submitting the required information on a blank paper and submit the requisite payment instrument to Bankers to the issue.
- 5. Trading of RE may close at least three working days before closure of the rights issue so as to avoid last minute rush in submitting applications and to ensure that beneficial owner of REs have sufficient time to submit an application form.
- 6. The Bankers to the Issue shall send the CAF/blank paper application to the Registrar.
- 7. Thereafter, the Registrar shall reconcile the application form as per the current practice.
- 8. The Registrar shall finalize the basis of allotment and send the physical share certificates to the shareholders.

The rights issues market made a come back after remaining dormant for over a decade. Companies find it easier to raise funds through rights issues when the primary market is in doldrums. Most of the rights issues were offered at a discount to the ruling market price. Hence, shareholders enthusiastically responded to the rights issues.

Besides the rights issue, several companies prefer private placement route to raise funds.

# **Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs)**

Just as Indian companies tap foreign capital markets to raise funds, similarly, foreign companies can now issue their shares to Indian nationals in India. To enable Indian investors to diversify risk and as a step towards integration of the Indian capital market with the international capital markets, foreign companies are allowed to access the Indian capital market by issuing Indian depository receipts (IDRs).

An IDR is an instrument denominated in Indian rupees in the form of a depository receipt against the underlying equity of issuing company to enable foreign companies to raise funds from the Indian capital market.

The Companies Act was amended in 2002 to permit foreign companies to offer shares in the form of depository receipts in India. However, the Department of Company Affairs (DCA) laid down the guidelines in February 2004. The salient features of the Companies (Issue of Indian Depository Receipts) Rules, 2004 are as follows:

- Only those companies registered overseas and having a pre-issue paid up capital and free reserves of at least USD 50 million and minimum average market capitalization of at least USD 100 million during the three financial years preceding the issue would be eligible to tap the Indian capital market.
- The issuing company should have made profits for atleast five years prior to the issue and a dividend record of not less than 10 per cent in those years. Also, the issuing company has to ensure that preissue debt equity ratio is not more than 2:1.
- The issuing company should be listed in its home country and not been prohibited to issue securities by any regulatory Body and has a good track record with respect to compliance with securities market regulations.

### **Indian Depository Receipts**

- Enable foreign companies to raise capital in India.
- Enable Indian investors to diversify risk.
- Enable globalization of Indian stock exchanges.

- Foreigners, resident or employed in India, subsidiaries of global corporations and foreign funds registered in India would also be eligible to invest in IDRs.
- The application would be required to be made atleast 90 days ahead of the opening of the issue in the format laid down along with a refundable fee of USD 10,000. On receiving the approval, an issue fee of 0.5 per cent subject to a minimum of  $\bar{\tau}10$  lakh would have to be paid for issues of upto  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore. Where the issue size exceeds  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore, a fee of 0.25 per cent, would be payable on an amount exceeding  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore.
- The repatriation of proceeds of the issue would be subject to the laws in force relating to export of foreign exchange.
- The IDRs shall not be redeemable into underlying equity shares for a period of one year from the date of issue. IDRs can be converted into the underlying equity shares only after the expiry of one year from the date of the issue of the IDR, subject to the compliance of the related provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act and Regulations issued there under by the RBI in this regard.
- The IDRs issued in a financial year can not exceed 15 per cent of the issuing company's paid-up capital and free reserves.
- The IDRs will have to be denominated in Indian rupees and will have to be listed on one or more stock exchanges.
- The issuer shall appoint an overseas custodian bank, with whom the underlying equity shares shall be deposited and a domestic depository which shall be authorized to issue the IDRs. For the issue of IDRs, a merchant banker should also be appointed. Overseas Custodian Bank is a banking company which is established in a country outside India and has a place of business in India and acts as custodian for the equity shares of issuing company against which IDRs are proposed to be issued. Domestic Depository is a custodian of securities registered with the SEBI and authorized by the issuing company to issue Indian Depository Receipts. It is also responsible to distribute dividend or other corporate action on the IDRs to the IDR holders in proportion to their holdings of IDRs. Merchant Banker registered with SEBI is responsible for due diligence and filing the draft prospectus with the SEBI.
- The draft prospectus shall be filed by the issuer with the ROC and the SEBI. Copies of certain documents as specified have to be filed. The SEBI may specify changes to be made in the offer document within a period of 21 days.
- Statement of variation of utilization of funds from the projected figures and the quarterly audited financial results shall be published in English language newspapers in India.
- On the receipt of dividends or other corporate action, the domestic depository shall distribute them proportionately among the IDR holders.
- IDRs will be listed on one or more recognized stock exchanges having nation-wide trading terminals in India and may be purchased, possessed, and freely transferred by persons resident in India as defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). IDRs can be transferred and redeemed, subject to the provisions of the FEMA.

The guidelines also clearly state that the IDR issuer would have to fulfil the eligibility criteria laid down by the SEBI and that it should obtain prior approval of the SEBI to make any issue.

The SEBI has prescribed its own set of norms which would also have to be adhered to by the IDR issuer.

**Eligibility for Issue of IDRs** No issuer shall make an issue IDRs unless

- 1. it fulfills the eligibility criteria as specified in Rule 4 of the IDR Rules;
- 2. it is listed in its home country;
- 3. it has not been prohibited to issue securities by any Regulatory Body; and
- 4. it has good track record with respect to compliance with securities market regulations.

### **Investors**

- 1. IDRs can be purchased by any person who is resident in India as defined under FEMA. NRIs and FIIs cannot purchase or possess IDRs unless special permission of the Reserve Bank of India is taken.
- 2. Investments by Indian Companies in IDRs shall not exceed the investment limits, if any, prescribed for them under applicable laws.
- 3. Automatic fungibility of IDRs is not permitted.

• The first ever issue of IDRs was by Standard Chartered Bank on May 28, 2010. Of 240 million IDRs sold, 36 million IDRs were placed with anchor investors. Each IDR represent one-tenth of Stan Chart's UK listed stock  $(10$ IDRs = 1 share).

- 4. In every issue of IDR:
  - a. At least 50 per cent of the IDRs issued shall be subscribed to by QIBs;
  - b. The balance 50 per cent shall be available for subscription by non-institutional investors (*i.e.*, investors other than QIBs and retail individual investors) and retail individual investors, including employees. IDRs shall be allocated among non-institutional investors, retail individual investors and employees at the discretion of the issuer. The manner of allocation shall be disclosed in the prospectus for IDRs.
- 5. The minimum application amount in an IDR issue shall be  $\overline{\tau}20,000/-$
- 6. Procedure to be followed by each class of applicant for applying shall be mentioned in the prospectus.

**Minimum Issue Size** The size of an IDR issue shall not be less than ₹50 crore.

**Minimum Subscription** If the company issuing the IDRs does not receive the minimum subscription of 90 per cent of the issued amount on the date of closure of the issue, or if the subscription level falls below 90 per cent after the closure of issue on account of cheques having being returned unpaid or withdrawal of applications, the company shall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If there is a delay beyond eight days after the company becomes liable to pay the amount, the company shall pay interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum for the period of delay.

The SEBI has extended the facility of anchor investors to issue of IDRs on similar terms as applicable to public issues made by domestic companies. Moreover, at least 30 per cent of issue size of the IDRs shall be reserved for allocation to retail individual investors, who may otherwise be crowded out. IDRs have not taken off so far.

# **Guidelines for Enabling Partial Two-Way Fungibility of Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs)**

In order to encourage more number of foreign companies to issue IDRs in the Indian market and also to enable the investors to take informed investment decision, SEBI provided a detailed roadmap and guidelines for the future IDR issuances as well as for the existing listed IDRs on March 1,2013.

- 1. All the IDRs shall have partial two-way fungibility. The partial two-way fungibility means that the IDRs can be converted into underlying equity shares and the underlying equity shares can be converted into IDRs within the available headroom. The headroom for this purpose shall be the number of IDRs originally issued minus the number of IDRs outstanding, which is further adjusted for IDRs redeemed into underlying equity shares ("Headroom")
- 2. The broad guidelines for fungibility of future IDR issuances and the existing listed IDRs are given below:

#### **I. Guidelines for Fungibility of Future IDR Issuance**

- i. IDRs shall not be redeemable into underlying equity shares before the expiry of one year period from the date of listing of IDRs.
- ii. After completion of one year period from the date of listing of IDRs, the issuer shall, provide two-way fungibility of IDRs.

- viii. Available Headroom and significant conversion/reconversion transactions shall be disclosed by the issuer on a continuous basis.
- ix. The issuer shall lay down the detailed procedures while taking into consideration the above broad guidelines in addition to other norms specified by SEBI and RBI, from time to time.

#### **II. Guidelines for Fungibility of Existing Listed IDRs**

- i. After completion of one year period from the date of issue of IDRs, the issuer shall, every year provide redemption/conversion of IDRs into underlying equity shares of the issuer of up to 25*per cent* of the IDRs originally issued.

- iv. The periodicity for IDR fungibility shall be at least once every quarter. The fungibility window shall remain open for the period of at least seven days. Provided that the option once exercised and disclosed by the issuer to public cannot be changed without the specific approval of SEBI. However, the issuer may decide to exercise the option provided in sub-clause (xiii), below, without specific approval from SEBI.
- v. Total number of IDRs available for fungibility during one fungibility window shall be fixed before the opening of the window. Re-issuances of IDRs during the fungibility window, if any, shall be considered for computation of Headroom only at the time of next cycle of fungibility. Fungibility window for this purpose shall mean the time period during which IDR holders can apply for conversion of IDRs into underlying equity shares.
- vi. In case of requests for conversion in excess of the limit available, the manner of accepting IDRs for conversion/redemption or shares for re-issuance shall be on proportionate basis.

Within this reserved window:

- in case of higher demand for fungibility. the demand shall be satisfied on proportionate basis. Further, the excess unsatisfied demand from the retail investors shall be included in the unreserved portion.
- in case of lower demand for fungibility from retail investors, the unallocated portion shall be added to the unreserved portion.
- viii. All the IDRs applied for fungibility shall be transferred to IDR redemption account at the time of application and in case of unsuccessful bids the balance IDRs shall be transferred back to the account of applicant.

- xiii. The existing issuer of IDR may exercise the option of using the guidelines available for the new issuers as referred above from the anniversary of the date of listing of their IDRs after the issuance of this circular or from any of the subsequent quarters thereafter. For this purpose, the issuer shall disclose the exercising of the said option by giving advertisements in leading English and Hindi national daily newspapers with wide circulation as well as notification to the stock exchanges giving the operating guidelines for redemption/conversion of IDRs at least one month before exercising the option. The said option, once exercised, cannot be reversed.
- xiv. The issuer shall lay down the detailed procedures while taking into consideration the above broad guidelines in addition to other norms specified by SEBI and RBI, from time to time.

### **Regulatory Framework for Rights Issues of Indian Depository Receipts**

In order to facilitate simultaneous rights offering by the foreign issuers (who have listed their IDRs in Indian stock exchanges) in their home jurisdiction and in India, framework for rights issue of IDRs was notified. To simplify the requirements, it was mandated that for circulation in India, an ad ditional wrap (disclosing information required in Indian jurisdiction and issue process relevant for the IDR holders) can be attached with the letter of offer circulated in their home jurisdiction by the overseas investor. Disclosure requirements for IDR rights issue were also made more or less in line with the reduced disclosure requirements applicable for domestic rights issues. Further, IDR issuers, who were in compliance with the continuous listing requirements, were provided with the facility of filing the offer document on fast track basis.

# **Facilitating Capital Raising by Start-Ups**

The platform shall now be called **Institutional Trading Platform (ITP)** and shall facilitate capital raising as well.

The salient features of the new framework to facilitate capital raising by start-ups are:

- i. The said platform is accessible to:
  - a. companies which are intensive in their use of technology, information technology, intellectual property, data analytics, biotechnology and nanotechnology to provide products, services or business platforms with substantial value addition and with at least 25 per cent of the pre-issue capital being held by QIBs or
- b. any other company in which at least 50 per cent of the pre-issue capital is held by QIBs.
- ii. No person (individually or collectively with persons acting in concert) in such a company shall hold 25 per cent or more of the post-issue share capital.
- iii. Disclosure requirements have been rationalized for companies raising funds on this platform. Considering the nature of the business of a company which may list on the said platform, disclosures may contain only the broad objects of the issue and there will be no cap on the amount raised for general corporate purposes as applicable for the companies listed on the main board. Further, lock-in requirements of the entire pre-issue capital will be for a much shorter period of only six months from the date of allotment uniformly for all the shareholders, subject to certain exemptions to ensure liquidity.
- iv. As standard valuation parameters such as P/E, EPS may not be relevant in the case of many such companies, the basis of issue price may include other disclosures (except projections) as deemed fit by the issuers.
- v. Only two categories of investors can access the proposed  $ITP (i)$  Institutional investors (QIBs, along with family trusts, systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI and intermediaries registered with SEBI, each with a networth of more than  $\overline{500}$  crore) and (ii) Non-institutional Investors (NIIs) other than retail individual investors.
- vi. In case of a public offer, allotment to institutional investors may be on a discretionary basis whereas to NIIs, it will be on a proportionate basis. Allocation between the two categories will be in the ratio of 75 and 25 per cent, respectively.

- vii. In case of discretionary allotment to institutional investors, no institutional investor will be allotted more than 10 per cent of the issue size. All shares allotted on a discretionary basis will be locked-in, in line with the requirement for lock-in in the case of the anchor investors, that is, for 30 days.
- viii. The minimum application size in case of such issues will be  $\bar{\tau}$ lakh and the minimum trading lot will also be of the same amount.
- ix. The number of allottees in case of a public offer will be more than 200.
- x. The company will have the option to migrate to the main board after three years subject to compliance with the eligibility requirements of the stock exchanges.
- xi. For Category I and II AIFs, which are required under the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 to invest a certain minimum amount in unlisted securities, investments in shares of companies listed on this platform may be treated as investments in 'unlisted securities' for the purpose of calculating investment limits.
- xii. The same platform will also facilitate capital raising by SMEs.

# **Private Placement Market**

In the primary capital market, corporates can raise resources through public issues, rights issues, and private placement. In the case of public issues, securities are allotted to the general public. In the case of rights issues, securities are allotted to the existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. In contrast, private placement refers to the direct sale of newly issued securities by the issuer to a small number of investors through merchant bankers. These investors are selected clients such as financial institutions, corporates, banks, and high net worth individuals.

# **Private Placements of Securities by Companies**

Some companies misused the private placement route by issuing huge number of debt securities to public under the garb of private placements, Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, have put some restrictions on private placements, which was previously lightly regulated.

As per Chapter III, The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 , in case of a private placement of securities, private placement offer or invitation cannot be made to more than 200 persons in the aggregate in a financial year (excluding qualified institutional buyers and employees of the company being offered securities under a scheme of employees stock option).

Such offer can be made only to such persons whose names are recorded by the company prior to the invitation to subscribe, and that such persons shall receive the offer by name, and that a complete record of such offers shall be kept by the company and complete information about such offer shall be filed with the registrar within a period of thirty days of circulation of relevant private placement offer letter.

All monies payable towards subscription of securities through private placement shall be paid through cheque or demand draft or other banking channels but not by cash. Further, rules require that the payment to be made for subscription to securities shall be made from the bank account of the person subscribing to such securities and the company shall keep a record of all such bank accounts. The company shall allot its securities within sixty days from the date of receipt of the application money for private placement, else money has to be repaid to the investors.

Company offering securities through private placement shall not release any public advertisements or utilize any media, marketing or distribution channels or agents to inform the public at large about such an offer.

Ministry of Corporate Affairs has also notified Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014. As per the said rules, a private placement offer letter shall be accompanied by an application form serially numbered and addressed specifically to the person to whom the offer is made and no person other than the person so addressed in the application form shall be allowed to apply through such application form. The value of such offer or invitation per person shall be with an investment size of not less than  $\overline{*}20,000$  of face value of the securities.

A return of allotment of securities shall be filed with Registrar of Companies within 30 days of allotment along with a complete list of all security holders containing the full name, address, permanent account number and e-mail Id of such security holder.

Companies Act, 2013 mentions that any offer or invitation that is not in compliance with the provisions of Section 42 shall be treated as a public offer and all provisions of Companies Act, 2013, and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 shall be required to be complied with, including the above mentioned requirements.

• Private placement refers to the direct sale of newly issued securities by the issuer to a small number of investors through merchant bankers. The number of investors can go only up to 49.

However, as mentioned above, Companies Act, 2013 provides a window for making private placement offers to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and the' limit of 200' is not applicable to such QIBs. QIBs are the entities such as a MF, Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI), AIF, Scheduled Commercial Bank, IRDA registered Insurance company, etc., as defined in SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009.

The private placement route offers several advantages to the issuer for raising resources. The time taken by as well as the cost of issue for the private placement route is much less for the issuer as compared to the public and rights issues. Privately placed issues can be tailor-made to suit the requirements of both the issuer and the investor to give them greater flexibility than public or rights issues. Moreover, private placement does not require detailed compliance of formalities, rating, and disclosure norms as required in public or rights issues. These advantages make the market quite popular in the USA where generally, debt instruments are privately placed.

Available data indicates that private placement has become the preferred route for raising resources by both private and public sector companies. In India, this route has gained immense importance during the last few years, in view of the prolonged subdued conditions in the new issues market.

In terms of instruments, debt instruments, mainly bonds and debentures of different maturities, were preferred the most. The equity portion was raised in the form of preference shares.

The factors that led to private placement becoming a favoured route for Indian corporates and financial institutions are as follows:

- The prolonged subdued conditions in the primary market since 1995–96.
- Private placements in India were not bound by any regulatory system till September 2003.
- Private placements have no lock-in period except when it is in favour of promoters.
- There is no compliance system for merchant bankers in private placement as in the case of public issues.
- The limit on a bank's investment on debt has been removed which has made this market more buoyant.
- Through private placements, issuing banks can raise their Tier II capital in order to prop up the capital adequacy ratio.
- Many corporate issuers of debt are defaulters with the subscribing banks and financial institutions. These banks and financial institutions subscribe to a fresh issue and the proceeds from this issue are used to repay the interest and principal of term loans so that the issuing company is not classified as a non-performing asset in the books.
- Benefits of operational flexibility and attractive pricing.
- The private sector taps this market to raise funds for the retirement of old expensive debt or acquisitions.
- Short-term debentures and non-convertible debentures are more popular with issuers and investors in this market.

The major issuers of privately placed securities are financial institutions, banks, and central- and state-level undertakings. The subscribers are banks, provident funds, mutual funds, and high net worth individuals.

In India, privately placed securities are admitted for trading, but are not listed. Banks do not trade these securities and hold them till maturity. Hence, there is no secondary market for such securities. There is not much depth in the market as the number of investors is quite low.

In the US, the private placement market is an important source of long-term funds for corporates. Only qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) are allowed to trade in private debt and this has increased the liquidity of private placements.

Banks and institutions have over  $\overline{51,00,000}$  crore worth of exposure in the private placement market. The Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks and financial institutions for investment in such cases. These guidelines are, however, not applicable to privately placed issues with less than 50 members. Issuers avoid these guidelines by tying up with less than 50 members. Hence, the capital market regulator, the SEBI, prescribed stringent disclosure norms on September 30, 2003 for this segment, which had remained almost unregulated until then. On account of this, resource mobilization from this market declined in 2003–04.

Private placements are now regulated. Companies wanting to list their privately placed bonds have to make disclosures as per the Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines. Further, they will have to comply with the listing agreement of stock exchanges. For privately placed debt in standard denominations of  $\bar{\tau}10$ lakh, such disclosures have to be made through the company and stock exchange websites. Credit rating is compulsory for privately placed debt issues. At least an investment-grade rating is needed for listing. All such issuances must have a debenture redemption trustee and a reserve that may be governed by the SEBI's debenture trust rule. The company shall appoint a SEBI-registered debenture trustee. Securities should be

issued and traded in demat form. All trades, with the exception of spot transactions in a listed debt security shall be executed only on the trading platforms of a stock exchange. Secondary market is restricted to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and high net worth individuals. If an issuer is unwilling to list the paper, no SEBI-registered merchant banker can be involved in the issue. The Reserve Bank of India also has barred financial institutions (FIs) from investing in unrated papers and papers rated below investment grade. The RBI has placed a 20 per cent ceiling on investment in unlisted securities and securitized paper. Within this 20 per cent limit, it has placed a ceiling of 10 per cent on FI investment in unlisted papers. FIs have to follow the guidelines issued by the SEBI on raising resources through the private placement market. Further, FIs have to disclose the details on the issuer composition of investment made through private placement and non-performing investments in the balance sheet from the fiscal year 2003–04. The RBI norms have also put a cap on banks' investment in unrated debt at 10 per cent of their investments.

# **Preferential Issue**

A public/rights issue is cumbersome and requires compliance with statutory provisions. Hence, many companies opt for preferential allotment of shares for raising funds. Such allotments are made to various strategic groups including promoters, foreign partners, technical collaborators, and private equity funds. Companies need to seek approval from shareholders for preferential allotment of shares. An issuer need not file an offer document in case of preferential allotment.

A preferential issue is an issue of shares or of convertible securities by listed companies to a select group of persons under Section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956. The issuer company has to comply with the Companies Act and the requirements contained in the chapter pertaining to preferential allotment in the SEBI (ICDR) Regulations which inter-alia include pricing and other requirements.

The SEBI (ICDR) Regulations define 'preferential issue' as an issue of specified securities by a listed issuer to any select person or group of persons on a private placement basis and does not include an offer of specified securities made through a public issue, rights issue, bonus issue, employee stock option scheme, employee stock purchase scheme or qualified institutions placement or an issue of sweat equity shares or depository receipts issued in a country outside India or foreign securities;

The promoter has been defined as a person or persons who are in overall control of the company; who are instrumental in the formulation of a plan or programme pursuant to which the securities are offered to the public and those named in the prospectus as promoter(s); Provided that a director or officer of the issuer or a person, if acting as such merely in his professional capacity, shall not be deemed as a promoter. Provided further that a financial institution, scheduled bank, foreign institutional investor, and mutual fund shall not be deemed to be a promoter merely by virtue of the fact that 10 per cent or more of the equity share capital of the issuer is held by such person; Provided further that such financial institution, scheduled bank and foreign institutional investor shall be treated as promoter for the subsidiaries or companies promoted by them or for the mutual fund sponsored by them;

- Lock-in indicates a freeze on the shares and it is stipulated to ensure that the promoters continue to hold some minimum percentage of shares in the company.

#### **Box 6.2** Preferential Allotments

The preferential allotment route has been grossly misused by both MNCs and Indian companies. Twenty-nine MNCs had exercised the aforesaid provisions of preferential share in favour of their promoters during 1991–94. Two cases of the lowest throw-away prices at which shares were offered to their promoters were at ₹60 and ₹110 against the market price of ₹700 and ₹1,050 respectively. Nine Indian companies similarly allotted preferential shares to their promoters during 1993–94. The lowest price at which one company allotted the share was ₹22 against the market price of ₹400. Total unlawful gains made by the promoters ran into more than ₹2,996.56 crore for MNCs and ₹846 crore for Indian companies.

or firm in which the aggregate share of the promoter and his immediate relatives is equal to or more than 10 per cent of the total, and all persons whose shareholding is aggregated for the purpose of disclosing in the prospectus shareholding of the promoter group. Provided that a financial institution, scheduled bank, foreign institutional investor, and mutual fund shall not be deemed to be promoter group merely by virtue of the fact that 10 per cent or more of the equity share capital of the issuer is held by such person: Provided further that such financial institution, scheduled bank, and foreign institutional investor shall be treated as promoter group for the subsidiaries or companies promoted by them or for the mutual fund sponsored by them;

A company can make preferential issue of equity shares, warrants, partly convertible debentures (PCDs), fully convertible debentures (FCDs), or any other financial instruments convertible into or exchanged with equity shares at a later date. A listed company is permitted to make a preferential issue only if its entire shareholding is held in dematerialized form. In case of preferential issues, the entire prepreferential allotment shareholding should be under lock-in. The lock-in period shall commence from the relevant date upto a period of six months from the date of preferential allotment. The shareholders who have sold their shares during the six months period prior to the relevant period would not be eligible for allotment of shares on a preferential basis.

The SEBI has issued norms for preferential allotment which are as follows:

- The total preferential investments issued to promoters is to be locked in for three years. The lock-in period of shares allotted on conversion of warrants shall start when shares are allotted and not when warrants are allotted.
  - The upfront margin to be paid by allottees of warrants has been raised to 25 per cent from 10 per cent. This is expected to discourage promoters from issuing warrants to themselves at a discount in a bull run and then do not honour their commitments if the stock prices fall.
- The details of the amount utilized out of preferential issue proceeds are to be disclosed under an appropriate head in the balance sheet of the company, indicating the purpose for which such money has been utilized. Even the details of the unutilized money are also to be disclosed in the balance sheet under a separate head indicating the form in which such unutilized money has been invested.
- Preferential allotment should be at a price not less than the higher of the following: The average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the scrip quoted on a stock exchange during the six months preceding the date of general meeting or the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the scrip quoted on a stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the date of general meeting.
- Where the equity shares of a company have been listed on a stock exchange for a period of less than six months as on the relevant date; the issue of shares on preferential basis can be made at a price not less than higher of the following: The price at which shares were issued by the company in its IPO or the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on the stock exchange during the period shares have been listed preceding the relevant date or during the two weeks preceding the relevant date provided that on completing a period of six months of being listed on a stock exchange, the company shall recompute the price of the share in accordance with the provisions mentioned above and if the price at which shares were allotted on a preferential basis under this clause was lower than the price so computed, the difference shall be paid by the allottees to the company. The preferential allotment guidelines were amended to enable companies with listing history of less than six months also to raise money through preferential allotment, subject to complying with the modified pricing and disclosure norms.
- Relevant date in the case of preferential issue of equity shares is provided as 'thirty days prior to the date on which meeting of shareholders is held to consider the proposed preferential issue'. The avoid interpretational issues, the amendment has provided that in case the relevant date falls on a weekend/ holiday, the day preceding the weekend/holiday would be reckoned to be the relevant date, Also for purpose of uniformity, the reference to time period in terms of 'months' has been modified to 'weeks'.

Further, the listed companies intending to make preferential allotment would be required to obtain PAN from each applicant before making the allotment. Debt restructuring framework should commence from the date of allotment and continue for a period of one year. In case of partly paid-up shares, the lock-in period should commence from the date of allotment and continue for a period of one year from the date when shares become fully paid-up.

Preferential allotment is carried out for various reasons: to enhance the promoters' holding by issuing share warrants to themselves; as part of debt restructuring/conversion of loans; for the purpose of strategic investments by institutional/foreign investors; to issue shares by way of Employees Stock Option Plans (ESOPs); for fresh issue to shareholders other than promoters and for take-over of company by management group.

Companies use the preferential allotment route to raise working capital. Besides, the company can choose among the varied types of investors for its preferential issue. Institutional investors like private equity funds

#### **Preference for Preferential Issues**

- To enhance holding of promoters.
- Can be pledged with banks.
- Easier Norms.
- Low cost.
- Management control to institutional investors.

### **Promoters Pledge their Holdings**

- To release their earlier pledged holdings.
- To cash in on the bull run.
- To finance their private transactions, or
- As a collateral for their companies' borrowings.
prefer preferential issue route as it enables management control in the issuing company and the lock-in period is only one year. One of the reasons why companies prefer to allot preferential shares to their promoters is that they can be pledged with banks either to release their earlier holdings which are not under lock-in or to release fresh funds to cash in on the bull run. The preferential allotment route is preferred in bullish market.

Preferential issues enable quick fund raising at low cost and allow a company to take on board its business partners like technology collaborators, to raise their commitment to the company. Moreover, increase in investments by promoters and institutional investors boosts the confidence of retail investors However, it increases the equity base of a company which leads to a decline in the earnings per share. Since the beneficiaries are promoters or outsiders, the relative holding of existing shareholders declines. Hence, it is an inequitable way of raising funds. In most cases, promoters are allotted additional shares at times when the company may not be in need of funds. This adversely affects the valuation ratios and brings down the stock prices thereby affecting the interests of existing shareholders.

# **Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP)**

It has emerged as a new fund raising investment for listed companies in India. QIP is an issue of equity shares or securities convertible into equity shares by a listed company to qualified institutional buyers only, in terms of provisions of Chapter XIIIA of SEBI(DIP) guidelines. Through a QIP issue, funds can be raised from foreign as well as domestic institutional investors without getting listed on a foreign exchange, which is a lengthy and cumbersome affair. Also, unlike a private placement, there is no lock-in clause. The issue process is not only simple but can be completed speedily since the company issues equity shares and does not create a derivative investment as is the case with GDR/ADR. Investors also gain since they invest directly in equity shares and do not have to bear the cost of holding and converting depository receipts. Unlike GDRs, a QIP issue can be offered to a wider set of investors including Indian mutual funds, banks and insurance companies, as well as, foreign institutional investors. As there is no new stock exchange listing, the issue is free from the hassles of continuing disclosures and administrative costs.

SEBI issued guidelines for Qualified Institutions Placement on May 8, 2006. Key features of the same are:

**Issuer** A company whose equity shares are listed on a stock exchange having nation-wide trading terminals for a period of atleast one year and which is complying with the prescribed requirements of minimum public shareholding of the listing agreements will be eligible to raise funds in domestic market by placing securities with Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB).

**Securities** Securities which can be issued through QIP are equity shares, or any securities other than warrants, which are convertible into or exchangeable with equity shares. A security, which is convertible or exchanged into equity shares at any time, after allotment of security but not later than sixty months from the date of allotment can be issued. The specified securities shall be made fully paid up at the time of allotment.

**Investors/Allottees** The specified securities can be issued only to QIBs, as defined under subclause (v) of Clause 2.2.2 B of the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines. Such QIBs shall not be promoters or related to promoters of the issuer, either directly or indirectly. Each placement of the specified securities issued through QIB shall be on private placement basis, in compliance with the requirements of the first provision to clause (a) of Sub-section (3) of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. A minimum of 10 per cent of the securities in each placement shall be allotted to Mutual Funds. For each placement, there shall be atleast two allottees for an issue of size upto  $Z_{250}$  crores and at least five allottees for an issue size in excess of `250 crore. Further, no single allottee shall be allotted in excess of 50 per cent of the issue size. Investors shall not be allowed to withdraw their bids/applications after closure of the issue.

Issue Size The aggregate funds that can be raised through QIPs in one financial year shall not exceed five times of the networth of the issuer at the end of its previous financial year.

- Qualified Institutions Placement is a private placement of equity shares or convertible securities by a listed company to Qualified Institutions Buyers.
- The issuing company is required to allot atleast 10 per cent of the total issue to mutual funds.

#### **Box 6.3** Private Equity (PE)

Private equity investments have increased in India. In 2006, over USD 7 bn were invested by PE firms in India. Private equity is a long-term equity investment by a fund in private and public (listed) firms with successful business models and a potential for a higher growth. Private equity plays an important role in the growth of enterprises. It helps the investee companies in promoting their growth by providing capital knowledge and skills. It also helps in formulating and shaping the corporate strategy of investee firms and improving their corporate governance. Some PE firms such as Warbury Pincus Investments, GW Capital Investment, and GA Partners Investment have invested in highly successful companies like Bharti, Spectramind, ICICI ventures, Biocon, Patni Computers, and many others.

Placement Document Issuer shall prepare a placement document containing all the relevant and material disclosures. There will be no pre-issue filing of the placement document with SEBI. The placement documents will be placed on the websites of the stock exchanges and the issuer.

Pricing The floor price of the specified securities shall be determined on a basis similar to that for GDR/ FCCB issues and shall be subject to adjustment in case of corporate actions such as stock splits, rights issues, bonus issue, etc. The floor price for QIPs is based on two weeks average with the relevant date being the day on which the board meets to take the decision to open the QIP. A maximum discount of 5 per cent has been permitted to the price calculated subject to approval by shareholders.

**Other Procedural Requirements** The resolution approving QIP, passed under Sub-section (1 A) of Section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other applicable provision, will remain valid for a period of 12 months from the date of passing of the resolution. There shall be a gap of at least six months between each placement in case of multiple placements of specified securities pursuant to authority of the same shareholders' resolution. Issuer and Merchant Banker shall submit documents/undertakings, if any, specified in this regard in the listing agreement, for the purpose of seeking in-principle approval and final permission from Stock Exchanges for listing of the specified securities.

# **INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENT PROGRAMME**

With a view to enabling listed entities to meet the minimum public shareholding requirements (10 per cent for PSU and 25 per cent for non-PSUs) under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, the Institutional Placement Programme (IPP) has been introduced.

## **Resource Mobilization From International Markets**

As mentioned earlier, funds can be raised in the primary market from the domestic market as well as from international markets. After the reforms were initiated in 1991, one of the major policy changes was allowing Indian companies to raise resources by way of equity issues in the international markets. Earlier, only debt was allowed to be raised from international markets. In the early 1990s, foreign exchange reserves had depleted and the country's rating had been downgraded. This resulted in a foreign exchange crunch and the government was unable to meet the import requirements of Indian companies. Hence, allowing companies to tap the equity and bond market in Europe seemed a more sensible option. This permission encouraged Indian companies to become global.

Indian companies have raised resources from international capital markets through Global Depository Receipts (GDRs)/American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs), and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). The last are used as a residual source, after exhausting external equity as a main source of finance for large value projects.

# **Factors Leading to an Increase in the Popularity of International Markets**

Since 1993, many of the firms have chosen to use the offshore primary market instead of the domestic primary market for raising resources. The factors that can be attributed to this behaviour are as follows:

• GDRs are listed on the European stock exchanges or on the Asian stock exchanges. such as the Dubai and Singapore stock exchanges.

- The time involved in the entire public issue on the offshore primary market is shorter and the issue costs are also low as the book building procedure is adopted.
- Offshore issues allow foreign ownership to cross the ceiling.
- Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) prefer Euro issues as they do not have to register with the SEBI nor do they have to pay any capital gains tax on GDRs traded in the foreign exchanges. Moreover, arbitrage opportunities exist as GDRs are priced at a discount compared with their domestic price.
- Indian companies can collect a larger volume of funds in foreign exchange from international markets than through domestic markets.
- The increasing popularity of Euro bonds market among international borrowers. Euro bonds are underwritten by an international syndicate of banks and placed in countries other than the one in whose currency the bond is denominated. There are no regulatory restrictions as they fall outside the purview of any single country's regulatory framework. Moreover, they are not subject to stringent disclosure norms as compared to dollar denominated bonds in the US.
- The projections of the GDP growth are very strong and consistent which have created a strong appetite for Indian paper in the overseas market.
- An overseas issuance allows the company to get exposure to international investors, thereby, increasing the visibility of Indian companies in the overseas market.

The investors in international markets are hedge funds, long equity funds, and self-managed pension funds. Indian firms can raise long-term funds from the international markets through equity instruments such as GDRs/ADRs or through FCCBs—a debt instrument convertible into equity on a future date. Longterm loans raised from the international markets are known as External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

# **Global Depository Receipts (GDRs)**

GDRs are essentially equity instruments issued abroad by authorized overseas corporate bodies against the shares/bonds of Indian companies held with nominated domestic custodian banks. An Indian company intending to issue GDRs will issue the corresponding number of shares to an overseas depository bank. Thus, the issue of GDR creates equity shares of the issuing company which are kept with a designated bank. GDRs are freely transferable outside India and dividend in respect of the share represented by the GDR is paid in Indian rupees only. They are listed and traded on a foreign stock exchange. Trading takes place between professional market makers on an OTC (over the counter) basis. A GDR may represent one or more shares of the issuing company. The shares correspond to the GDR in a fixed ratio. GDRs are fungible, which means the holder of GDRS can instruct the depository to convert them into underlying shares and sell them in the domestic market. A holder of a GDR can, at any time, convert it into the number of shares that it represents. Till conversion, the GDRs do not carry any voting rights and once conversion takes place, the underlying shares are listed and traded on the domestic exchange. Now the GDR holders can instruct their depository to vote on their behalf.

Most of the Indian companies have their GDR issues listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. Indian GDRs are primarily sold to institutional investors and the major demand is in the UK, US, Hongkong, Singapore, France, and Switzerland. Rule 144A of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US permits companies from outside the US to offer their GDRs to qualified institutional buyers.

## **American Depository Receipts (ADRs)**

ADRs are negotiable instruments, denominated in dollars, and issued by the US Depository Bank. A non-US company that seeks to list in the US, deposits its shares with a bank and receives a receipt which enables the company to issue American Depository Shares (ADSs). These ADSs serve as stock certificates and are used interchangeably with ADRs which represent ownership of deposited shares. There is no legal or technical difference between an ADR and a GDR. As they are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Association), ADR issues offer access to the US institutional and retail markets while GDR issues offer access only to the US institutional market. ADR listing requires comprehensive disclosures and greater transparency as compared to a GDR listing.

GDRs can be converted into ADRs by surrendering the existing GDRs and depositing the underlying equity shares with the ADR depository in exchange for ADRs. The company has to comply with the SEC

## **Process for Issuing Sponsored ADR/GDR by an Indian Company**

- Board Approval
- Tendering of the shares by the shareholders.
- Conversion to ADRs/ GDRs.
- Sale of ADRs/GDRs to overseas investors.
- Repatriation of proceeds to India within one month.
- Distribution of proceeds to the shareholders.

#### **Box 6.4** Sponsored ADS Issues

In a sponsored ADS issue, a company's shareholders submit their domestic shares to the company which are then issued to foreign investors in the form of ADSs. The shares submitted for the sponsored ADS issue are extinguished and replaced with ADRs. A sponsored ADS issue is different from the regular ADS issue. When companies issue sponsored ADS, there is no new issue of equity shares. Indian investors, promoters, or FIIs can tender their shares when a company announces an ADR issue and the allotment is done proportionately. Companies which have large amounts of cash and a high percentage of floating stock (shares owned by non-promoters), issue sponsored ADS to increase their visibility in territories where their products are sold.

ICICI Bank converted 38.4 million equity shares (5.2 per cent of its equity) into American Depository Shares (ADSs) at USD 12.11 each at a premium of 18 per cent to the closing domestic price on March 11, 2005. ICICI Bank was the first bank to go in for a sponsored ADS issue.

Infosys Technologies, India's second largest software services firm, offered in May 2005, ADS conversion (conversion of existing shares into US-listed stock) at USD-67 per ADS (American Depository Shares). This sponsored secondary offering consisted of 14 million ADSs representing 14 million equity shares with a green-shoe option of 2 million shares. Infosys offered this conversion to boost the size of US float to about 14 per cent of its capital and also to give domestic investors an opportunity to reap the big premium on the NASDAQ. Of the 16 million shares on offer, 20 per cent (3.2 million) shares were allotted to the Japanese market through a public offer without listing (POWL). This wasthe first POWL issue by any Indian company. POWL means offering the Infosysstock without an official listing procedure to Japanese institutions and retail investors.

requirements to materialize this exchange offer process. However, the company does not get any funds by this conversion. The trend is towards the conversion of GDRs into ADRs as ADRs are more liquid and cover a wider market.

ADRs are accessible to only good companies with high transparency and good governance practices which also benefit the local investor; this gets reflected in a higher P/E ratio. Companies are attracted towards raising ADRs as they are free to decide the deployment of funds either in the US or in India. Companies can also make their presence felt in the global arena which would result in increased liquidity of the company's stock. This would also further broaden the mergers and amalgamations financing capabilities of the company. Moreover, an ADR issue creates a currency for issue of dollar-denominated stock option to employees, thereby enabling the company to hire and retain the best human resources. A considerable amount of resources has been raised from the international capital market through GDRs/ADRs.

Good companies through good corporate practices and governance have been successful in getting themselves listed on the LSE, the NASDAQ, and the NYSE. There are 12 Indian companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and two on NYSE Euronext. The US government has made listing norms more stringent in the wake of a recent spate of accounting scandals. With the introduction of stringent Sarbanes Oxley Act in the US, many Indian companies have found it difficult to raise funds through ADRs. Many small and mid-size Indian companies opted to raise funds at the Alternate Investment Market (AIM) at London. Firms listed at AIM can trade on other global exchanges. Satyam Computers went for a cross-listing in early 2008 by joining NYSE Euronext besides NYSE.

# **Organizing Euro Issues**

The Euro issues market comprises GDRs/ADRs and FCCBs. Both FCCBs and FCEBs being debt instruments are covered under ECBs. A company which wants to tap international markets for raising resources has to prepare its accounts for the last three to five years in a revised format according to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) prevalent either in the UK or US for the GDR/ADR issue. The company has to appoint a merchant banker for organizing the Euro issue. The merchant banker occupies a pivotal place as he formulates the marketing strategy, designs the issue structure, and arranges syndicate members, underwriters, and a team of intermediaries. After finalizing the offer document, he conducts road shows wherein interviews with the fund managers and potential investors are held and there is widespread distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and reports of the issuing company. These road shows help in knowing the investor response to the issue. The issue price is based on this response and the price of the securities on the domestic stock exchange. The issue price is decided a few hours before the opening of the issue. In the initial years, Indian GDRs were priced at a discount over the prevailing domestic price. The phenomenon of pricing at a discount ended in November 1993 when Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) placed its GDR at par with the domestic price.

## **Guidelines Relating to International Issues**

ADRs/GDRs are considered to be a part of foreign direct investment (FDI). Therefore, such issues would need to conform to the existing FDI policy and only in areas where FDI is permissible. Indian companies raising money from ADRs/GDRs through registered exchanges are now free to access the ADR/GDR markets automatically, without the prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. Prior permission from the Government of India is essential for the issue of FCCBs. A company seeking to raise funds abroad through these instruments should have a consistently good track record of at least three years. The foreign equity participation directly or indirectly is restricted to 51 per cent of the issued and subscribed capital of a company.

Banks, financial institutions, and registered non-bank financial institutions were made eligible for Euro issues in June 1996 subject to the condition that the proceeds from such issues would not be invested in stock market and real estate. There is no restriction now on the number of Euro issues floated in a year by a company or a group of companies.

The end use of the GDR proceeds and external commercial borrowings have been prescribed and modified from time to time. As GDRs/ADRs are full risk equity, end-use restrictions on GDR/ ADR issue proceeds have been removed. The proceeds so raised have to be kept abroad till actually required in India. Pending repatriation or utilization of the proceeds, the Indian company can invest the funds in:

- 1. Deposits with or Certificate of Deposit or other instruments offered by banks who have been rated by Standard and Poor, Fitch, IBCA or Moody's, etc. and such rating not being less than the rating stipulated by Reserve Bank from time to time for the purpose (current rating applicable is AA(-) by Standard and Poor/Fitch IBCA or Aa3 by Moody's);
- 2. Deposits with branch/es of Indian Authorized Dealers (ADs) outside India; and
- 3. Treasury bills and other monetary instruments with a maturity or unexpired maturity of one year or less.

Indian companies are free to utilize, without any prior approval, 100 per cent of the proceeds for overseas investment.

The ADR/GDR proceeds can be utilized for first stage acquisition of shares in the disinvestment process of Public Sector Undertakings/Enterprises and also in the mandatory second stage offer to the public in view of their strategic importance. Voting rights on shares issued under the scheme shall be as per the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and in a manner in which restrictions on voting rights imposed on ADR/GDR issues shall be consistent with the Company Law provisions. RBI regulations regarding voting rights in the case of banking companies will be applicable to all shareholders exercising voting rights.

In his budget speech 1998–99, the finance minister announced a special stock option scheme for Indian software companies linked with ADR/GDR offerings to enable them to provide incentive to retain their highly skilled professionals.

In March 2001, the government allowed two-way fungibility for Indian GDRs/ADRs by which converted local shares could be reconverted into GDRs/ADRs subject to sectoral caps. Under this scheme, a stock broker in India, registered with SEBI, can purchase shares of an Indian company from the market for conversion into ADRs/GDRs based on instructions received from overseas investors. Re-issuance of ADRs/GDRs would be permitted to the extent of ADRs/GDRs which have been redeemed into underlying shares and sold in the Indian market.

With this, the reverse fungibility of ADRs and GDRs has gathered momentum. With the reconversions, there was no headroom in case of the ICICI bank's counter in September 2002. Headroom denotes the number of domestic shares which are available for reconversion into ADRs or GDRs.

Funds raised through FCCBs can be used for restructuring of external debt and not more than 25 per cent of the FCCB issue proceeds may be used for general corporate restructuring, including working capital requirements. Unlisted companies are barred from issuing shares or debt overseas through FCCBs, without a prior or simultaneous listing in the domestic stock markets.

Listed companies not eligible to raise funds from the domestic capital markets, including those restrained by the SEBI, will not be eligible to issue FCCBs or GDRs. Similarly, overseas corporate bodies (OCBs), which are debarred from investing through the portfolio route and those entities prohibited from dealing in securities by the SEBI are barred from investing in FCCBs and GDRs. Companies which have already issued GDRs, ADRs, or FCCBs will now have to get themselves listed in the domestic market within three years of issue. These measures were aimed at bringing the ADR/GDR guidelines 'in alignment' with the SEBI's guidelines on domestic capital issues and to put a quality check on the burgeoning number of FCCB issues. Accordingly, GDR and FCCB issues would now have to correspond to share prices of similar companies quoted in the Indian Stock Markets. This would block companies from tapping markets abroad, at discounted prices to the local price level. The pricing of GDR/ADR/FCCB issues which was an average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of related shares in the markets, during six months, or two weeks preceding the relevant date was revised in December 2005. The norms stipulated that the floor price must be an average of the weekly highs and lows during the 26 weeks ending a month before the 'relevant date' or the average of the daily highs and lows in the last fortnight of these 26 weeks, whichever is higher. The relevant date is the day the company's AGM approves the issue. This norm made it more difficult for companies to raise money from overseas markets, especially in declining markets since the floor price determined by this formula was high. Since prices fell sharply during 2008, the norms were again revised in 2008. As per the revised norms, the companies have to price their issues at the higher of the two months' average price or 15 days average price preceding the decision to issue shares overseas. Moreover, the closing prices upto the date on which the shareholders decide on the issuance could be considered.

The Indian company issuing ADRs/GDRs has to furnish to the RBI, full details of such issue within 30 days from the date of closing of the issue.

Takeover regulations relating to ADRs/GDRs were amended in August 2009. ADRs/GDRs holder with voting rights will have to make an open offer to minority shareholders if the holding touches the 15 per cent limit.

## **Resources Raised Through Euro Issues**

In 1993–94 and 1994–95, a record number of Euro issues were issued. Indian companies raised  $\overline{\epsilon}14,500$ crore through Euro issues in these two years. India became the only country to have the unusual distinction of the largest number of GDR issues. However, in the subsequent four years, there was a lack of interest in Indian equity overseas. The Indian corporates also postponed their plans of raising funds from abroad due to the South-East Asian crisis and Pokhran blasts.

The year 1999 can be regarded as a watershed year as Indian companies, for the first time, raised equity from the Wall Street. Infosys Technologies was the first company to tap the American market in March 1999, followed by ICICI and Satyam Infoway. Infosys Technologies and Satyam Infoway are listed on the NASDAQ while ICICI is listed on the NYSE. Satyam Infoway was the first Indian company which tapped this overseas market even though it was not listed on any of the Indian stock exchanges.

In 1999–2000, Indian firms raised USD 1 billion and, in 2000–01, around USD 4 billion through ADRs, making them Asia's biggest issuers of ADRs. This capital raised from the overseas market was greater than the total equity mobilization from the domestic market through public issues. Investors responded favourably to the Indian ADRs due to the high growth potential of Indian knowledge-based firms such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology. Rediff.com had become the first dot com company to list at a near 100 per cent premium on the NASDAQ, bypassing the the BSE. With USD 8.6 million in accumulative losses, it could not meet the SEBI's strict criterion of a three-year profitability track record. Indian companies go in directly for ADRs without a domestic offering because the scrip appreciates more in the US markets as the concept of futuristic stocks is stronger in the US.

The domestic retail investor is deprived of the stocks of good companies as these companies no longer tap the domestic primary market. The sluggish primary capital market can be revived if these blue chip companies raise a part of their resources from the domestic market.

## **External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs)**

External Commercial Borrowings are borrowings raised from the international markets by corporates. These overseas borrowings are governed by an ECB policy which is administered by the finance ministry along with the RBI. Indian companies can access funds on a first-come-first-serve basis within an overall limit set in the ECB guidelines.

External Commercial Borrowings supplement domestically available resources for expansion of existing capacity as well as for fresh investment. Indian companies have preferred this route to raise funds as the cost of borrowing is low in the international markets. ECBs need sound risk management–both interest rate and forex risk. Any default has wider repercussions in terms of increasing the risk premium for the subsequent borrowers from India.

Reliance Petroleum raised USD 125 million in the form of ECBs in August 1996. This issue assumes significance as it was the only company which raised resources from the international market without any guarantee from a bank or a financial institution. The issue carried a very low coupon rate of 7.84 per cent.

In October 1996, the first floating rate ECB issue was introduced by Global Telesystems. The company raised 60 million Swiss francs (around USD 48 million) in the form of fully convertible bonds. The company offered an interest rate of 175 basis points over the LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offer Rate).

SIDBI raised USD 20 million for 38 years–one of the largest tenored ECBs raised in the country–in 2005. Reliance Petroleum, Adani Power, and Essar Oil each raised USD 500 million during 2007–08.

ECBs are a key component of India's overall external debt which includes, external assistance, buyers' credit, suppliers' credit, NRI deposits, short-term credit, and rupee debt. ECB refer to commercial loans (in the form of bank loans, buyers' credit, suppliers' credit, securitized instruments (such as floating rate notes, and fixed-rate bonds) availed from non-resident lenders with minimum average maturity of three years. It also includes credit from official export credit agencies and commercial borrowings from the private sector window of multilateral financing institutions.

ECBs can be accessed under two routes, the automatic route and the approval route.

# **Guidelines relating to External Commercial Borrowings PART I**

#### *1. Framework for Raising Loans Through External Commercial Borrowings*

**1.1 External Commercial Borrowings (ECB):** ECBs are commercial loans raised by eligible resident entities from recognized non-resident entities and should conform to parameters such as minimum maturity, permitted and non-permitted end-uses, maximum all-in-cost ceiling, etc. The parameters apply in totality and not on a standalone basis. The framework for raising loans through ECB (herein after referred to as the ECB Framework) comprises the following three tracks:

Track I: Medium-term foreign currency denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 3/5 years.

Track II: Long-term foreign currency denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 10 years.

Track III: Indian rupee (INR) denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 3/5 years.

**1.2 Forms of ECB:** The ECB framework enables permitted resident entities to borrow from recognized non-resident entities in the following forms:

- i. Loans including bank loans;
- ii. Securitized instruments (e.g., floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds, non-convertible, optionally convertible or partially convertible preference shares/debentures);
- iii. Buyers' credit;
- iv. Suppliers' credit;
- v. Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs);
- vi. Financial Lease; and
- vii. Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds (FCEBs)

However, ECB framework is not applicable in respect of the investment in Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs) in India made by Registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (RFPIs).

**1.3 Available routes for raising ECB:** Under the ECB framework, ECBs can be raised either under the automatic route or under the approval route. For the automatic route, the cases are examined by the Authorised Dealer Category-I (AD Category-I) banks. Under the approval route, the prospective borrowers are required to send their requests to the RBI through their ADs for examination. While the regulatory provisions are mostly similar, there are some differences in the form of amount of borrowing, eligibility of borrowers, permissible end-uses, etc. under the two routes. While the first six forms of
borrowing, mentioned at 2.2 above, can be raised both under the automatic and approval routes, FCEBs can be issued only under the approval route.

**1.4 Parameters for ECBs:** Various parameters of raising loan under ECB framework are mentioned in the following sub-paragraphs.

**1.4.1 Minimum Average Maturity Period:** The minimum average maturities for the three tracks are set out as under:

**1.4.2 Eligible Borrowers:** The list of entities eligible to raise ECB under the three tracks is set out in the following table.

**1.4.3 Recognised Lenders/Investors:** The list of recognized lenders/investors for the three tracks will be as follows:

*Notes:* 2. Overseas branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks can be lenders only under Track I. Further, their participation under this track is subject to the prudential norms issued by the Department of Banking Regulation, RBI. Indian banks are not permitted to participate in refinancing of existing ECBs.

3. Overseas Organizations proposing to lend ECB would have to furnish to the authorised dealer bank of the borrower a certificate of due diligence from an overseas bank, which, in turn, is subject to regulation of host-country regulators and such host country adheres to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines on Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT). The certificate of due diligence should comprise the following: (i) that the lender maintains an account with the bank at least for a period of two years, (ii) that the lending entity is organised as per the local laws and held in good esteem by the business/local community, and (iii) that there is no criminal action pending against it.

4. Individual lender has to obtain a certificate of due diligence from an overseas bank indicating that the lender maintains an account with the bank for at least a period of two years. Other evidence/documents such as audited statement of account and income tax return, which the overseas lender may furnish, need to be certified and forwarded by the overseas bank.

Notes: 5. The respective conditions will be applicable for all three tracks.

**1.4.6 Individual Limits:** The individual limits refer to the amount of ECB which can be raised in a financial year under the automatic route.

- i. The individual limits of ECB that can be raised by eligible entities under the automatic route per financial year for all the three tracks are set out as under:
  - a. Up to USD 750 million or equivalent for the companies in infrastructure and manufacturing sectors, Non-Banking Financial Companies—Infrastructure Finance Companies (NBFC-IFCs), NBFCs-Asset Finance Companies (NBFC-AFCs), Holding Companies and Core Investment Companies;
  - b. Up to USD 200 million or equivalent for companies in software development sector;
  - c. Up to USD 100 million or equivalent for entities engaged in micro finance activities; and d. Up to USD 500 million or equivalent for remaining entities.
- ii. ECB proposals beyond aforesaid limits will come under the approval route. For computation of individual limits under Track III, exchange rate prevailing on the date of agreement should be taken into account.
- iii. In case the ECB is raised from direct equity holder, aforesaid individual ECB limits will also subject to ECB liability: equity ratio<sup>6</sup> requirement. For ECB raised under the automatic route, the ECB liability of the borrower (including all outstanding ECBs and the proposed one) towards the foreign equity holder should not be more than four times of the equity contributed by the latter. For ECB raised under the approval route, this ratio should not be more than 7:1. This ratio will not be applicable if total of all ECBs raised by an entity is up to USD 5 million or equivalent.

**Notes** 6. For the purpose of ECB liability: equity ratio, the paid-up capital, free reserves (including the share premium received in foreign currency) as per the latest audited balance sheet can be reckoned for calculating the 'equity' of the foreign equity holder. Where there are more than one foreign equity holders in the borrowing company, the portion of the share premium in foreign currency brought in by the lender(s) concerned shall only be considered for calculating the ratio.

**1.4.7 Currency of Borrowing:** ECB can be raised in any freely convertible foreign currency as well as in Indian rupees. Further details are given below:

- i. In case of rupee denominated ECB, the non-resident lender, other than foreign equity holders, should mobilise Indian rupees through swaps/outright sale undertaken through an AD Category-I bank in India.
- ii. Change of currency of ECB from one convertible foreign currency to any other convertible foreign currency as well as to INR is freely permitted. Change of currency from INR to any foreign currency is, however, not permitted.
- iii. Change of currency of ECB into INR can be at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the agreement between the parties concerned for such change or at an exchange rate which is less than the rate prevailing on the date of agreement if consented to by the ECB lender.

**1.5 Hedging Requirements:** Borrowers eligible in terms of paragraph 1.4.2.vi above shall have a board approved risk management policy and shall keep their ECB exposure hedged 100 per cent at all times. Further, the designated AD Category-I bank shall verify that 100 per cent hedging requirement is complied with during the currency of ECB and report the position to RBI through ECB 2 returns. Also, the entities raising ECB under the provisions of tracks I and II are required to follow the guidelines for hedging issued, if any, by the concerned sectoral or prudential regulator in respect of foreign currency exposure.

**1.5.1 Operational Aspects on Hedging:** Wherever hedging has been mandated by the RBI, the following should be ensured:

- i. **Coverage:** The ECB borrower will be required to cover principal as well as coupon through financial hedges. The financial hedge for all exposures on account of ECB should start from the time of each such exposure (i.e. the day liability is created in the books of the borrower).
- ii. **Tenor and rollover:** A minimum tenor of one year of financial hedge would be required with periodic rollover duly ensuring that the exposure on account of ECB is not unhedged at any point during the currency of ECB.
- iii. **Natural Hedge:** Natural hedge, in lieu of financial hedge, will be considered only to the extent of offsetting projected cash flows/revenues in matching currency, net of all other projected

outflows. For this purpose, an ECB may be considered naturally hedged if the offsetting exposure has the maturity/cash flow within the same accounting year. Any other arrangements/ structures, where revenues are indexed to foreign currency will not be considered as natural hedge.

**1.6 Security for Raising ECB:** AD Category-I banks are permitted to allow creation of charge on immovable assets, movable assets, financial securities and issue of corporate and/or personal guarantees in favour of overseas lender/security trustee, to secure the ECB to be raised/raised by the borrower, subject to satisfying themselves that:

The ECBs were a preferred route to raise borrowed funds by large and mid-sized companies as the rate of interest was in the international markets.

#### **Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs)**

FCCBs are bonds issued by Indian companies and subscribed to by a non-resident in foreign currency. They carry a fixed interest or coupon rate and are convertible into a certain number of ordinary shares at a preferred price. They are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuing company either in whole, or in part, on the basis of any equity-related warrants attached to the debt instruments. These bonds are listed and traded abroad. Till conversion, the company has to pay interest in dollars and if the conversion option is not exercised, the redemption is also made in dollars. Thus, foreign investors prefer convertible bonds whereas Indian companies prefer to issue GDRs. The interest rate is low but the exchange risk is more in FCCBs as interest is payable in foreign currency. Hence, only companies with low debt equity ratios and large forex earnings potential opt for FCCBs.

Corporates can raise FCCBs at a coupon rate of 1.5 per cent which is lower than the domestic rate. The yield-to-maturity in case of these bonds is around 6–7 per cent and it is to be paid only at the end of the tenure.

The scheme for issue of FCCBs and ordinary shares was notified by the government in 1993 to allow companies easier access to foreign capital markets. Under the scheme, bonds upto USD 50 million are cleared automatically, those up to USD 100 million by the Reserve Bank, and those above that by the finance ministry. The minimum maturity period for FCCBs is five years but there is no restriction on the time period for converting the FCCBs into shares.

The interest rate in FCCBs is much lower than bond issuances or loan syndications. The equity component in a FCCB is an attractive feature for investors. Higher the premium for conversion of equity, higher will be the yield on the FCCB. FCCBs straddle both the worlds of equity and debt. FCCBs are less dilutive than equity and are cheaper than debt. In case of FCCBs, equity dilution is not immediate and happens gradually as the bonds get converted into underlying local shares in a phased manner. Initial outflow on interest payments is extremely low since the coupon rate lies between 0 and 1.5 per cent.

When the stock markets become buoyant, FCCBs are a more preferred route to raise foreign currency funds than pure ECBs. Indian companies have issued around USD 20 billion to 50 billion of FCCBs over the past few years to meet their growth plans.

The issuance of FCCBs was brought under the ECB guidelines in August 2005. Issuance of FCCBs shall conform to the Foreign Direct Investment guidelines including sectoral cap. In addition to the requirements of (i) minimum maturity of 5 years, (ii) the call  $\&$  put option, if any, shall not be exercisable prior to 5 years, (iii) issuance without any warrants attached, (iv) the issue related expenses not exceeding 4 per cent of issue size and in case of private placement, not exceeding 2 per cent of the issue size, etc. as required in terms of provisions contained in Regulation 21 of the Foreign Exchange Management

#### **Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds (FCEBs)**

Foreign currency exchangeable bond is a bond offered by an issuing company and subscribed to by investors living outside India and exchangeable into equity shares of another company, which is called the offered company, in any manner, either wholly or partly or on the basis of any equity-related warrants attached to debt instruments. For example, Tata Sons, a promoter of all key Tata group companies, issues exchangeable bonds to raise funds for Tata Motors.

The Central Government notified the FCEB scheme for facilitating issue of Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds by Indian Companies. This scheme was operationalized with effect from September 23, 2008.

Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bond means a bond expressed in foreign currency, the principal, and interest in respect of which is payable in foreign currency, issued by an Issuing Company and subscribed to by a person who is resident outside India, in foreign currency and exchangeable into equity share of another company (offered company), in any manner, either wholly, or partly or on the basis of any equity

#### **Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds**

- Carry an equity component being a debt instrument.
- Give the investor a choice to convert his bond into fixed number of shares at a predetermined price or to receive a fixed yield to maturity.

The issuing company should also submit audit trail of the end-use of the proceeds by the issuing company/ promoter group companies to the Reserve Bank duly certified by the designated Authorized Dealer bank.

**Operational procedure**—Issuance of FCEB shall require prior approval of the Reserve Bank under the Approval Route for raising ECB. The reporting arrangement for FCEB shall be as per extant ECB policy.

FCEBs would help the promoter to meet the financing requirements within the group firms especially in cases of acquisitions of foreign firm by a promoter group company. FCEBs have also not taken off so far.

#### **MASALA BONDS**

Indian corporate were allowed to raise foreign denominated currency through debt including external commercial borrowings, trade credits and bonds which accounted for about one fifth of the total corporate funding. This type of foreign currency borrowing exposes corporates to exchange rate risk which need to be hedged. If the exchange rate risk is not sufficiently hedged, then the firms face a possibility of losses in the event of a large and adverse exchange rate movement, which may have systemic risk.

Few countries allowed the corporates to float off-shore local currency bonds and these issues have grown significantly. The Reserve Bank of India in June, 2015 allowed Indian corporates to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas. Rupee denominated debt which does not carry any systemic risk can attract foreign investors as it offers an ease of access to Indian market compared to the hassles involved in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) registration. Prior to this general permission by the Reserve Bank, multilateral agencies and International Financial Institutions such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) had obtained permission from the reserve bank to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas. IFC named its rupee denominated bonds as "Masala Bonds" and had been successful in issuing these bonds on multiple occasions with maturity as long as fifteen years.

In August 2016, the RBI allowed banks to raise long-term rupee denominated bonds overseas for financing infrastructure and affordable housing.

#### **Framework for Issuance of Rupee Denominated Bonds Overseas**

Form of Borrowing: The framework for issuance of rupee denominated bonds overseas enables eligible resident entities to issue only plain vanilla rupee denominated bonds issued overseas in Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliant financial centres. The bonds can be either placed privately or listed on exchanges as per host country regulations.

**Available Routes and Limits of Borrowing:** Eligible entities can issue rupee denominated bonds overseas both under the automatic route and the approval route. Under the automatic route, the amount of borrowing will be up to  $\bar{z}50$  billion per financial year. Cases beyond this limit will require prior approval of the reserve bank under the approval route. Issuance of rupee denominated bonds overseas will be within the aggregate limit of INR 2443.23 billion for foreign investment in corporate debt.

**Parameters of Borrowing by Issuance of Rupee Denominated Bonds:** Various parameters for raising loan under the framework for issuance of rupee denominated bonds overseas are given below:

**1 Minimum Maturity:** The bonds shall have minimum maturity of three years. The call and put option, if any, shall not be exercisable prior to completion of minimum maturity.

#### **2 Eligible Borrowers:**

- 2.1 Any corporate or body corporate is eligible to issue such bonds. REITs and INVITs coming under the regulatory framework of the SEBI are also eligible.
- 2.2 Indian banks as eligible borrowers: Indian banks will also be eligible to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas by way of the following instruments:

Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) qualifying for inclusion as additional Tier-1 capital and debt capital instruments qualifying for inclusion as Tier 2 capital; and long term rupee denominated bonds overseas for financing infrastructure and affordable housing.

**3 Recognised Investors:** The rupee denominated bonds can only be issued in a country and can only be subscribed by a resident of a country:

 i. That is a member of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or a member of a FATF-Style Regional Body; and

- ii. whose securities market regulator is a signatory to the International Organization of Securities Commission's (IOSCO's) Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding or a signatory to bilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for information sharing arrangements; and
- iii. should not be a country identified in the public statement of the FATF as:
  - i. A jurisdiction having a strategic anti-money laundering or combating the financing of terrorism deficiencies to which counter measures apply; or
  - ii. A jurisdiction that has not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or has not committed to an action plan developed with the financial action task force to address the deficiencies.

Further, multilateral and regional financial institutions where India is a member country will also be considered as recognized investors.

Indian banks, subject to applicable prudential norms, can act as arranger and underwriter. In case of an Indian bank underwriting an issue, its holding cannot be more than 5 per cent of the issue size after 6 months of issue. However, underwriting by overseas branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks for issuances by Indian banks will not be allowed.

**4 All-in-Cost:** The all-in-cost of borrowing by issuance of rupee denominated bonds should be commensurate with prevailing market conditions.

**5 End-use Prescriptions:** The proceeds of the borrowing can be used for all purposes except for the following:

- i. Real estate activities other than development of integrated township/affordable housing projects;
- ii. Investing in capital market and using the proceeds for equity investment domestically;
- iii. Activities prohibited as per the foreign direct investment guidelines;
- vi. On-lending to other entities for any of the above purposes; and
- v. Purchase of land

**6 Exchange Rate for Conversion:** The exchange rate for foreign currency–rupee conversion shall be the market rate on the date of settlement for the purpose of transactions undertaken for issue and servicing of the bonds.

**7 Hedging:** The overseas investors are eligible to hedge their exposure in rupee through permitted derivative products with AD Category-I banks in India. The investors can also access the domestic market through branches/subsidiaries of Indian banks abroad or branches of foreign banks with Indian presence on a back to back basis.

**8 Leverage Ratio:** The borrowing by financial institutions under the framework shall be subject to the leverage ratio prescribed, if any, by the sectoral regulator as per the prudential norms.

HDFC raised  $\bar{\mathfrak{z}}$ 3,300 crores by issuing rupee denominated unrated bonds to investors in Europe and Asia with 37 months maturity and a yield of 7.3 per cent to foreign investors. These bonds listed on the London Stock Exchange are the largest "Masala Bond" program by any Indian issuer till now.

The market for these bonds may pick up gradually as these bonds attract foreign investors who are looking for a higher yield. The Indian issuer also benefits through the issue of these bonds as it does not have to bear the currency risk and with virtually no restrictions on cost and end-uses.

#### **Conclusion**

The primary market was in a depressed state for a long time. Some unsustained spells of buoyancy were witnessed in 1994–95 (financial sector IPOs), 1999–2000 (IT boom), and the latest in 2002. During the financial years 1994 and 1995, more than 1,000 IPOs were floated in the Indian primary market. In the year 2001–02, only six equity issues aggregating  $\overline{860}$  crore were floated by the private sector.

The primary market was subdued due to lack of investors' confidence. Many fraudulent promoters took advantage of the free pricing regime and duped investors. The SEBI failed to take timely action against these promoters leading to a lack of confidence among investors. They shied away from the primary market. The level of investors' confidence, in turn, is dependent on the performance of the secondary markets. The secondary markets were also coloured with stories of scams which again eroded

investors' confidence. Certain other factors which led to subdued conditions in the primary market were strict disclosure standards and entry point norms, prescribed by the SEBI, which led to a decline in the number of issues by the new companies.

The blue-chip companies tapped the international markets via the GDR/ADR route to raise financial resources. Corporates, financial institutions, and banks preferred the private placement route. The private placement route became more popular than the public issue route. In private placements, it was the debt instruments which gained more popularity as investors preferred safety over higher returns. This led to a rise in the debt–equity ratio of many private sector companies.

The primary market revived during 2004–05 as many good quality scrips from private sector companies were subscribed to, enthusiastically, by the investors. Moreover, the government's disinvestment programme created a favourable climate whereby small investors once again entered the market. In November 2005, along with private provident funds (PFs), superannuation and gratuity funds were also allowed by the finance ministry to invest 5 per cent of their new inflow in stocks The total size of superannuation and gratuity funds is around  $10-15$  per cent of the  $\overline{(}2,50,000)$  crore provident fund sector. Since November 2005, a dozen superannuation and gratuity funds have, for the first time, invested in equity markets. Besides purchasing shares in the secondary market, these retirement funds are also investing in IPOs, follow on equity offerings of companies and some of the equity-linked mutual funds. They can directly invest in only those shares where debt instruments floated by the company have an investment grade, from atleast two rating agencies. The government liberalized the guidelines relating to private provident funds in August 2008, to facilitate more retirement savings to flow into the stock market and help evolve the corporate debt market. Private provident funds can now invest upto 15 per cent of the corpus in the stocks and 40 per cent of the funds in private sector debt instruments. These debt instruments will have to be rated investment grade by just one credit rating agency as opposed to the earlier requirement of two. The revised guidelines will be effective from April 1, 2009. The pension sector should also be opened up so that long-term domestic money can enter the primary and secondary market.

The bearish phase in the stock markets has had an impact on companies, going for raising funds, through public issues. Indian companies need to have a relook at their business and growth plans in the context of global fund crisis.

During the years 2015–16 and 2016–17 larger number of companies came up with IPO issues. These issues got a favourable response from the investors which reflected their growing investment confidence in the capital market.

India has a household saving rate of about 35 per cent of the GDP, which approximately amounts to `6 lakh crore a year. Moreover, the Indian investor is looking for profitable and safe investment avenues. Indian retail investors are usually more interested in buying from the primary market. Small investors are more concerned with gains on the listing date which has converted the primary market into a speculative one. If the merchant bankers appropriately price the issue, this will go a long way in sustaining the revival of the primary market. It is the good faith of the small investors, regulator, and promoter which can help these issues become a success.

### **Summary**

- 1. The primary market is a market for new issues. Funds are mobilized in the primary market through (a) prospectus, (b) rights issues, (c) preferential allotment, and (d) private placement.
- 2. Issues are offered to the public through prospectus and the public subscribes directly.
- 3. IPO is an offering of either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of existing securities or both by an unlisted company for the first time to the public.
- 4. A seasoned public offering (SPO) is an offering of either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale to the public by an already listed company through an offer document.
- 5. Rights issue is the issue of new shares in which existing shareholders are given preemptive rights to subscribe to the new issue on a pro-rata basis.
- 6. A preferential issue is an issue of shares or of convertible securities by listed companies to a select group of persons under Section 81 of the Companies Act, 1956 which is neither a rights issue nor a public issue.

- 7. The direct sale of securities by a company to some select people or to institutional investors is called private placement. Private placement refers to the direct sale of newly-issued securities by the issuer to a small number of investors through merchant bankers. The public sector garnered huge resources from the private placement market. In terms of instruments, debt instruments, mainly bonds and debentures of different maturities, were preferred the most. Private placements are now regulated. Companies wanting to list their privately placed bonds have to make disclosures as per the Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines.
- There are three categories of participants in the primary market. They are the issuers of securities, investors in securities, and intermediaries.
- 9. There are different intermediaries to an issue such as merchant bankers or book running lead managers (BRLMs), syndicate members, registrars to the issue, bankers to the issue, auditors of the company, and solicitors.
- 10. In 1992, the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed and all controls relating to raising of resources from the market were removed. Hence, now the promoters (issuers of securities) do not require the consent of any authority either for making the issue or for pricing it.
- 11. Book building is a recognized mechanism for capital raising. Book building is a mechanism through which an offer price for IPOs based on the investors' demand is determined. The aim of the process is to have the issue presold and preclude chances of under-subscription/devolvement. The cost and time for making public issues is lowered; the procedures are also simplified. The SEBI reintroduced the moving price band concept in the book built IPOs. The price band can be revised and this revision has to be informed to the stock exchanges. The SEBI lowered the mandatory participation of QIBs in the book built IPOs from 60 per cent to 50 per cent.
- 12. Reverse book building is a process wherein the shareholders are asked to bid for the price at which they are willing to offer their shares. It is just similar to reverse auctions.
- 13. A green-shoe option means an option of allocating shares in excess of the shares included in the public issue and operating a postlisting price stabilizing mechanism for a period, not exceeding 30 days, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VIIIA of the DIP Guidelines. A stabilizing agent (SA) steps in and buys the shares from the market when the share price falls below the offer price. He has the discretion to decide the timing, the quantity, and the price at which to buy shares for stabilizing the post-listing price.
- 14. The on-line issue of shares is issued via the electronic network of the stock exchanges. The guidelines for online issue of shares are incorporated in a new chapter in the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000.
- 15. Three distinct trends in resource mobilization from the primary market through the prospectus and the rights issues. It indicates an increasing trend from 1991–92 to 1994–95, a decreasing trend from 1995-96 onwards, with unsustained spells of revival in 1998–99 and an increasing trend since 2003–04.
- 16. The average share of the private sector in resources mobilized through prospectus and rights was around 45 per cent in 1990s.
- 17. Large issues account for more than 90 per cent of the total issues. In 2003–04, large issues accounted for more than 97 per cent of the total issues and equity issues-dominated bond issues.
- 18. Banks and financial institutions raised large amount of resources from the primary capital market. They emerged as the biggest class of issuers in the years 2002–03 and 2003–04.
- 19. The Indian capital market is getting institutionalized as investors, after burning their fingers, by directly investing in the primary market, and preferring mutual funds as their investment vehicle.
- 20. Indian companies have raised resources from international capital markets through Global Depository Receipts (GDRs), American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs), and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).

- 21. GDRs are essentially equity instruments issued abroad by authorized overseas corporate bodies against the shares/bonds of Indian companies held with nominated domestic custodian banks.
- 22. ADRs are negotiable instruments, denominated in dollars, and issued by the US Depository Bank.
- 23. FCCBs are bonds issued by Indian companies and subscribed to by a non-resident in foreign currency. They carry a fixed interest or coupon rate and are convertible into a certain number of ordinary shares at a preferred price.
- 24. ECBs can be accessed under two routes, namely, automatic route and approval route.
- 25. Resources mobilized by way of Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) registered a sharp increase. Companies are attracted towards raising ADRs as they are free to decide the deployment of funds either in the US or in India.
- 26. As Indian companies tap foreign capital markets to raise funds, similarly, foreign companies can now issue their shares to Indian nationals in India.

## **Mini Case**

Ritu is a first year MBA student who is always missing her Garam Masala Chai and Samosas made by Sevakram's Mobile Restaurant in her hometown of Bhopal. She approaches Sevakram with a business partnership proposal to open a similar mobile restaurant in Amdavad near her college. Sevakram is horrified. He is not willing to invest in a city that is unfamiliar to him and is more than a thousand kilometers away. However, he has known Ritu for many years as she had patronized his restaurant for years and had never asked for payment credit and had always paid cash. Thus, he offers her his secret formulas in return for 5 per cent of gross revenues that she can make creating products using his formulas. Ritu gladly accepts the deal.

She creates samples of Chai, samosas, cold sandwiches, and idlis using Sevakram's secret formulas and serves them to her classmates. Her classmates love the Chai and eatables. She tells them that she plans to drop out of the MBA course and start a business selling Chai and these eatables across the whole country. She convinces ten of her classmates to contribute  $\bar{\tau}$ 1,000.00 each at 10 per cent simple annual interest with the principal due after two years and one free Chai and eatables every week till she pays back the loan.

With the seed money that she has now she rents a ultra small mobile kiosk and names it Ritu's Tea House and hires a couple of friends to sell these eatables from her kiosk. Meanwhile, she focuses on creating these products and streamlining the production process at her apartment. She delivers these products thrice a day to her kiosk. Ritu's Tea House even though a small kiosk is a big success in her university campus. Three months later, her 10 friends contribute an additional  $\bar{z}50,000.00$  to start another kiosk and a commercial kitchen where she can create these eatables. She hires production staff and logistics staff and six months later, she has paid off all her loans and has two very successful kiosks, a commercial kitchen with trained staff and a small logistics department who delivers on bicycles, and a very happy Sevakram with his 5 per cent royalties and a happy set of friends who have had a return of 10 per cent in nine months and 40 sets of free eatables.

#### **Questions for Discussion**

- 1. Ritu has approached you, a financial consultant, to help her out with additional finances. She wants to open 18 more kiosks in the campus since the campus has many colleges and hostels and 20 kiosks will comfortably survive without cannibalizing each others' sales. What will be your recommendation?
- 2. Fifteen months later Ritu approaches you again for help, with additional funding. All her 20 kiosks are a runaway success and her commercial kitchen is running at full capacity. She has a small managerial team of three people who are now managing the kitchen and the logistics. In a

range of 5 km outside the campus, there are enough commercial businesses to support at least 100 kiosks. Ritu wants to hire a real-estate manager to negotiate kiosk areas in the commercial and retail buildings, she wants to buy two delivery trucks for her logistics department, and she needs funding to create and run the additional 100 kiosks. What will be your recommendation?

3. Two years later Ritu has again approached you for your help. Ritu's Tea Houses' revenues this year will exceed  $\overline{53}$  crore Ritu, now an MBA dropout, is very satisfied with her success but she has not achieved her vision of having Ritu's Tea House in every city, town, and village of the country. She wants to know if she should now become like a Sevakram and franchise her business model to other franchisees or should she keep growing the way she has grown in the past four years? Discuss the funding needs and intermediaries that will be involved in both the approaches.
