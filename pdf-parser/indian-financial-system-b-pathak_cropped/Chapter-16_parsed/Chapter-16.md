# **Introduction**

Life is full of risks. Being a social animal and risk averse, man always tries to reduce risk. An age-old method of sharing of risk through economic cooperation led to the development of the concept of 'insurance'.

Insurance may be described as a social device to reduce or eliminate risk of loss to life and property. Insurance is a collective bearing of risk. Insurance spreads the risks and losses of few people among a large number of people as people prefer small fixed liability instead of big uncertain and changing liability. Insurance is a scheme of economic cooperation by which members of the community share the unavoidable risks. The risks which can be insured against include fire, the perils of sea, death, accidents, and burglary. The members of the community subscribe to a common pool or fund which is collected by the insurer to indemnify the losses arising out of risks. Insurance cannot prevent the occurrence of risk but it provides for the losses of risk. It is a scheme which covers large risks by paying small amount of capital. Insurance is also a means of savings and investment.

Insurance involves four aspects

- An asset
- The risk insured against
- The principle of pooling
- The contract

When person having similar assets exposed to similar risks contribute into a common pool of funds, it is known as pooling.

Insurance and mutual funds are fundamentally different in their objectives. The objective of insurance is to cover the eventuality of death and therefore, is more long-term in its outlook while, mutual funds are purely investment gain vehicles.

Insurance can be defined as a legal contract between two parties whereby one party called the insurer undertakes to pay a fixed amount of money on the happening of a particular event, which may be certain or uncertain. The other party called the insured pays in exchange a fixed sum known as premium. The insurer and the insured are also known as assurer, or underwriter, and assured, respectively. The document which embodies the contract is called the policy.

An insurance policy is a special type of contract. It is synallagmatic and aleatory in character. A synallagmatic contract is one by which each of the contracting parties binds himself to the other. It is aleatory because the insurer's obligation to pay a loss (claims) is distant and often uncertain, while the insured must pay a fixed premium during the policy period. Thus while the sacrifice (premium) is certain and immediate, the benefits (claims) are distant and contingent for the insured. This makes it a unique financial product, requiring a broader understanding of pure and speculative risks to which an individual or enterprise is exposed, in order to take an informed buying decision.

The insurance companies are *distinct financial institutions (intermediaries)* in the financial system.

- 1. Insurers collect insurance premiums by issuing insurance policies which are debt instruments (claims) and invest these premiums in financial assets and markets to generate cash flows to pay future claims. Thus, insurers are liability-driven financial intermediaries.
- 2. Unlike other intermediaries, insurers have to hold risk capital or solvency capital to ensure their obligations to the insured. Insurers demonstrate their financial strength

to the insured by holding risk capital which provides a cushion against unexpected losses. Another unique feature of the industry is the distinct principles such as uberrimae fidei, indemnity, subrogation, causa proxima and insurable interest of which underwriters (insurers) are more aware of than the insured.

- 3. Also, insurance pricing differs from the pricing of other products. In case of other products, the producer knows the costs of production and the profit he wants to earn. Insurance is a different activity from most other kinds of business activities. Insurers are in the business of risk. It is very difficult to price risk. In case of insurance, the actual cost of risk coverage can be known only at the expiry of the contract or when the event occurs whereas the premium rate is determined at the beginning of the contract. The determination of premium rate involves a lot of statistics, use of probability theories and study of demographic trends and market trends.
- 4. Marketing of insurance products is a challenging task. Insurance is sold, never bought. The seller (agent) should possess expert knowledge of the insurance products, have the skill in making people listen carefully and strive to establish a long-term relationship with the clients to get repeat business. Only those who are open to new ideas, able to plan their activity well and willing to face challenges can succeed in marketing insurance products.

## **Role of Insurance in Economic Growth**

With the growth of a country's economy, there is an increase in the facilitating role played by the financial services sector. Financial Services play a supportive role in the basic activity of production. Insurance frees industries from the worries of unforeseen losses and uncertainties. Insurance helps the process of the country's growth in various ways:

- 1. Insurance covers many economic risks. It protects entrepreneurs against the risk of damage to or loss of the goods and other assets, which they employ in manufacturing, marketing, transport, and other related activities. This protection offers a kind of stability to business.
- 2. With the cover of insurance on their assets, businessmen and industrialists are able to take bold decisions in enlarging their field of activity, and take financial risks which they cannot otherwise take. Hence, insurance plays a promotional role in nation-building and also increasing the number of jobs for the people.
- 3. Again, there is life insurance, which plays the most useful role in the lives of individuals. Life insurance offers economic safety at reasonable cost to millions of families in the country. In a way, this helps the government also as it lightens the government's burden of providing social welfare to affected families.
- 4. Insurance companies collect premium from policyholders and invest this money in government bonds, corporate securities and other approved channels of investment. In this way, insurance companies are helpful in providing capital for new ventures or expansion of old units. Moreover, these funds are also used for financing the infrastructure projects with long gestation period. Also, this lending of funds for infrastructure and other development favourably influences the decisionmaking process in the government.

Thus insurance aids in the growth of modern economy. By promoting safety against personal losses not only improves the individual's quality of life but also provides smoothness in the working of the affairs of business and industry.

## **Principles of Insurance**

An insurance contract is based on some basic principles of insurance.

- Principle of 'uberrima fides' or principle of utmost good faith.
- Principle of indemnity.
- Doctrine of subrogation.
- Principle of *causa proxima*.
- Principle of insurable interest.
- *Principle of utmost good faith:* It means 'maximum truth'. All material information regarding the subject matter of insurance should be disclosed by both the parties—the insurer and the insured. This duty of full disclosure rests more heavily on the insured than the insurer. The insurer has a right to avoid the contract if the insured fails to make the full disclosure. In case of misrepresentation—innocent or fraudulent, the contract becomes voidable if the representation is substantially false and it is concerned with facts which are material to the risk. The contract becomes voidable on the grounds of non-disclosure when a fact is known to one party and it is not known to the other and moreover, is such that may influence the underwriter's decision if disclosed.

- *Principle of indemnity:* This means that if the insured suffers a loss against which the policy has been made, he shall be fully indemnified only to the extent of loss. In other words, the insured is not entitled to make a profit on his loss. For instance, marine insurance policy is a contract of indemnity which protects against physical and other losses to movable property and associated interests, as well as against liabilities arising during the course of a sea voyage.
- *Doctrine of subrogation:* This means the insurer has the right to stand in the place of the insured after settlement of claims in so far as the insured's right of recovery from an alternative source is involved. The right may be exercised by the insurer before the settlement of the claim. In other words, the insurer is entitled to recover from a negligent third party any loss payments made to the insured. The purposes of subrogation are to hold the negligent person responsible for the loss and prevent the insured from collecting twice for the same loss. Subrogation prevents the insured from collecting twice for the loss—once from the insurance company and then again from the third party. Subrogation arises only in case of contracts of indemnity
- *Principle of causa proxima:* The cause of loss must be direct and an insured one in order to claim for compensation.
- *Principle of insurable interest:* The assured must have insurable interest in the life or property insured. Insurable interest is that interest which considerably alters the position of the assured in the event of loss taking place and if the event does not take place, he remains in the same old position. One who has to lose as a result of loss may be said to have insurable interest in the life or property insured. If this principle is absent, the insurance contract degenerates into a wagering contract. It is taken as given that an individual has insurable interest in his/her own life or property. Cases where no proof of insurable interest is required are that of a husband's interest in his wife's life and wife's interest in her husband's life. In cases of business and family relationships, proof of insurable interest is required.

## **Origin And Development Of Insurance**

The concept of insurance is believed to have emerged almost 4,500 years ago in the ancient land of Babylonia where traders used to bear risk of the caravan by giving loans, which were later repaid with interest when the goods arrived safely. In order to protect against the risk of loss of goods in transit, piracy and natural calamities like storms and so on, medieval guilds (trade associations) formed a common pool of funds, which was used as support in times of sickness and death and sometimes even offered as ransom for members held captive by pirates. The first insurance contract was entered into by European maritime nations in 1347 to accept marine insurance as a practice.

The concept of insurance as we know today took shape in 1688 at a place called Lloyd's Coffee House in London where risk bearers used to meet to transact business. This coffee house became so popular that Lloyd's became the one of the first modern insurance companies by the end of the eighteenth century.

Marine insurance companies came into existence by the end of the eighteenth century. These companies were empowered to write fire and life insurance as well as marine. The Great Fire of London in 1966 caused huge loss of property and life. With a view to providing fire insurance facilities, Dr Nicholas Barbon set up in 1967 the first fire insurance company known as the Fire Office.

The oldest life insurance company in existence today is the Society for the Equitable Assurance of Lives and Survivorship, known as 'Old Equitable'. It was established in England in 1756.

The 'law of large numbers' discovered by Jakob Bernoulls around 1700 forms the basis of modern insurance. Insurers consider their clients as large groups to predict future risk and loss. The larger the group, the closer the average loss will approach a definite value. This law helps the insurer to predict total annual loss for the group which is then distributed among all the insured and recovered in the form of premium.

The mortality tables were constructed in the seventeenth century. The first mortality table was constructed by an astronomer Edmund Haley in 1693. This table provided a link between the life insurance premium and average lifespans based on statistical laws of mortality and compound interest. In 1756, Joseph Dodson reworked the table, linking insurance premium rate to age.

The infamous New York Fire and the great Chicago Fire in 1835 and 1871, respectively, created an awareness and need for insurance. The concept of reinsurance emerged to deal specifically for such situations. Industrialization and urbanization popularized the concept of insurance and growth in insurance led to the development of new insurance products.

## **History of Insurance in India**

The early history of insurance in India can be traced back to the Vedas. The Sanskrit term '*Yogakshema*' (meaning well being), the name of Life Insurance Corporation of India's corporate headquarters, is found in the Rig Veda. Some form of 'community insurance' was practised by the Aryans around 1000 BC. The joint family system prevalent in India was an important form of social cooperation.

Life insurance in its modern form came to India from England in 1818. The Oriental Life Insurance Company was the first insurance company to be set up in India to help the widows of the European community. The insurance companies, which came into existence between 1818 and 1869, treated Indian lives as subnormal and charged an extra premium of 15 to 20 per cent. The first Indian insurance company, the Bombay Mutual Life Assurance Society, came into existence in 1870 to cover Indian lives at normal rates. Moreover, in 1870, the British Government enacted for the first time the Insurance Act, 1870. Other companies, such as the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, the Bharat Insurance Company, and the Empire of India Life Insurance Company Limited, were set up between 1870 and 1900.

The Swadeshi movement of 1905–07, the non-cooperation movement of 1919, and Civil Disobedience Movement of 1929 led to an increase in number of insurance companies. In 1912, the first legislation regulating insurance, the Life Insurance Companies Act, 1912, was promulgated. The growth of life insurance was witnessed during the first two decades of the twentieth century not only in terms of number of companies but also in terms of number of policies and sum assured. *The Indian Insurance Year Book* was published for the first time in 1914.

The Insurance Act, 1938, the first comprehensive legislation governing both life and non-life branches of insurance was enacted to provide strict state control over the insurance business. This amended insurance act looked into investments, expenditure, and management of these companies. An office of the Controller of Insurance came into existence. The Controller of Insurance had wide ranging powers, which included directing, cautioning, advising, prohibiting, inspecting, investigating, searching, seizing, prosecuting, penalizing, authorizing, registering, amalgamating, and liquidating insurance companies.

By the mid-1950s, there were 154 Indian insurers, 16 foreign insurers, and 75 provident societies carrying on life insurance business in India. Insurance business flourished and so did scams, irregularities, and dubious investment practices by scores of companies. As a result, the government decided to nationalize the life assurance business in India. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was set up in 1956 to take over 245 life companies. The nationalization of life insurance was followed by general insurance in 1972. The General Insurance Corporation of India and its subsidiaries were set up in 1973. Most of the powers of the Controller of Insurance were taken away and vested in state-owned LIC and GIC for operational convenience. These nationalized companies enjoyed monopoly for decades. They did a commendable job in extending the distribution network and successfully handled a large volume of business. But with only 20 per cent of the population insured there was a vast potential untapped. Besides, as a sequel to the reform process and to tap the insurance sector as a source of longterm funds, the government decided to introduce reforms in the insurance sector.

The government set up, in 1993, a committee under the chairmanship of R. N. Malhotra, the former insurance secretary and the RBI governor to evaluate the Indian insurance industry and recommend its future direction. This committee submitted its report in 1994 and suggested the re-opening up of the insurance sector to private players. This sector was finally thrown open to the private sector in 2000. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) was set up in 2000 as an autonomous insurance regulator. The government has entrusted the IRDA with the responsibility for carrying out the reforms in this sector.

## **Opening Of The Insurance Sector**

The insurance industry till August 2000 had only two nationalized players: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and General Insurance Corporation (GIC) and its four subsidiaries. These two players had a monopolistic control over the market. These nationalized insurance companies did a commendable job in terms of high growth in volume of business and reach. However, they were not consumer-oriented, unwilling to adopt modern practices and technology to upgrade technical skills, and inefficient in operations. The growth in volume was mainly driven by income tax considerations and hence a major portion of the vast rural area was untapped.

Moreover, with a population of more than one billion and savings rate of around 24 per cent, India has a vast market which is untapped. The foreign insurance companies' external influence and pressure to open up the Indian insurance sector was high.

In 1993, the committee under the chairmanship of R. N. Malhotra, set up to evaluate the Indian Insurance industry and recommend its future direction, submitted its report in 1994 and its major recommendations revolved around the structure and regulation of insurance industry. The main recommendations were as follows:

- The government should bring down its stake in the insurance companies to 50 per cent.
- Private companies with a minimum paid-up capital of  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore should be allowed to enter the industry.

- No single company should be allowed to transact business in both the life and general insurance business. The number of entrants should be controlled.
- Foreign companies may be allowed to enter the industry in collaboration with domestic companies. The committee did not favour foreign companies operating in India through branches.
- Postal Life Insurance should be allowed to operate in the rural markets.
- The mandatory investments of LIC Life Fund in government securities need to be reduced from 15 per cent to 50 per cent.
- The GIC and its subsidiaries should not hold more than 5 per cent in any company.
- The promoters' holding in a private insurance company should not exceed 40 per cent of the total. However, if the promoters wish to start with a higher holding, they should be permitted to do so provided their holding is brought down to 40 per cent within a specified period of time through public offering. No person other than the promoters should be allowed to hold more than one per cent of the equity. Promoters should, at no time, hold less than 26 per cent of the paid-up capital.
- Regulatory and prudential norms as well as conditions for ensuring level-playing field among insurers should be finalized early so that intending entrants into the insurance business would be aware of the stipulations they would have to comply with. These conditions should aim to ensure that life insurers do not neglect the small man or the rural business and that the general insurers have balanced portfolios.
- Though nationalized insurance companies are in a position to face competition, it is essential that they quickly upgrade their technology, reorganize themselves on more efficient lines, and are enabled to operate as board-run enterprises.
- As an interim measure, the office of Controller of Insurance should be restored its full functions under the Insurance Act and it should be set up as a separate office as a matter of high priority.
- Legislation and government notifications through which LIC and GIC were exempted from several provisions of the Insurance Act should be withdrawn.
- A strong and effective insurance regulatory authority in the form of a statutory autonomous board on the lines of the SEBI should be set up.
- The state-level cooperatives should be allowed to set up cooperative societies for transacting life insurance business in the state. There will not be more than one society for each state which will be subject to the regulations of the Insurance Regulatory Authority.
- GIC should cease to be the holding company for its subsidiaries and the exclusive function of GIC should remain that of reinsurer.
- When GIC ceases to be holding company of the four subsidiary companies, then the government should acquire GIC's stake, which is  $\overline{*}40$  crore in every company. This share, then should be raised to  $\overline{\xi}100$  crore for every company, the government holding 50 per cent and the rest being held by the public at large.

Recognising the global trend of competitive, market-driven insurance industry and the recommendations of the Malhotra Committee, the insurance industry was opened up in August 2000. There are at present 24 life insurance and 31 general insurance companies operating in India with more players expected to come in. The IRDA, constituted in April 2000 under the IRDA Act, 1999, is vested with the power to regulate and develop the insurance and reinsurance business (Figure 16.1).

Most of the foreign insurers have preferred to form joint ventures with Indian companies. Banks, financial institutions, and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are permitted to enter the insurance sector. The RBI has issued guidelines regulating the degree of participation of banks, financial institutions and non-banking finance companies in the insurance business depending on balance sheet strength.

The Reserve Bank of India has given NBFCs blanket permission to take up insurance agency business on a fee basis and without risk participation, without the approval of the central bank. However, the risks involved in insurance agency cannot be transferred to the business of the NBFC and they need to obtain permission from the IRDA.

The Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2002, has allowed cooperative societies to carry on insurance business with a view to enhancing coverage in rural areas. This act deals in four broad areas, namely, broker regulation, corporate agent regulations, Section 64VB that deals in payments to be made through credit card and the Internet, and Section 49 that deals with the distribution of acturial surpluses between the shareholder and the policyholder. Corporates acting as corporate agents will have to surrender their licence to be brokers, as there is a conflict of interest between two parties. Banks will co ntinue to be corporate agents and nonbrokers. The designated person, acting on behalf of the corporate agent (like a bank) after leaving their jobs can be an agent without having to take further exams mandated by the regulator. The amended insurance act would form the future legal base for making the regulation on intermediaries.

**Figure 16.1** The Insurance Industry

The Indian insurance industry is governed by the Insurance Act, 1978, the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999.

## **Insurance Regulatory And Development Authority**

The IRDA was constituted as an autonomous body to regulate and develop the business of insurance and reinsurance in India. The authority was constituted on April 19, 2000, vide Government of India's notification no. 277.

The IRDA Act, 1999, was enacted by parliament in the fiftieth year of the Republic of India to provide for the establishment of an authority to protect the interests of holders of insurance policies, to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance industry, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto and further to amend the Insurance Act, 1938, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) act, 1972. The Act was approved in the parliament in December 1999 and the insurance sector was thrown open for private licensees on August 15, 2000. The IRDA was constituted in terms of the IRDA, 1999, as the regulator of the Indian insurance industry.

## **Insurance Regulatory And Development Authority**

The IRDA was constituted as an autonomous body to regulate and develop the business of insurance and reinsurance in India. The authority was constituted on April 19, 2000, vide Government of India's notification no. 277.

The IRDA Act, 1999, was enacted by parliament in the fiftieth year of the Republic of India to provide for the establishment of an authority to protect the interests of holders of insurance policies, to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the insurance industry, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto and further to amend the Insurance Act, 1938, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) act, 1972. The Act was approved in the parliament in December 1999 and the insurance sector was thrown open for private licensees on August 15, 2000. The IRDA was constituted in terms of the IRDA, 1999, as the regulator of the Indian insurance industry.

The IRDA was set up in 1996 but it was formally constituted as a regulator of the insurance industry in April 2000. The regulator was initially known as the Insurance Regulatory Authority but was subsequently rechristened as Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority as it was provided that it had a broader role to perform in the Indian insurance market. It has not only to frame and issue statutory and regulatory stipulations, guidelines, and clarification but it has also to perform a developmental and promotional role. The developmental and promotional role of the regulator include facilitating the growth of the market by attracting a large number of players, integrating of the insurance market with the domestic financial services market, and synchronising the Indian insurance market with that of global insurance market. Thus, the objectives of the IRDA are twofold: policyholder protection and healthy growth of the insurance market.

# **Operations of the IRDA**

• The IRDA has developed its internal parameters to assess the promoters' credentials. The promoters' long-term commitment to stay in the market, their ability to bring in new techniques in insurance underwriting and administration are some of the parameters, which are assessed in the first phase. Subsequent to this preliminary assessment, the IRDA conducts an in-depth assessment of the business plans submitted by the promoter.

The IRDA is the sole authority for awarding licenses. There is no restriction in the number of licenses it can issue, but licenses for life and non-life business are to be issued separately. Licenses are issued only on a national basis. The new players should commence business within 15 to 18 months of getting the license. A new applicant has to pay a registration fee of  $\text{\textless}50,000$ . At the time of renewal of registration every year, a fee of 0.20 per cent of one per cent of the gross premium or  $\text{\textsterling}50,000$  whichever is higher, is levied on the insurers carrying out insurance business in India.

The IRDA has prescribed a 'file and use' procedure, according to which every insurer is required to file the product and pricing details along with copies of standard terms, conditions, and literature. In case of tariff products, the Tariff Advisory Committee is required to file product and pricing details with the IRDA, like any other insurance company.

- All insurance intermediaries, such as agents and corporate agents, have to undergo compulsory training prior to their obtaining a license. The IRDA also specified the minimum educational qualifications for these intermediaries. It conducts examinations and then issues licenses to these agents. It believes that well trained and informed intermediaries can service the consumers better. The IRDA insured or renewed 1,18,154 agents licenses by the end of March 2001. The licensing of Insurance Agents Regulations have specified the qualifications for an insurance agent: hundred hours prelicensing training, followed by an examination. In addition, for new agents 25 hours training to keep knowledge updated has also been prescribed at the time of renewal of license.
- The Insurance Association and Life Insurance and General Insurance Councils have been revived and they are responsible for setting the norms for market conduct, ethical behaviour of the insurers, and breach of regulations. Continuous training has been stipulated to enhance the efficiency of the intermediaries. New players have set up call centres which are functioning on a 24/7 basis.

- The IRDA has recognized the Actuarial Society of India and Insurance Institute of India as nodal organizations responsible for actuarial and insurance education. IRDA has drafted separate bills of the Actuarial Society of India and the Institute of Surveyors and Loss Assessors in order to grant them statutory status.
- The IRDA has also entered into an MoU with the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, to further its objective of insurance research and education. It has set up a risk management resource centre in Bangalore.
- The IRDA has come out with the Insurance Advertisement and Disclosure Regulations to ensure that the insurance companies adhere to fair trade practices and transparent disclosure norms while addressing the policy holders or the prospects.

#### *Steps Taken to Strengthen the Self-regulatory Mechanism in the Insurance Sector*

- The IRDA has laid down the requirements of investment committee, internal audit committee, and joint statutory auditors being appointed for not more than a specified period.
- The Insurance Association of India and the Life Insurance and General Insurance Councils were revived in February 2001 and have membership drawn from the industry.
- A code of conduct for agents and the insurance intermediaries has been laid down to ensure that the affairs of insurance intermediaries are conducted in such a manner as to safeguard the interests of the various stakeholders.

#### *Steps taken by the IRDA to Protect the interests of the Policy holders*

- The IRDA notified the protection of Policyholders' Regulations in April, 2002, which provide for the policy proposal documents being made available in an easily understandable language, outlines the claims procedure in both life and non-life segments, setting up of grievance redressal machinery, speedy settlement of claims and policy holders' servicing. These regulations also provide for interest on delayed payment of the claims and a free lock-in period of 15 days by the prospects/policy holders.
- IRDA has also specified the file and use procedure wherein all insurers are required to file the insurance products with it before their launch in the market so that it can verify that the interest of policy holders is protected, under the terms of the policy document.
- Constitution of a cell within the authority headed by the executive director to receive complaints/grievances from the holders of insurance policies. The cell looks into genuine cases of delay in the settlement of public grievances. However, the cell does not function as an underwriter nor does it decide on issues like the adoption of underwriting practices, the claims procedure etc., by the insurers.
- Making it compulsory for every life insurer to make available the premium rates with a facility of a premium calculator on its web-site, for the information of public.
- Representatives of the Chambers of Commerce have been nominated on the Insurance Councils and the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC), to ensure that the views of the consumers are considered, while taking policy decisions.
- Insurers are required to have a consumer representative on their board.
- It is obligatory on the part of the insurance companies to disclose clearly the benefits, terms and conditions under the policy document.
- Advertisements issued by the insurers are required to make proper disclosures in order to ensure that they do not mislead the insuring public.
- Insurers are required to set up proper grievance redressal machinery at their head office and at the other offices in the country.
- Third party administrators have been introduced in the health sector, to provide improved health insurance services viz., cashless cover, and other add-on facilities.

The broker renders advice on appropriate insurance cover and terms thereof, keeps up to date on the variety of available insurance products and submits quotations received from insurers for consideration of the client.

#### *International Presence of the IRDA*

The IRDA is a member of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, (IAIS) headquartered at Basel, Switzerland. The IAIS is an organization set up by regulators and supervisors of insurance industry. The aims and objectives of the IAIS are to bring in prudential regulations, to prescribe guidelines for the insurance supervisors to observe the industry, to promote international cooperation and understanding
among the supervisors, and to represent before world forums the cause of the insurance industry and the matter of its functioning and regulation. The IRDA is a member of the Emerging Markets and Technical Committees. Its chairman is also a member of the Accounting Sub-Committee and the Insurance Frauds Committee. The IRDA is putting in efforts to bring the Indian insurance market to international standards in areas of financial viability, competence, technology and prudential regulations.

# **Policy Holder's Grievances Redressal System**

Grievance arises when the insurer's services do not match with the costumer (policyholder's) expectations. This gap may arise on account of delay in claims settlement, delay in issuance of policies and non-availability of policies (insurers refusing to cover health risk of the aged), unclear policy wordings, wrongful repudiation/rejection of claims and inadequate material information about the products sold. The policy holder's grievances redressal system has been put in place for redressal of Policy holder's grievances. The system consists of: (i) The in-house grievance redressal cells of the insurers (ii) consumer courts and (iii) civil courts (Figure 16.2).

**Figure 16.2** Policy Holder's Grievances Redressal System

# **Policy Holder's Grievances Redressal System**

The Insurers have recognized the importance of retention of customers as this business is based on trust which ultimately helps in building long-term relationships between the contracting parties. In order to deliver value to the customer, insurers have set up internal grievance redressal cells to reduce and address consumer grievance. Public sector players like LIC and GIC have set up their own internal grievance redressal machinery nominating grievance redressal officers and adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) culture in its operations. The Government has prescribed a citizens' charter for all public offices to address some of the complaints. LIC has set up review committees consisting of retired judges to review the judgments delivered by courts. The private sector companies have provided a toll free helpline number to the customers.

A policy holder can take recourse to the judicial frame to address his grievance. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was enacted to provide a simpler and quicker access to redressal of consumer grievances. The Act for the first time defined 'consumer' and provided machinery whereby consumers can file their complaints against erring suppliers which will be entertained by Consumer Forums with special powers. This Act providers three–tier Courts–District, State and National- for adjudication of consumer disputes. The district forum is the lowest level court situated in the district headquarters. It can hear cases involving amounts of  $\bar{\tau}$ 20 lakh. Above the district forum are state-level consumer courts known as state commission situated in the capital of the state. They can hear cases involving an amount more than rupees twenty lakhs and up to rupees one crore. It has also jurisdiction to hear appeal against the orders of District Forum of that particular state. The national commission is on the top hierarchy of consumer courts and is situated in Delhi. It can hear cases involving amounts above rupees one crore and also hear appeals against the order of state commission.

There is a three-tier system of civil courts in India. At the lowest level are the district courts presided over by a district judge administering justice at a district level. These courts are under administrative and judicial control of the high court of the state to which the district concerned belongs. High courts are the principal civil courts of original jurisdiction in the state or a union territory. At the apex of the hierarchy of the judicial system in India is the Supreme Court of India.

The judicial process is a costly and time-consuming mechanism for redressal of disputes. To provide the insured a speedy and inexpensive grievance redressal system, the Government of India promulgated • Insurance Ombudsman provides a forum for resolving disputes and complaints from the aggrieved insured public or their legal heirs against insurance companies.

Redressal of Public Grievances (RPG) Rules 1988 (under the Insurance Act 1938) to setup an institution of ombudsman. The office of Insurance Ombudsman is a step in building up the confidence of the policy holders in insurers. The Insurance Council is the administrative body of this institution and it has appointed 17 ombudsmen across the country since 1999. The objective of Insurance Ombudsman is to provide a forum for resolving disputes and complaints from the aggrieved insured public or their legal heirs against insurance companies operating in general insurance business and life insurance business in public and private sector. The insurance ombudsman is empowered to receive and consider written complaints in respect of insurance contracts on personal lines where the insured amount is less than  $\bar{\tau}$ 30 lakh. Insurance on 'personal lines' means a policy taken or given in an individual capacity, e.g., life insurance, personal accident insurance, insurance of property of the individual such as motor vehicle, household articles, mediclaim insurance, etc.

The complaints can relate to:

- 1. Grievance against insurer
- 2. Partial or total repudiation of claims by the insurer
- 3. Dispute in regard to premium paid or payable in terms of the policy
- 4. Dispute on the legal construction of the policy in so far as such dispute relate to claims.
- 5. Delay in settlement of claims.
- 6. Non-issue of any insurance document to customers after receipt of premium.

For a complaint to be admissible, it is essential that:

- 1. Before approaching the ombudsman, the complainant should have made a representation to the insurer who had either rejected the complaint or the complainant had not received any reply within one month or the complainant is not satisfied with the reply given by the insurer.
- 2. The complaint is made within one year after the insurer had rejected the complaint or sent his final reply on the complainant's representation.
- 3. The subject matter of complaint should not be pending or considered by any Court or Consumer Forum or Arbitrator.
- 4. Compensation/relief claimed should not exceed  $\overline{30}$  lakh.

An ombudsman is entrusted with two functions—conciliation and award making. The awards passed by an ombudsman are binding on insurers and they are required to honor the awards within three months. The Insurance Ombudsman Scheme is complementary to the regulatory functions of IRDA.

### **Business to be Done by an Insurer in the Rural Sector**

In order to spread insurance to rural areas, the IRDA has made it mandatory for every insurer to undertake business in social and rural sectors.

• The rural sector (where the population is not more than 5,000, population density not more than 400 per sq km, and at least 75 per cent of male working population is engaged in agriculture).

The IRDA relaxed stringent rural sector obligations in September 2002. It removed the strict rural sector definition that was acting as an impediment for new private sector insurance companies to meet their compulsory rural sector obligations. With this, the insurance companies will be allowed to follow the census of India style for identifying and tapping the rural business market. Henceforth, anything that is not urban will be rural.

|             | Population (in Crores) |              |                              |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Census Year | Rural                  | <b>Total</b> | Percentage of Rural to Total |

\* As per the IRDA.

In the amendment to Section 32 B of the Insurance Act, 1938, the new provisions of the section now read as "Every insurer shall, after the commencement of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999, undertake such percentages of life insurance business and general insurance business in the rural and social sector as may be specified, in the official gazette by the IRDA. The insurance regulator reviewed the existing Rural or Social Sector Regulations 2002 and notified IRDAI (Obligations of Insurers to Rural and Social Sectors) Regulations 2015 on August 28, 2015. The salient features of these Regulations are: (i) The obligations specified in the 2015 Regulations are applicable from financial year (FY) 2016–17, (ii) Enhanced the definition of unorganized sector by adding the categories such as daily wager, hired drivers and coolie, (iii) Removed the provisions which prescribed separate obligations for existing insurers as on the date of the commencement of the IRDA Act, 1999 and prescribed uniform criteria of percentages to all the insurers with only the criteria as "Age of the Insurer", (iv) Prescribed separate percentages of rural and social obligations for health insurers as the health insurance is now a separate class of business as per the Insurance Law Amendment Act, 2015, (v) Prescribed percentage (%) of lives on total business of previous financial year for Social Sector obligations in place of the existing provision of absolute number of lives, (vi) Government Sponsored Social Security schemes where entire premium is borne by the Government are not to be considered for both rural and social sector obligations and this provision is applicable for the obligations from financial year 2017–18, (vii) No obligations are prescribed for Agricultural Insurance Company of India Ltd. and Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India owing to the nature of their business, (viii) All micro insurance policies are eligible for social sector obligations and if the same are issued in rural area then they are eligible for both rural and social sector obligations, (ix) Insurer shall put in place effective operational procedures for accurate classification of the business obligations into the rural and social sectors as per these Regulations, (x) An annual certificate needs to be filed by the CEO or the principal officer within 90 days from the end of financial year submitting the actual business details for fulfillment of these obligations, (xi) Re-insurance premium shall not be included while calculating the obligations of the insurers in respect of the rural and social sectors.

| (B) Social Sector In respect of all Insurers (Life, Non-Life, Standalone Health) |  |  |  |  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|

*Note:* Total business for the purpose of these regulations is the total number of policies issued in case of individual insurance and number of lives covered in case of Group Insurance. In case of individual health insurance policies covering the lives of family members, the lives covered under such policy may be taken into account both in determination of target as well as actual performance.

Provided that in cases where an insurer commences operations in the second-half of the financial year and is in operations for less than six months as at 31st March of the relevant financial year, (i) no rural and social sector obligations shall be applicable for the said period, and (ii) the annual obligations as indicated in the regulations shall be reckoned from the next financial year which shall be considered as the first year of operations for the purpose of compliance to this regulations. However, in cases where an insurer commences operations in the first-half of the financial year, that financial year shall be treated as the first year of operations and the applicable obligations for the first year shall be 2500 lives for social sector. Similarly, the obligations for rural sector shall be half of the percentage prescribed for the first year.

### **Insurance Intermediaries**

Distribution is a vital link in the insurance value chain. Its history could be as long as the history of insurance itself. Even in this information age, insurers have found it difficult to do away with distribution channels. A large chunk of insurance business in the world is still being brought by distribution channels. This is because insurance still remains under-sold. Despite the publicity and the increasing awareness, it continues to be a chance affair for the layman. Therefore, this knowledge gap between the insurer and the insured has to be bridged.

Intermediaries are a vital link between the insurer and the insured. They act as a bridge between the insurer and insured and thereby help in increasing the breadth and depth of the insurance market. They are a key distribution channel to an insurer.

The intermediaries associated with the insurance business are agents and surveyors and loss assessors, brokers, third party administrators and banks.

#### **Agents**

Agents are just like the retailers of any consumer product who help in selling and distributing the product. An agent is a person licensed by the Controller of Insurance to do insurance business. After obtaining the license, agents have to enroll with the insurance company to be authorized to work as agents. Agents get the license to sell policies of only one life insurance company and one non-life insurance company at a time. They form a vital link between the insurer and the customer. They are paid a commission on every policy they sell. An agent is now viewed as a financial advisor who is responsible for understanding the customer's needs, recommending and selling policies, and providing any further support. LIC has a network of around 10.62 lakh agents while the private sector insurers have a network of 9.55 lakh agents. As on March 31, 2016, there were over 20.17 lakh agents and 416 corporate agents. According to the IRDA guidelines, the applicant for a corporate agency should normally be a company whose principal business should be other than distribution of insurance products. Insurance business should be a subsidiary activity. However, in exceptional cases, grant of corporate agencies for exclusively doing insurance intermediation can be considered by an insurer. In respect of such cases, the corporate agent should be a public limited company with a minimum share capital of  $\overline{50}$  lakh. The capital should be kept in the form of a deposit in a bank account to be utilized for setting up the office, or be invested in assets, subject to approval by the insurer. Persons who are not regulated by the RBI are not eligible for corporate agency license, unless they have a substantial client base of their own or access to data to identify the prospective policy holders and have a turnover, assets or income of atleast  $\overline{3}15$  crore. Only those persons which are part of a group having Indian Insurance company or a scheduled commercial bank within the group shall be eligible for issue of corporate agency license to do insurance business as the principal business provided this shall be the only corporate agency amongst all the entities in the group. Corporate agencies, including bancassurance, contributed over three-fourths of the business mobilized through all the new channels during 2008–09.

Insurance is a financial product requiring technical and product knowledge. In order to develop agents as independent and competent financial advisors, the IRDA has stipulated compulsory training of 100 hours followed by an eligibility test for agents. Those who successfully complete the test and training are granted a license by the IRDA. The IRDA permits companies, banks, and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to become insurance agents. Corporate agents will be tied to a single insurance company and will represent the insurance company in selling insurance product to prospective customers.

#### *Requirements for an Agent*

- *Educational qualification*: Class X examination (in rural areas) Class XII (urban areas)
- *Formal qualification*: 100 hours of training for life/general insurance. 150 hours training for both
- *Licensing qualification*: Examination to be conducted by the Insurance Institute of India

*Corporate Agents*: IRDA has issued IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2015. Some of the salient features of this regulation are as under:

- a. A Corporate Agent (Life) may have arrangements with a maximum of three life insurers to solicit, procure and service their insurance products
- b. A Corporate Agent (General) may have arrangements with a maximum of three general insurers to solicit, procure and service their insurance products. Further, the Corporate Agent (General) shall solicit, procure and service retail lines of general insurance products and commercial lines of such insurers having a total sum insured not exceeding rupees five crores per risk for all insurances combined.
- c. A Corporate Agent (Health) may have arrangements with a maximum of three health insurers to solicit, procure and service their insurance products.
- d. In the case of Corporate Agent (Composite) the conditions as specified in clauses (a) to (c) shall apply.
- e. Any change in the arrangement with the insurance companies shall be done only with the prior approval of the authority and with suitable arrangements for servicing existing policyholders.
- f. An applicant exclusively doing insurance distribution shall have a minimum equity share capital or contribution and net worth of rupees fifty lakh. They shall maintain the net worth at all times.
- g. A registration once issued shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of its issue, unless the same is suspended or cancelled pursuant to these regulations.

## **Surveyors and Loss Assessors**

Surveyors and loss assessors are independent professionals appointed by an insurance company to assess the loss or damage when a claim is notified under a policy issued by them. An insurance surveyor must be duly licensed by the IRDA which has a laid down code of conduct for them. It has also classified them into three categories—A, B, and C—based on their skill and experience. Insurance companies allot them work depending on their competence in the relevant fields. In other words, the selection of the surveyor by the insurance company depends on his qualification and the estimated loss involved.

The duties of a surveyor are to investigate and confirm the cause of loss, assess the quantum of loss, determine the liability of the insurers, advise the insured to take necessary steps to contain the loss, and act on behalf of the insurance company in disposal of salvage to realise maximum value. The surveyor also serves as risk advisors to the general insurance companies. They advise these companies on how the risk can be minimized, based on their technical knowledge and practices.

Sub-section 4 of Section 64 UM of the act states that "No claim in respect of a loss which has occurred in India and requiring to be paid or settled in India equal to or exceeding an amount specified in the regulations by the authority in value on any policy of general insurance, arising or intimated to an insurer,

- Surveyors and Loss Assessors are independent professionals who assess the loss or damage when a claim is notified under a policy issued.
- To settle a loss of ₹20,000 and above under a policy of general insurance, a report submitted by any person licensed to act as surveyor and loss assessor is essential.

be admitted for payment or settled unless a report is obtained on the loss occurred, from any person who holds a license issued under this section to act as surveyor or loss assessor (also referred to as "approved surveyor or loss assessor").

Regulation 12 of IRDAI (Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors) Regulations, 2015 stipulates the limit on survey in as under:

Regulation 12(2)—Surveyors and loss assessors shall be appointed either by insurers or insured to assess loss under a policy of insurance in respect of

- a. Motor insurance—above rupees fifty thousand
- b. Other than motor insurance—above rupees one lakh

Regulation 12(3) – The above mentioned limit shall be reviewed every three years by the authority. Being an insurance intermediary, surveyors have to obtain registration under Section 42D of the Insur-

ance Act, 1938 and the license has to be renewed every three years.

A surveyor is an independent professional who is impartial and objective in his assessment. The IRDA has laid down the financial limits for categorized surveyors to carry out a survey. IRDA has issued 1829 licenses to surveyor and loss assessors as on March 2016.

## **Brokers**

Brokers are just like agents but with a difference. Unlike agents, they can sell policies of several life and non-life insurance companies at a time.

Insurance brokers are professionals who assess risk on behalf of their clients, provide advice on mitigation of the said risk, identify the optimal insurance policy structure, bring together the insurer and the insured, carry out the preparatory work for entering into the insurance contracts, and facilitate processing where claims arise. The brokers are retained by the insureds, and are thus primarily responsible to them.

The IRDA has allowed brokers to enter the insurance industry. To ensure the quality of service provided to the end customer, the IRDA has created four categories of brokers and specified the minimum capital requirement for each of the category.

The IRDA has made it mandatory for every insurance broker to take a professional indemnity insurance cover with an insurer in India, to indemnify him against breach of duty, libel, slander, loss of money, or other property for which he is legally liable in consequence of any financial or fraudulent act, legal liability incurred by reason of loss of documents, and costs and expenses incurred in replacing such documents, or any financial penalty imposed on him.

The functions of brokers are specified by the IRDA and include provision of technical advice, advice on developments in the insurance market and the law, providing written acknowledgments and progress reports, and assisting in the negotiation of claims. The play a key role in designing the insurance cover and documentation of the insurance policy to ensure that all terms agreed at the time of striking the deal are covered in the policy.

| Category of Insurance Broker | Type of Broker                  | Minimum Capital Required $(3 \nvert n$ Lakhs) |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Category I                   | Direct General Insurance Broker | 50                                            |
| Category II                  | Direct Life Insurance Broker    | 50                                            |
| Category III                 | Reinsurance Broker              | 200                                           |
| Category IV                  | Composite Broker                | 250                                           |

The functions of brokers are quite distinct from that of agents—the traditional intermediary. Agents are the representatives of the insurers through whom they sell their insurance products while brokers are representatives of the insurance buyer to whom they provide the service of comparing the policies offered by different insurers with expertise. Brokers are free to source the best product, service and price arrangement from any insurance company in India. They are also free to deal with multiple insurance companies.

The remuneration of direct life and direct general insurance cannot exceed 17.5 per cent of the premium payable on a policy, while that of reinsurance and composite brokers is determined by the market forces.

The IRDA has opened the doors of PSUs to insurance brokers. The brokerage/commission will be payable to all the brokers who intend to service the non-tariff business of public sector entities and only the tariff portion of the business shall continue to remain out of the scope of the activities of an insurance broker.

There are 368 insurance brokers approved and registered by the IRDA—315 direct brokers, 47 composite brokers and 6 reinsurance brokers.

The entry of brokers, has increased competition and made insurance a market-driven industry. Introduction of this intermediary in the insurance market is likely to result in improvement in customer service, transfer of international know-how on insurance into the country, increase insurance penetration, and improve the retention levels within the country. The role of the broker will increase in the de-tariff market.

## **Third Party Administrators**

Third party administrators (TPAs) are the middlemen in the healthcare delivery chain, which links physicians, hospitals, clinics, home health, long-term care facilities and pharmacies. In the US, most insurance companies have their own TPAs, while, in India, TPAs are separate external entities. These TPAs serve more than one insurer at a time. TPAs get a licence for a period of three years and after three years they have to get the licence renewed.

Third party administrators (TPAs) are distributors of insurance products in the health insurance sector. They facilitate the smooth operation of a health cover by acting as a link between the insurance companies and their clients and hospitals. The IRDA has set up the minimum cap of  $\bar{\tau}$  one crore for TPAs. The IRDA has also prescribed a qualified medical doctor as one of the corporate directors to obtain a licence. TPAs are engaged for post-claims management. They enable cashless payment of claims to the insured wherein they settle claims with hospital instead of insurers.

In October 2002, the four state-owned non-life insurance companies—National Insurance, New India Assurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance appointed third-party administrators to perform the task of networking with hospitals and screening health insurance claims. The TPAs were given a commission of 5.6 per cent of the mediclaim insurance premium for providing this service. The four state owned general insurers have empanelled over two dozen third party administrations (TPAs) for managing the 'mediclaim' policy. All new mediclaim policies will be serviced by TPAs. Insurers have allocated divisions falling under each regional office to an external TPA. The data, in respect of all new policies, will be forwarded to the TPAs who, within seven days will issue an identity card and guidebook detailing claim procedures. The TPAs will man 24-hour call centres and direct the insured to a suitable hospital, with which they have a tie up, in the event of an ailment. The TPAs will also be provided with float funds by insurance companies to settle claims with hospitals. Insurers will pay a fee of around 5.5 per cent of the premium which will be passed on to the insured.

The TPAs empanelled by the four insurers have a network ranging from expensive hospitals to small nursing homes. They are offering cashless hospitalization services since October 2002, through their extensive network. The cashless facility offers the policy holder a distinct benefit of not having to pay the hospital. The policy holder has to merely quote the policy number and display the health card which frees him from the cumbersome reimbursement procedures of a traditional policy.

As on April 6, 2017, there were 27 empanelled TPAs. The growth of this particular line of business is hampered due to multiple complaints about servicing the insured, including repudiation of claims due to conditions/exclusions in the policy; non-settlement of claim/delay in settlement of claim; cancellation of policy without giving any notice; settlement of claim for lesser amount; refusal to • TPAs are licensed by IRDA for the provision of health cover.

## **Bancassurance**

• Bancassurance is an innovative distribution channel involving banks to sell insurance products of insurance companies.

Bancassurance is insurance companies tying up with banks to sell insurance products. Bancassurance is an innovative distribution channel in India. In France, over half of the insurance products are sold through banks, while the share of bancassurance in Hongkong is 25 per cent, UK 18 per cent, and Singapore 15 per cent. In the US, banks lease space to insurers and retail products of multiple insurers just similar to a retailer selling different products of different companies under one roof.

The RBI, in recognition of the symbiotic relationship between banking and insurance industries, identified three routes of participation in the insurance business, namely, – only referral model, a tie-up model with an insurance company becoming a corporate agency model where the insurer and banker join hands together; and a joint venture model where a bank along with an Indian or foreign insurer starts its own insurance company. However, most of the banks choose a corporate agency model or a joint venture model. Bancassurance emerged as a preferred route for banks as other routes involve compliance to stringent entry norms. Moreover, banks can increase their profits without setting aside additional capital. Banks have, of late, realized that they have to leverage their distribution strengths to increase their feebased income for survival. Over 20 banks have tied up with public and private sector insurance companies to sell their products. The synergy between some products (such as insurance cover for housing loans) makes banks ideal partners of insurance companies. In addition, through this partnership, new insurance companies get a readymade consumer data-base and higher reach to compete with public sector insurance companies. In order to facilitate the banks to take up the business of insurance broking without having to set up a separate subsidiary, IRDA has allowed scheduled banks to function as Direct Insurance Brokers. The banks need to obtain a prior approval of the RBI and designate a general manager or equivalent cadre officer as principal officer to look after insurance broking business.

Cooperative banks, cover more than 65 per cent of the rural population. These banks can serve as important vehicles for distributing insurance products in rural areas. The private and foreign banks are aggressive sellers of insurance products as commissions are over 35 per cent of the first year premium. Looking to the attractive margins in bancassurance, the public sector banks are focusing on this business.

The banks are allowed to have an insurance partner—life, general & health insurance company—to sell their insurance products. Now this limit has been increased by the IRDAI to three companies in each category, thus making the banks as insurance brokers.

In order to expand their reach, life insurance companies are coming up with **alternate distribution channels**.

**Direct Marketing** The insurance company gets a data base of potential customers, contacts them on the telephone to market different policies of the company. Companies are increasingly targeting customers of foreign banks as they are accustomed to tele marketing. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company sent 50,000 direct mailers to office-goers in Mumbai through their lunch boxes.

**Automobile Manufacturer Tie-ups** Non-life insurers have tied up with automobile manufacturers to provide 'free insurance' through their authorized car dealers for all new cars sold. Under the scheme of free insurance the insured does not pay the first premium but it is paid by the car dealer who is then compensated by the manufacturer.

**Forex Dealers** Large travel-related relationship services such as Thomas Cook and Western Union who have wide distribution networks are tapped by insurance companies to canvass and sell overseas travel insurance policies.

**Worksite Marketing** Insurance companies through their skilled marketing sell tailor-made insurance policies to individual employees of large organizations.

**Internet** Insurance companies sell products such as motor insurance, home insurance and personal accident insurance over the net.

**Departmental Stores/Retailers of White Goods** Insurance companies tie up with large departmental chains such as Shoppers' Stop or Westside to sell their products.

**Marine Cargo Insurance through Clearing and Forwarding (C&F) Agents/Transporters/Carrier Companies** Insurance companies provide these agents technology support which enables them to issue marine policies anywhere and anytime.

**INSURANCE MARKETING FIRMS (IMFs):** Insurance marketing firm is a new distribution channel to solicit or procure insurance premium, to distribute other financial products by employing individuals licensed to market, distribute and service such other financial products. Entities that are licensed as insurance marketing firms will be able to distribute insurance products along with mutual funds, pension products and certain other financial products such as banking/financial products of banks/ NBFC regulated by RBI; and non-insurance products offered by Department of Posts, Government of India, provided that permissions are in place to distribute those financial products from the respective regulator. In respect of general insurance, the IMF is allowed to solicit or procure only retail lines of insurance products as given in the file and use guidelines namely motor, health, personal accident, householders, shopkeepers and such other insurance products approved by the authority from time to time.

IMFs are permitted to distribute the insurance products of only two life insurers, two general insurers and two health insurers at any point of time, and changing the insurer whose products are to be distributed can only take place with the prior approval. IMFs are required to have a minimum capital of  $\bar{z}$ 10 lakh. They are also permitted to undertake survey functions through licensed surveyors on its rolls, policy servicing activities, and other activities which are permitted to be outsourced by insurers under the applicable regulatory framework. To safeguard the interests of customers, the remuneration of IMF salespersons is not commission-based but rather a fixed amount, with the option of a performance incentive.

**Insurance Web Aggregators:** It is also known as price comparison websites, have come up to enable the self-directed customers to perform product research function online. These entities compile and provide information about insurance policies of various companies on their website. Their primary motive is to provide accurate information to potential buyers. The role and duties of such aggregators are defined in detail in the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Web Aggregators) Regulations, 2013. In addition to enhancing transparency in the industry, web aggregators have made the whole process of decision making with regard to insurance products more convenient for busy buyers.

The IRDA took an initiative to develop a system, known as web aggregator, for comparison and distribution of insurance policies online. This initiative was taken for the benefit of prospective buyers' of the insurance policy keeping in mind developing trends in e-commerce. The IRDA initially issued guidelines in November, 2011 to enable enthusiastic entrepreneurs to leverage technological advancements to apply for license for comparison of insurance products of various insurance companies. Subsequently, it came out with IRDA (Web Aggregators) Regulations, 2013 and licensed web aggregators under the regulations. At present, there are 16 web aggregators.

**Point of Sales Person:** There are number of persons who are involved in undertaking simple and routine activities pertaining to solicitation and marketing of insurance policies for products in motor insurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance, etc., which require little underwriting as they are based on the information provided by the prospect and the insurance policy is automatically generated by the system. The intervention required for such a product is minimal and the training and examination for such persons could be of a lesser degree. In order to facilitate the growth of insurance business in the country and to enhance insurance penetration and insurance density, 'Point of Sales Person' can be sponsored by the insurance company or the insurance intermediary with whom he shall work to solicit and market only certain pre-underwritten products approved by the IRDA and who will undergo online training. Every 'Point of Sales Person' shall be identified by his Aadhaar Card Number or his PAN Card. The 'Point of Sales Person' shall be at least 10th pass.

The 'Point of Sales Person' can sell only the following pre-underwritten product. (a) Motor Comprehensive Insurance Package Policy for two-wheeler, private car and commercial vehicles, (b) Third party liability (Act only) Policy for two-wheeler, private car and commercial vehicles, (c) Personal Accident Policy, (d) Travel Insurance Policy, (e) Home Insurance Policy, (f) Cattle/livestock insurance, Agricultural Pumpset Insurance, Fire & Allied Peril Dwellings, Crop Insurance and Government Insurance Schemes

Like-wise motor insurance, personal accident insurance, cattle/livestock insurance, farmer's package policy and fire and allied peril dwellings insurance of general insurance, motor comprehensive, travel insurance, crop insurance and government insurance schemes have been approved by the IRDA.

**Insurance Repository:** To facilitate promotion of digital business and as a 'first of its kind' insurance service initiative in the world, the Insurance Repository System was introduced by the IRDA with the intention of improving services to policy holders as well as augmenting insurance penetration. This service allows subscribers to buy and store their policies in a dematerialized form (as e-policies). Beyond eliminating the risks of storage and loss, this facility provides convenience and safety to customers. Most importantly, e-policies are more economical to issue and service as compared to traditional paper policies. This feature could give a boost to the distribution and issue of low-ticket policies to marginal customers and thereby increase insurance penetration

### **Risk Management**

The term 'risk' is generally used to refer to a situation which bears a probability of some financial loss. It indicates uncertainty about a situation or a circumstance. However, it is only those circumstances or the part of a circumstance that bears the possibility of a 'loss', that is referred to as risk. Thus risk can be said to mean an uncertainty that has a likelihood of imposing some loss generally financial loss. Going further, in the insurance world, the term risk is used to refer to a property or an individual (in case of life insurance) insured. Technically the subject matter insured is called the 'exposure unit'. Risk is also used interchangeably with perils like fire, earthquake, explosion, etc. In fact, operation of perils involves the risk of loss. Again risk is also used to describe a hazardous situation like storage of inflammable material. Presence of a 'hazard' increases the risk of loss. Thus notwithstanding the context in which it is used, risk would mean simply 'a probability of loss'. Risk management as a branch of knowledge deals with entire gamut of issues relating to risks, starting from understanding the nature of risks and going up to methods of handling risks and financing risks. Risk management may be defined as the process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the resources and activities of an organization in order to minimize the adverse effects of potential losses at the least possible cost.

Increasing number of natural disasters, changes in demographic structure, volatility in financial markets, rapid growth of financial services, regulatory changes, information explosion, and de-tariffing of premium structures are just some of the factors aggravating the risk profile of insurance companies. They have come to terms with these changes and have started considering risk management as one of the strategic functions.
In addition to the pure risks of property, liability, and manpower, insurers have to counter certain risks peculiar to the business of insurance. These risks are: Portfolio risks, solvency risks, marketing risks, market risks, and operational risks.

- **Portfolio risks:** Portfolio for an insurer means the mix of business done by an insurer. For example, in case of life insurance, portfolio consists of term policies, endowment policies, unitlinked plans, etc. In case of non-life it could be fire, motor, health, etc. In order to optimize profitability, it is essential for an insurer to maintain the right balance in its business portfolio. Any distortion in portfolio is likely to expose the insurer to losses. Proper portfolio planning and constant monitoring and control over operations is the key to control this risk.
- **Solvency risks:** The more is the business of the insurer, the higher is the risk exposure in terms of expected losses. How much loss can an insurer bear on his own? This depends on the backup in terms of capital represented by assets of the insurer. This also involves valuation of outstanding liability in respect of policies issued by the insurer. In case of life insurance, such a valuation is done by actuaries. The capital has to be commensurate with the outstanding liability otherwise the insurer runs the risk of going insolvent in the event of huge losses. The IRDA has prescribed stringent norms in respect of capital adequacy to ensure that the risk of insolvency is addressed in right earnest. Thus with increase in business of an insurer, either the capital has to be raised or the excess risk exposure has to be transferred through reinsurance.
- **Marketing risks:** Insurance is a business of volumes and in order to reach out to the targeted segments of customers, marketing plays a pivotal role. Any change in demographic structure including consumer preference gives rise to marketing risks. Changes in demographic structure such as decrease in death rates, change in life styles and new killer diseases like SARS and AIDS have altered the demographic composition of the population. The rapid growth of financial services has led to development of more and varied alternate channels of distribution, tie-ups, and alliances. The deregulation of insurance industry has led to the entry of private sector players which in turn, has increased competition. A well-defined marketing strategy and positioning is critical to overcome all these risks.
- **Market risks:** Investment income is a crucial source of revenue for insurers. The revenue mix in insurance business is largely dominated by investment incomes. In order to maintain profitability, insurers have to be aggressive in investing their funds in high risk, high return securities which gives rise to market risk. The volatility in financial markets has made management of investible funds challenging. Market risk cannot be completely eliminated by diversification. Hedging tools like futures and options and prudent investment management help in mitigating this risk.
- **Operational risk:** Insurance is a service-intensive business. Policy and claims servicing are backbones of insurance business. These days in order to raise service standards, information technology is being used in operations in a big way. Centralized servers storing the entire data of the insurer and wider area networks (WAN) pose a definite operational risk while enhancing the service standards. Any accident or calamity of the server site can lead to a total breakdown of operations countrywide resulting in loss of business. Business continuity planning, remotely located proxy servers, proper back-up of data, and effective contingency plans are some of the steps towards operational risk management.

The insurance companies need to institutionalize risk management culture for successfully implementing risk management.

# **General Insurance**

General (non-life) insurance provides a short-term coverage, usually for a period of one year. General insurers transact fire insurance, motor insurance, marine insurance, and miscellaneous insurance business. Among these categories fire and motor insurance business are predominant. Motor vehicle insurance is compulsory in India and the motor insurance portfolio constitutes around 40 per cent of the total gross premium collected by the general insurance industry. Moreover, motor insurance due to third party liability claims has substantially contributed to underwriting losses.

The government nationalized the general insurance business on January 1, 1973, by passing the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972. Prior to nationalization, the general insurance business was concentrated in urban areas catering to the needs of trade and industry.

There are four nationalized and nine private sector general insurance companies. The government notified the General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) as an Indian reinsurer in November 2000. With

this, the four public sector companies which were subsidiaries of GIC have been delinked from it and are now broadly run as board-managed companies. The four public sector companies are: The Oriental Insurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company Limited, The National Insurance Company Limited, and The United India Insurance Company Limited.

**The Oriental Insurance Company Limited** The Oriental Insurance Company Limited (OICL) is one of the oldest insurance companies established in the year 1947. It was earlier known as The Oriental Fire and General Insurance Company Limited. It transacts all kinds of non-life insurance business, ranging from insurance covers for very big projects to small rural insurance covers. The company has 23 regional offices, 311 divisional offices, and 635 branch offices in various cities of the country. The company has overseas operations in Nepal, Kuwait, and Dubai. It has reinsurance connections spread all over the world.

The company was a pioneer in many areas and products. It was the first to start motor third party conciliating proceedings and front office computerization. In addition, it was the first to issue tailormade cover for cellular communication systems, directors and officers liability policy, advance loss of profits policy, a package policy under mega risk to PSU oil grants and underwrite the biggest grass root refinery project of Reliance at Jamnagar. It has designed special covers for large projects like power plants, petrochemicals, steel, and chemical plants.

**The New India Assurance Company Limited** The New India Assurance Company Limited was established by Sir Dorab Tata on July 23, 1919. New India was the first fully-owned insurance company in India which was set up to provide insurance protection to Indians. It was nationalized in 1973 with merger of over 23 Indian companies. It commenced overseas operations in 1920.

It has 26 regional offices, 397 divisional offices, and 688 branch offices. It commenced overseas operations in 1920. It has overseas presence in 27 countries like Japan, UK, Middle East, Fiji, and Australia. It has a network of 18 branches, 12 agencies, two associate companies, and two subsidiary companies. Its overseas premium was  $\overline{5937}$  crore in 2005–06, which accounted for more than 90 per cent of the total overseas premium in India. It has a strong operating performance and market position. It is one of the largest non-life insurer in the Afro-Asian region excluding Japan.

It is a pioneer among the Indian companies on various fronts. It was the first to set up an Aviation Insurance Department in 1946, to handle the hull insurance requirements of the Indian Shipping Fleet, to establish its own training school, to introduce the concept of 'model offices training', to create technical departments in Engineering, and to start satellite insurance—INSAT 2E.

**National Insurance Company Limited** National Insurance Company Limited (NIC) was incorporated in the year 1906. In 1972, 22 foreign and 11 Indian insurance companies were amalgamated with National Insurance Company Limited, Headquartered in Kolkata. NIC's network of over 964 offices with around 20,077 trained workers is spread all over the country. NIC has a strong presence in northern and eastern India. The company carries out its foreign operations from its branch offices in Nepal and Hong Kong.

It caters to the diverse requirements of more than 7.5 million policy holders by offering them more than 180 policies. It has paid a constant annual dividend to government at 25 per cent, amounting to `5,450 million, since nationalization.

National Insurance Company Limited ranks among the top global business insurers.

**United India Insurance Company Limited** Headquartered in Chennai, United India Insurance Company Limited is the second largest insurer by size of premium and market share. The company's major thrust areas are fire, marine, motor, and miscellaneous. It has a countrywide presence through a vast network of 22 regional offices, 313 divisional offices, and 789 branch offices, and manpower of 21,000 employees.

Two new public sector specialized entrants in the general insurance business are:

- Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd for crop insurance
- Export Credit Guarantee Corporation Limited for credit insurance

**Agriculture Insurance Company of India** A well-designed institutional arrangement such as insurance has to be put in place to avoid risks in agriculture, covering all farmers and crops. The Agriculture Insurance Company of India Limited was setup on December 20, 2002 under the Companies Act, 1956 with authorized and paid-up capital of  $\overline{\epsilon}1,500$  crore and  $\overline{\epsilon}200$  crore, respectively. NABARD'S contribution in the equity is 30 per cent, while the contribution from GIC is 35 per cent and 8.75 per cent each from four public sector general insurance comparable.

The Agricultural Insurance Company (AIC) has been granted a license on October 29, 2003, to transact crop insurance business. The NAIS scheme is now implemented by AIC. National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) is basically in the nature of group insurance schemes aimed at farmers taking crop loans from banks. The National Crop Insurance Scheme aims at providing insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the event of natural calamities, pests and diseases, besides encouraging the farmers to adopt progressive farming practices, high value inputs and higher technology in cultivation in order to help stabilize farm incomes, particularly in disaster years. The crop insurance has come under the purview of the Agriculture Insurance Company of India since October 2003. At present, the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) covers about 17 per cent of all farmers and 20 per cent of the cropped area. The Government is striving to increase the penetration by encouraging the States to bring more crops under crop insurance. The Government also directed the banks to insure all eligible crop loans under NAIS.

Agriculture Insurance Company of India Limited is the largest crop insurance provider in the world in terms of the number of farmers insured annually. AIC underwrites two types of insurance products:

**Government supported products**, viz., National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) where AIC is the implementing authority. The scheme provides risk insurance for yield losses due to natural fire, storms, drought, and pests diseases. The scheme covers food crops (cereals, millets, and pulses), oilseeds and annual commercial/annual horticultural crops (sugarcane, cotton, potato, onion, ginger, coriander, chilli, jute, etc). The total sum insured under the scheme is  $\overline{*}20,000$  crore, with premium income of  $\overline{562.32}$  crore.

The government has been designing need-based insurance products to cater to the specific needs of different farmers. These products are:

## **CROP INSURANCE**

**National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP):** It was introduced on 1st November, 2013 replacing National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS). NCIP has three component schemes, viz., Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS), Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) and Coconut Palm Insurance Scheme (CPIS).

**PRADHAN MANTRI FASAL BIMA YOJANA (PMFBY):** The scheme has been introduced on Kharif 2016 replacing National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) and Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and is being implemented by AIC and 15 other insurance companies.

PMFBY aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events, stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming, encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices, ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting farmers from production risks.

The scheme is available to all the farmers both, loanee and non-loanee irrespective of the size of their holding. The scheme envisages coverage of all crops including cereals, millets, pulses, oilseeds and annual commercial and horticultural crops in respect of which past yield data is available. As per provisions of PMFBY, insurance unit for major crops is village panchayat or other equivalent unit. Premium rates are actuarial supported by up-front subsidy in premium, farmers would pay premium of 2% in Kharif season, 1.5% in Rabi season for food crops and oilseeds and 5% for annual commercial horticulture crops. In case actuarial premium is less than above premium, actuarial premium will be paid by farmer. Balance between actuarial and capped premium would be payable by centre and state government equally. District-level crop-wise scale of finance would serve as basis of sum insured at which three levels of Indemnity, i.e., 70%, 80% and 90% would be applicable. Insurer is responsible for the claims liabilities

The scheme is implemented on an 'area approach basis'. The unit of insurance shall be village/village panchayat level for major crops and for other crops, it may be a unit of size above the level of village/village panchayat. The loss assessment for crop losses due to non-preventable natural risks is on area approach. In case of majority of insured crops of a notified area are prevented from sowing/planting the insured crops due to adverse weather conditions that will be eligible for indemnity claims up to maximum of 25% of the sum-insured. However, losses due to localized perils (Hailstorm, landslide & inundation) and post harvest losses due to specified perils, (Cyclone/Cyclonic rain & Unseasonal rains) shall be assessed at the affected insured field of the individual insured farmer. There will be a provision of on account claims in case of adverse seasonal conditions during crop season, viz., floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought, and unseasonal rains. On account payment up to 25% of likely claims will be provided, if the expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of normal yield.

**Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS):** Apart from the above two yield guarantee insurance schemes, the Government of India had introduced another scheme namely, Pilot Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) with effect from Kharif 2007, which became full-fledged scheme as a component of NCIP with its introduction. The scheme operates on an actuarial basis with premium subsidy which ranges from 25% to 50% equally shared by centre and states. AIC has implemented the scheme in various states during all previous Kharif and Rabi seasons starting Kharif 2007. WBCIS is a parametric insurance product designed to provide insurance protection to the cultivator against adverse weather incidence during the cultivation period, such as deficit and excess rainfall, frost, heat (temperature), relative humidity, wind speed, etc., which are deemed to adversely impact the crop yield.

Crops and 'Reference Unit Areas (RUA)' are notified before the commencement of the season by the State Government Each RUA is linked to a Reference Weather Station (RWS), on the basis of which payout/claims are processed. The payouts are made on the basis of adverse variations in the current season's weather parameters as measured at Reference Weather Station (RWS). Claim under WBCIS is area based and automatic. The Company insured more than 35 different crops including perennial crops like Apple, Citrus crops, Grapes, Mango, Pomegranate, Cashew nut, Oil palm, etc.

From Kharif 2016 onwards, WBCIS will be continued as restructured WBCIS wherein Farmers' Premium rate has been reduced to 1.5% to 2% for FCOS and 5% for ACH crops keeping all other parameters same.

1. Traditional and Named Peril Insurance Products such as potato insurance, bio-fuel tree/plant insurance and poppy insurance. Named Peril insurance policy is one which covers only those losses which arise on account of perils specifically listed in the contract. These products operate at individual farm level with losses being on individual basis.

AIC aims at providing financial security to person engaged in agriculture and allied activities through insurance products and other support services.

**Export Credit Guarantee Corporation** Credit plays a vital role in expanding export trade but it also increases the payment risks in export transactions. Hence the need for export credit insurance is felt. To fulfill this need, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) of India offers a range of credit risk insurance covers to exporters against loss in export of goods and services, guarantees to banks/financial institutions to enable exporters obtain better facilities, provides overseas investment insurance to Indian companies investing in joint ventures in the form of equity/loan. These schemes enable the exporters to develop their business, explore new markets and products, and get timely and adequate export finance. The Reserve Bank of India has permitted banks to write off in addition to claims settled by ECGC the out standing export bills settled by other insurance companies which are regulated by the IRDA. This directive of the RBI gives private insurance companies a large opportunity in this business and puts them on par with ECGC.

The private sector general insurance companies are:

- Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited
- Reliance General Insurance Company Limited
- IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company Limited
- TATA AIG General Insurance Company Limited
- Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited
- ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited

The minimum paid-up capital of the general insurance companies was raised to  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore under the modified Insurance Act. The four nationalized general insurance companies enhanced their paid-up capital from ₹40 crore to ₹100 crore.

The general insurance market is not as big as the life insurance market. While life insurance accounts for 81 per cent of the insurance market in India, general insurance accounts for the remaining 19 per cent.

# **General Insurance products**

**Fire Insurance** This covers the following:

- Building or flat.
- Furniture fixtures and other contents.
- Loss of profit, that is, consequential loss.

Fire insurance is a comprehensive policy which covers loss on account of fire, earthquake, riots, floods, strikes, and malicious intent. It can be taken only by the owner of the premises to be insured. A tenant cannot insure rented premises but he can insure the contents of the premises. Though fire insurance is not compulsory, lending institutions and housing finance companies insist on the premises being insured against fire. Fire rates were revised twice after nationalization, in 1979 and 1987. Fire insurance segment is the most lucrative as fire rates are governed by tariff. The competition is maximum in this segment. Bulk of the premium comes from corporate clients with large industrial assets. Fire insurance today accounts for a fifth of business for non-life insurance companies and brings in most of their profits.

**Motor Insurance** This covers the following:

- Various types of cars, trucks, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers.
- There are two types of motor insurance, namely:
- Third party insurance which only insures the party/parties other than the owner in an accident. It is mandatory for all registered vehicles plying on the Indian roads, under the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 which require every motor vehicle in a public place to insure against third party risk.
- Comprehensive insurance which insures the owner as well as the third party involved.

In motor insurance, the rates were revised upwards twice, once in 1982 and then in 1990 as the high cost of repairs coupled with third party claims had adversely affected the incurred loss ratio. Motor insurance is mandatory leading to good amount of premium collection but it is not being fancied upon as it could lead to litigation problem. Still, motor insurance is the single largest and the fastest growing business line for insurance companies. It accounts for over 40 per cent of the premium income of non-life insurance companies.The motor insurance segment was de-tariffed from January 1, 2007.

IRDA adopted a phased approach to detariffing in motor insurance.

- With a view to pre-empting a rate war in motor insurance, the regulator has asked companies not to offer vehicle cover at rates lower than 10 per cent of the tariff.
- If the companies want to offer higher discounts after January 2007, they would have to explain their pricing rationale.
- Insurers are allowed to marginally increase the rates for third party insurance.
- The third party premium would go into a special pool which will be managed by General Insurance Council and all claims will be paid out of this pool.
- If the premium in the pool is inadequate to meet all claims, the claims shortfall (losses) be shared by the insurers in proportion of their overall business size (market share).
- Insurance companies will receive 10 per cent of the premium as management expenses, while General Insurance Council will get 2.5 per cent for managing the pool.
- In the first phase, companies will issue policies and settle claims through their branches. The claims shortfall would be shared by the industry at the end of the year.

- Motor insurance constituted 47 per cent of the total industry premium (volume) during 2012–13.
- Motor insurance has two distinct covers: (i) Own Damage (ii) Liability to third party which is compulsory by law.

**Marine Cargo Insurance** This covers the following:

- Cargo in transit.
- Cargo declaration policy.

**Marine Hull Insurance** Inland vessels, ocean going vessels, fishing and scaling vessels, freight at risk, construction of ships, voyage insurance of various vessels, ship breaking insurance, oil and energy in respect of onshore and offshore risks, including construction risk. The IRDA removed the price control on insuring marine hulls from April 1, 2005. Now these classes of insurance come within the purview of the 'file and use' regulations, as applicable to non-tariff products. The marine hull portfolio is a  $\bar{x}400$ crore business and with detariffing, the competition among general insurers to offer cheaper prices will increase. As a result, the shipping industry will be the major beneficiary.

**Non-traditional/Rural** Cattle/hens, crop, water pump for agriculture, hut, other livestock.

Besides the traditional products, general insurers introduced longer term contracts such as deferred health insurance and project insurance including contractor's all-risk cover and the marine-cumerection risk cover and credit insurance.

At present only fire and motor insurance premium rate are governed the by IRDA while in case of marine, engineering and liability covers, the premium rates are determined through negotiation.

All classes of marine, hull insurance were de-tariffed with effect from April 1, 2005. With de-tarrifing, marine insurance now falls within the purview of the 'file and use' regulations, as applicable to non-tariff products of the IRDA. This measure will benefit large Indian shipping companies to negotiate and attract the best rates and select terms and conditions for themselves from the underwriters primarily because of the size of their fleets. This will result in lower insurance costs and improved operating efficiency, thus enabling Indian ship owners to compete internationally.

New products introduced by the non-life insurers include Mutual Fund Package Policy providing cover in respect of the assured's legal liability to third parties for claims towards financial loss caused by negligent act, negligent error or negligent omission on the part of an officer/employee; Third Party Liability and Asset Protection covers are available in respect of mutual fund covering their business operations; Pollution Liability Package Policy intended to cover damage costs of the insured due to slow and gradual pollution activities; Even Insurance Policy indemnifies the insured against the loss or damage due to cancellation of event. Weather insurance cover has been launched for the farming community, which suffers high losses year after year due to vagaries of nature. The specific products introduced by the insurers, which were aimed at the rural markets include Weather Insurance, Farm Income Insurance Scheme, *Varsha Bima* (rainfall insurance), and Farmers' Package Policy.

#### **Development of General Insurance**

British and other foreign insurance companies transacted general insurance business in India through their agents. Subsequently, they established their companies in India. The Triton Insurance Company Limited was the first general insurance company established in Calcutta in 1850. Foreign companies had a monopoly in the insurance business upto the close of the nineteenth century. The first Indian company to transact general insurance business was Indian Mercantile Insurance Company Limited in Bombay in 1907. In 1957, the General Insurance Council framed a code of conduct for insuring fair transactions of general insurance business. A Controller of Insurance was appointed to implement this code of conduct.

In 1956, insurers floated a reinsurance company, India Reinsurance Corporation Limited, for retention of the general insurance business in India. In 1961, the Indian Guarantee and General Insurance Company Limited, a government company along with India Reinsurance Corporation were notified as Indian reinsurers. The insurance companies voluntarily ceded to each of them 10 per cent of their gross direct premium. In 1961, the Government of India made it mandatory for every insurer to cede 20 per cent in fire and marine cargo, 10 per cent in marine hull and miscellaneous insurance, and 5 per cent in credit and solvency business to these two reinsurers.

In 1966, Indian reinsurance companies formed the Reinsurance Pools in Fire and Hull departments for retention of higher premiums in the country. The member companies ceded a specified percentage of premium to the respective pools which were managed by the two statutory reinsurers.

A number of insurance companies indulged in unfair practices and hence the Insurance Act was amended in 1968. This provided for regulation of investment of assets, setting up of the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC) under the chairmanship of the Controller of Insurance, minimum solvency margin, licensing of surveyors and payment of premium before commencement of risk. The general insurance business was concentrated in urban areas catering to the needs of trade and industry.

The government nationalized the general insurance business in 1972 by passing the General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972. One hundred and seven insurers including branches of foreign companies operating in India were amalgamated and grouped into four companies, namely, The National Insurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company Limited, The Oriental Insurance Company Limited, and The United India Assurance Company Limited. The General Insurance Corporation was incorporated as a holding company of these four companies in November 1972.

The general insurance industry in India is smaller than the life insurance industry. The total market size in annual premiums is about half that of life insurance. The general insurance industry in India has currently about  $\bar{\tau}$ 20,000 crore of premium income with a five year compounded annual growth rate in the 16 per cent range. The demand for general insurance is still generated by some form of mandatory or regulatory requirements. Motor vehicle insurance is compulsory and hence motor insurance premium dominates the total premium portfolio.

The growth of the general insurance business is hampered by lack of product innovation. Lack of quality data on risks and associated parameters handicaps product innovation.

## **Tariff Advisory Commitee**

The Tariff Advisory Committee is a statutory body created under the Insurance Act, 1938. The Tariff Advisory Committee looks into the pricing of non-life insurance products. The TAC determines the tariffs of the insurance industry except for marine cargo and various personal lines of business. The tariff mechanism provides floor rates for various products. It prevents uneconomic competition and facilitates classification of risks according to their special characteristics. The TAC has now been broad based with representatives from various faculties besides the insurance industry. It has revised fire insurance and engineering tariffs.

The TAC controls and regulates the rates, advantages, terms and conditions that may be offered by insurers in respect of general insurance business relating to fire, marine (hull), motor, engineering, and workmen compensation. With effect from May 1, 2000, a simplified fire tariff with a significant reduction in premium rates was introduced. Large risks where the threshold limit of probable maximum loss (PML) is  $\bar{\mathfrak{e}}1,054$  crore or above, at any one location, or where the sum insured at any one location is  $\bar{\mathfrak{e}}10,000$ crore or above have been de-tariffed. These risks are beyond the tariff regime and would be guided by rates available in the international markets, which are considerably cheaper than the tariff rates.

Moreover, these mega risks require customization of products which are not available in the Indian market. As a result, insurers can now issue comprehensive insurance package policies for mega risk on reinsurance driven rates, terms and conditions.

The tariff regime will be gradually phased out. In view of this, the IRDA has prepared a vision TAC document to spell out the future role of the TAC. The tariff advisory committee will perform the following functions:

- Collection of data on premium and claims, analysis of such data, and dissemination of the results to the insurers.
- Report to IRDA on the underwriting health of the market and any aberrations in market behaviour.
- Constitution of expert groups at the request of the General Insurance Council, to look into underwriting issues and recommend necessary action.
- Organize training of underwriters at the market level, and
- Attend to public grievances on non-availability of insurance and try to resolve the issues by discussion with insurers.

# **De-tariffing in Non-life Insurance**

Most of the non-life insurance business transacted in India was governed by tariffs. Tariffs are documents that prescribe the rates as well as policy coverage and conditions pertaining to a class of insurance. This had resulted in a very little room for competition in these areas. This also left very little incentives for rating better-managed risks, thus resulting in avoidable claim costs for the insurers. To add fuel to fire, features like adverse selection and moral hazard ensured that bottom lines of insurance always remained under pressure regardless of volume of business.

With effect from January 01, 2007 price restrictions from all tariff classes of business viz. motor, engineering, fire and workman's compensation were removed. However uniform pricing continued for • Tariffs are documents that prescribe the rates as well as policy coverage and conditions pertaining to a class of insurance.

• De-tariffing is pricing of insurance products driven by market forces.

motor third party risks for which a pool was created which was to be managed by GIC. In other words, insurers were allowed to rate the risk according to their own perception and experience instead of going by the fixed price mentioned in erstwhile tariffs. This opened up the price wars among the insurers and premium rates for profitable classes of business like fire and engineering have fallen substantially. Presently, the discount rates on the tariff rates for these classes range from 50 to 80 per cent. This development has been a boon in disguise for the consumers, particularly the industrial clients. For them the total outgo on insurance premium of their assets has gone down drastically. On the other hand, this has meant lower margins for insurers and lower commissions for intermediaries. Today after almost one and half years of price liberation insurers have got themselves divided into two broad categories. Those who have built substantial volumes established a sound customer base are going steady on discounts and are concentrating on picking up better risks in order to increase profitability. On the other hand, insurers who are relatively new in the market and are yet to establish themselves are concentrating on their toplines by offering heavy discounts. Price de-tariffing has also opened opportunities for public sector insurers to do their bit. They are huge entities with substantial reserves and thus can accumulate huge risks at a relatively cheaper price. Due to this, many of the large corporate accounts that had shifted to private sector insurers are now back with their old PSU insurers.

The second phase of de-tariffing was liberalizing policy wordings. The erstwhile tariffs not only specified the premium rates but also defined the coverage, exclusions and conditions for each product governed by tariffs. While de-tariffing the price, it was indicated by IRDA that full de-tariffing in respect of price as well as policy wordings will be done with effect from April 01, 2008. This was a crucial move since this would have meant that not only the insurers will be charging the price at their discretion but will also be able to customize the products as per the client's requirements. For this, the IRDA had requested the General Insurance Council to draft standard policy wordings for all tariff classes of business. The insurers on the other hand were requested to file the innovative products they wanted to sell as per the 'file and use' procedure. For this the insurers were required to carry out detailed actuarial exercise for rating and drafting the policy wordings.

However this did not happen as expected. While the General Insurance Council did draft standard policy wordings, very few insurers could file their products before the deadline. Carving out new products was a new thing for the industry and despite the enthusiasm the exercise turned out to be ticklish. On the other hand the market was under going heavy to very heavy discounting on tariff rates which left very little margin for innovation. The market was so used to tariff products that even from the demand side very little inclination was shown for innovation in product design. As a result the deadline of April 01, 2008 for full de-tariffing could not be met and as of now the decision to liberalize policy wordings has been put on hold.

Heavy discounting in price has, on the other hand, started showing results for insurers. Insurers have started feeling the heat of reduced price cushions in terms of exposed bottom lines. Prices have gone remarkably down but losses haven't. As a result, claims servicing has come under pressure and already there are unconfirmed reports of some insurers resorting to shoddy tactics for not paying claims.

### **General Insurance Council**

The Executive Committee of the Council comprises, of the nominees of IRDA [*viz*. Member (Non-Life) as Chairman and Executive Director (Non-Life) and the Secretary General of the Council], and the Chief Executive Officers of all the Non-life insurance companies licensed by IRDA. The Council organizes meetings of the Executive Committee, Chief Underwriters, Heads of Health Insurance Departments, CFOs, etc. from time to time.

The Council's mission is expanding and deepening non-life insurance penetration in India and promoting a responsible, responsive and disciplined pro-consumer service regime imbibing best global practices through a self-regulatory mechanism. The Council focuses on issues relating to: (a) promoting non-life insurance market; (b) promote consumer education and awareness of nonlife insurance products; and (c) development of intermediaries, *i.e.*, Agents and Brokers.

Further, the council puts forward the industry's view to the Government, IRDA, and other policy makers on problems confronting the industry as also to promote increased cohesion and cooperation between them. The Council also deliberates on ensuing level playing field between life and non-life insurers in Health portfolio and putting in places best global practices in the management of Health portfolio.

The functions of the General Insurance Council include aiding and advising the insurers carrying on general insurance business in the matters of setting up standards of conduct and sound practice and in the matter of rendering efficient service to holders of policies of general insurance The Council has helped in building up an integrated data base for dissemination of information to serve specific operational needs identified by the industry, address the issue of fraud against insurance companies and to identify areas of growth and develop solutions to common challenges faced by the insurance companies. The council has deliberated on issues relating to de-tariffing of the motor insurance business, review of the Motor Vehicles Act and structure of compensation/remuneration payable to agents.

During the year 2015–16, the existing General Insurance Council was reconstituted as the self regulating representative body of general insurance companies, health insurance companies and reinsurance companies. Further as per the Insurance Law Amendment Act, 2015 [Section 64F (2)], General Insurance Council has reconstituted the executive committee of the council to consist of four elected representatives amongst the members of the General Insurance Council elected in their individual capacity in such manner as may be laid down in the bye laws of the Council, an eminent person not connected with the insurance business, nominated by the authority, and four persons representing insurance agents, third party administrators',

Surveyors and loss assessors and policyholders to be nominated by IRDAI. As per Section 64 L (1)of the Insurance Act, the council has the following statutory functions:

- i. To aid and advise insurers, carrying on general insurance business, in the matter of setting up standards of conduct and sound practices and in the matter of rendering efficient service to holders of policies of general insurance.
- ii. To render advise to the authority in the matter of controlling the expenses of such insurers carrying on business in India in the matter of commission and other expenses.
- iii. To bring to the notice of the authority the case of any such insurer acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the holders of general insurance policies.
- iv. To act in any manner incidental or ancillary to any matters specified in clauses (i) to (iii) with the approval of the authority as may be notified by the council in the Gazette of India.

The current membership strength of the council is 30, viz., 4 public sector insurers, 18 private sector insurers, 5 standalone health insurers, two specialized insurers (AIC & ECGC) and India's National Reinsurer, and GIC Re.

## **Pattern of Investments**

The policy holders' money has to be invested judicially keeping in view liquidity, yield and safety.

Income received from investments is not only a key determinant in the calculation of premium rates but also compensates underwriting losses. Every insurer has to submit to the IRDA its investment policy before the start of an accounting year. The IRDA has mandated the pattern of investments to be followed by the insurance companies (Tables 16.2 and 16.3).

Every insurer in general insurance or the reinsurance business shall invest and at all times keep invested the total assets in the manner set out below.

All investments in assets/instruments which are capable of being rated shall be based on a rating by an independent recognized Indian or foreign rating agency.

## **Rural and social sector obligations for new entrants**

Provided that in cases where an insurance company commences operations in the second-half of the financial year and is in operation for less than six months as at March 31st of the relevant financial year (i) no rural or social obligation shall be applicable for the said period; and (ii) the annual obligations as indicated in the regulations shall be reckoned from the next financial year which shall be considered as the first year of operations for the purpose of compliance. In cases, where an insurance company commences operations in the first half of the financial year, the applicable obligations for the first year shall be 50 per cent of the obligations as specified in these regulations.

# **Maintenance of Solvency Margins of General Insurers**

Solvency margins are prescribed to ensure the ability of insurance companies to discharge liability to customers in time and in adequate measure. Just as the RBI prescribed a minimum capital adequacy ratio for banks, the IRDA has prescribed a minimum solvency margin requirement. This margin can be described as the ratio of free capital to the total business done by a company. If the losses are higher than what a company has set aside in its reserves for anticipated claims, then a company ends up paying claims out of its free capital which brings down a company's solvency ratio. If the solvency margin of an insurer declines, the regulator can ask the company to bring in additional capital. Every general insurer is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin of  $\overline{50}$  crore ( $\overline{100}$  crore in the case of a reinsurer) or a sum higher of RSM-1 and RSM-2 computed as under:

- RSM-1 means the Required Solvency Margin based on net premiums and shall be determined as 20 per cent of the amount which is higher of the gross premiums multiplied and the Net premiums.
- RSM-2 means the Required solvency Margin based on net incurred claims and shall be determined as 30 per cent of the amount which is the higher of the gross net incurred claims multiplied by a factor B and the net incurred claims.

In addition, at the time of registration all the new insurers have been required to maintain a solvency ratio of 1.5 times the normal requirements. All general insurers complied with the stipulated solvency ratio of 1.5. Funds to be set aside as reserves by General Insurance companies.

- General insurers are required to set aside funds towards claims under 'unexplored risks' and 'incurred but not reported' (IBNR) claims. These reserves are part of an insurance company's technical reserves and the funds are treated as policy holders' funds, Reserves for unexplored risks are funds set aside for claims under policies that continue to be valid even after the end of the financial year IBNR claim reserves are those created to meet claims that have taken place during the financial year but not reported to the company.
- IRDA has asked general insurers to create a new reserve for claims that have been 'incurred but not reported enough' (IBNRE) claims. This new reserve portions to claim that have been incurred during the year but the amount set aside by the company is lower due to lower reporting by the claimant.

## **Non-life Insurance Industry**

There are, at present, twenty seven players in the non-life insurance industry—six in the public sector and seventeen in the private sector. The four public sector undertakings—New India, United India, National Insurance and Oriental Insurance Companies are competing aggressively with these new players. These PSUs and two private insurers—ICICI Lombard General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insur• Solvency margin is an amount in excess of the value of insurer's assets over the amount of liabilities. This amount is prescribed by IRDA.

ance—account for 90 per cent of the non-life market. The non-life industry grew by 19.10 per cent during 2012–13. This growth was driven by health insurance and motor insurance. The number of policies underwritten by the private sector non-life insurance companies has steadily increased.

During the financial year 2012–13, the non-life insurers underwrote a premium of  $\overline{6}62,973$  crore recording a growth of 19 per cent. The private non-life insures witnessed higher growth of 25 per cent by underwriting premium to the tune of  $\overline{z}27,951$  crore. Non-insurance companies reported underwriting losses, higher incurred claims ratio and operating and management expenses. Despite these, they managed to register profits on account of higher investment income.

With increase in competition, new products have been introduced to expand the general insurance market. ICICI Lombard offered Indian farmers a newly designed product 'weather insurance'. This product was designed in association with the World Bank and micro finance institution—Basix. This product insures farmers against losses due to vagaries of weather relating to monsoons, humidity or temperature. Weather insurance does not suffer from the moral hazard and adverse selection problems. Also, the administrative costs are lower than those of traditional crop insurance. Thus, it is beneficial to both farmers and insurers. Moreover, it is easier for the insurer to transfer the risk to international financial markets through reinsurance. ICICI Lombard has executed around 90 weather insurance deals across 13 states and these deals have provided weather insurance solutions to about 2,00,000 farmers covering an area of about 2,50,000 acres.

With more joint ventures with foreign players and more innovations, the Indian investor will benefit. Branches and offices in the rural areas have been set up and rural sector products have been introduced by the non-life players. The non-life insurance companies are now focusing on retail business as opposed to corporate business. The nationalized companies have constituted an informal organization called General Insurance Public Sector Association (GIPSA) to suggest measures to expand the market coverage.

The year 2007 witnessed a switch over to a tariff free pricing regime for non-life insurance. This brought about hectic competition in pricing of non-life insurance products. However, only premium rates have been freed and that too subject to comprehensive underwriting exercise. Thus, while real competition will have to wait till full 'de-tariffing' it will be interesting to see how the industry responds to this limited deregulation.

### **Conclusion**

The current market share of private sector companies in the total business is 44.39 per cent which has also been growing steadily over the past few years. Motor insurance still continues to dominate the sector. Like life insurance the penetration of non-life insurance is also abysmally low at 0.78 per cent in 2012.

On account of high claim ratios for health (96.43 per cent) and motor(87.06 per cent) insurance coupled with a high operating cost ratio (21 per cent) profitability remains a concern for the non-life sector as well. The sector has not been able to generate underwriting profits since long and profits are generated only on the basis of non-core revenues like investment income. The sector has not been able to develop personal lines of business in a desired manner. Extending the out reach of insurance services to the low income segment still remains a challenge. All this proves that the Indian insurance sector is still far from attaining a sustainable growth level.

### **Health Insurance**

Human resource is the real wealth of a nation. An increase in national income does not always lead to human welfare. Economic development coupled with human development should be the primary objective of a nation. India is one of the success stories of globalization with an average GDP growth rate of 8 per cent since 2002–03. Despite high growth rate, it ranks 134 on human development index. The human development index provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development: living a long and healthy life, being educated and having a decent standard of living. India spends 4.8 per cent of GDP on health, of which the public health expenditure is 1.2 per cent of GDP and private health expenditure is 3.6 per cent of GDP. The total health expenditure per capita in India is USD 82. This is quite low in comparison to other developed and developing countries. On one hand, the country is gripped with communicable and non-communicable diseases resulting out of changing life styles, while on the other hand, health care costs are escalating making access to quality health care difficult. With

• Health insurance grew from ₹1002 crores to  $\overline{\text{56}}$ ,625 in terms of premium, a growth rate of 561per cent during the period 2002–03 to 2008–09. The average premium per insured person was  $\bar{z}$ 1,218 while the average claim size also was ₹1,218.

government expenditure on health declining, health insurance has emerged as an alternative mechanism for financing health care.

Health insurance, or health cover, is defined in the Registration of Indian Insurance Companies Regulations, 2000, as the effecting of contracts which provide sickness benefits or medical, surgical, or hospital expense benefits, whether in-patient or out-patient, on an indemnity, reimbursement, service, prepaid, hospital or other plans basis, including assured benefits and long-term care.

Both life and non-life insurers registered with the IRDA can transact health insurance business. Star Health and Allied Insurance Company is the first company to focus exclusively on health insurance. It offers health insurance as a stand alone product. Star Health is capitalized at  $\overline{\tau}105$  crore and has a non-life insurance license. It has a reinsurance arrangement with General Insurance Corporation (GIC). All claims below the claims ratio of 90 per cent will be picked up by GIC. IRDA has granted licence to three other insurance companies to operate as stand alone health insurance companies viz. Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co. Ltd., Max Bupa Heath Insurance Co. Ltd. and Religare Health Insurance Co. Ltd. All the companies have received certificate of registration to carry on general insurance business to underwrite exclusively in the health, personal accident, and travel insurance segment.

For stand alone health insurance contracts, expertise in health product design and pricing, and efficient claim settlement procedures are required.

The IRDA has encouraged both life and general insurance companies, old and new, to go in for rider policies offering health covers. Many new companies have gone in for riders offering a variety of health products. Riders are add-on benefits attached to the main life policy. To attract players to health insurance, life insurance companies will have no cap on health riders. While the relaxation has been given on the health riders, the 30 per cent cap on the premium of the base policy continues for other riders.

The general insurance industry has taken initiatives in standardising a uniform definition of 'Pre-Existing Diseases' and its exclusion wording . This uniform definition has come into effect from June 1, 2008. It is expected that such standardization of terminology will increase clarity of the insured by minimizing ambiguity in policy wordings and also help comparability of health insurance products across insurers.

#### **Health Insurance Policies**

Health policies available in India can be broadly classified in to:

Indemnity based—Mediclaim, health guard, healthwise, etc.—are the examples of indemnity based policies. These policies provide for re imbursement of expenses incurred necessarily as a direct result of hospitalization necessitated by a covered disease, illness or injury.

Benefit type-daily allowance, hospital cash, critical illness (standalone), or as a rider with the life insurance policy. Such policies provide for lump-sum payment on happening of an event insured against by the policy.

**(1) Standard Health Insurance Policy** Most of the health insurance policies available in the market provide cover against the risk of hospitalization. While this has been the basic structure of the product right since its inception in late 1980s, some changes have taken place as regards the fringe benefits and exclusions, with the advent of private players in the insurance market.

The operative clause of a standard health insurance policy offers to indemnify the insured against hospitalization expenses incurred by him at a hospital or nursing home upon the advice of a duly qualified medical practitioner as a result of an illness, disease or injury contracted during the policy period.

#### **(2) Reimbursement and Cashless Policies**

**Reimbursement policies:** This is the conventional method of indemnity in almost all non-life insurance policies. The insured initially bears all the expenses which is later on reimbursed by the insurance company, provided the claim is admissible as per the policy. Preliminary notice of claim with particulars relating to policy number, name of insured person in respect of whom claim is made, nature of illness/ injury and name and address of attending medical practitioner/hospital/nursing home has to be given by the insured to the Company within 7 days from the date of hospitalization.

In a reimbursement claim, although the insured gets his money eventually in the form of the claim proceeds, he has to shell out money initially to get treated. to some extent this defeats the very purpose • A rider is an additional benefit that is offered with the base policy at a nominal price.

- Health Insurance Policies:
  - Standard Health
  - Reimbursement and Cashless
  - Floater
  - Group Mediclaim
  - Cancer Medical Expenses
  - Health riders
  - Other Health Insurance covers

of insurance which is to provide monetary support at the time of peril. Due to this the industry went for a novel concept that has commonly come to be known as the 'cashless' system. This system has been in vogue in foreign countries and was replicated in India after the insurance sector was opened for private players.

**Cashless policies:** Cashless model of hospitalization is a novel concept in India that allows a policyholder to avail medical treatment at any of the network hospitals of the insurer without paying cash. Insurers have a panel of third party administrators (TPAs), who typically offer services across cities. Thus, a TPA is a point of contact for a settlement of claims. They facilitate the smooth operation of a health cover by acting as a link between the insurance companies and their clients and hospitals. They enable cashless payment of claims to the insured wherein they settle claims with hospital instead of insurers. The hospital bills are paid by the TPA directly to the hospital, thus relieving the insured from the hassle of arranging funds in the event of a major hospitalization.

**(3) Floater Policy** This is again a new feature introduced post-liberalization. As per the standard health insurance product, separate sums had to be specified for each member of the family even in cases where the entire family was opting for insurance. While a common policy was issued, specific sum insured was to be mentioned against the names of each member. This system ignored the internal diversification of risk among the family and the consequent risk reduction. Since standard premium rates were being applied to all family members, every member was considered to be an independent exposure unit. However in reality, the probability of all family members in a family falling ill in a single year is very low. Due to this phenomenon, people used to either exclude their family members from coverage or go for a lesser sum insured for spouse and children. As a matter of fact, where the working member of a family is a male, the probability of him falling ill is more than his spouse and children. Due to this indirect adverse selection, insurers were deprived of the benefit of internal diversification in terms of reduced loss frequency.

A family floater policy attempts to solve all these aberrations. This policy provides for a common sum insured for the entire family. The sum insured or the coverage amount can be used for the principal insured or together for the family members. Thus, having a family floater would imply that the entire family could claim up to the sum insured amount during the policy period. Technically, a family floater policy considers the family as a single exposure unit as against the individual family members. Because of this the premium chargeable for a family floater policy is much less than a conventional policy with individual sum insured. Due to the reduced premium more families are attracted to buy this policy. On the other hand since entire family is covered, the scope for adverse selection within the family is eliminated.

**(4) Group Mediclaim Policy** The Group Mediclaim policy is available to any Group/Association/ Institution/Corporate body of more provided it has a central administration point and subject to a minimum number of persons to be covered.

The coverage under the policy is the same as under Individual Mediclaim with the following differences:

- 1. Cumulative bonus and Health Check up expense are not payable
- 2. Group discount in the premium is available
- 3. Renewal premium is subject to Bonus/Malus clause.
- 4. Maternity benefit extension is available at extra premium.

**(5) Cancer Medical Expenses Insurance Policy** Two types of policies are devised for covering medical expenses in relation to treatment of cancer. One policy is available to members of Indian Cancer Society and another one for members of Cancer Patients Aids Association.

**(6) Health Riders Under Life Insurance** Health insurance is a common area between life and non-life insurance. In fact the regulatory framework for insurance companies encourages them to launch health insurance products. In developed insurance markets, health insurance is the exclusive domain of life insurance companies. In India, unfortunately life insurers have not shown much keenness towards standard health insurance. The IRDA has encouraged both life and general insurance companies, old and new, to go on for rider policies offering health covers. Riders are addon benefits attached to the main policy. In most cases whatever is offered in form of 'health riders' is nothing but critical illness or hospital daily cash allowance covers. The indemnity cover providing

• The introduction of cashless servicing of claims under the mediclaim policies in 2001 fuelled the growth of health insurance.

for reimbursement of hospitalization expenses is nowhere to be seen. The salient features of health riders available with life insurance policies are summarized below:

- This rider is added to a life insurance policy to protect the insured in the event of a **critical illness.**
- Generally, the **extra cover is equal to the sum assured** on the base policy and is paid upon diagnosis of the illness.
- The plan is also renewable till the age of 65 years, without any medical examination, with premiums increasing only once in every five years.
- While the **illnesses covered and the premiums vary among insurers**, most insurers cover cancer, coronary artery bypass, heart attack, kidney/renal failure, major organ transplant, and paralytic stroke.
- Before adding this rider one must check illnesses covered and the exclusions.
- And, **a few insurers terminate the base policy once a claim is made on the rider**. Thus, a plan that continues to give you life cover, at marginally higher premium on the rider, is preferable.
- Under a Critical Illness policy, the amount of insurance has to be selected by the client. It is at 4 levels—₹5 lakhs, ₹10 lakhs, ₹20 lakhs, and ₹25 lakhs.
- The premium paid for this rider qualifies for **tax deduction under section 80D** of the IT Act.

**Other health insurance covers** The health insurance vanilla products provide only for the expenses wholly and necessarily incurred due to disease, illness or injury covered under the policy. But, the exclusions contained there in create the biggest gap in the cover by omitting from the scope of cover pre-existing disease and conditions, and limiting the cover for payment of pre-hospitalization expenses up to 30 days and post-hospitalization expenses up to 60 days (this period may differ from product to product). Even congenital diseases and defects, whether known or not known are excluded from the scope of cover. It is estimated that in any hospitalization the percentage of direct (hospitalization) expenses and indirect or incidental expenses is in the ratio of 65 and 35, which clearly indicates the gap that exists in the coverage under a standard health insurance policy. Thus it is evident that many gaps are still there in the standard health insurance covers available in the market waiting to be addressed.

Health is of the prime concern not only for a person but also for the society as ideally the health insurance should not limit itself to the expenses or the pecuniary losses sustained by a person. Health insurance needs to have a holistic view to address not only the loss aspect but to actively engage in the prevention of the prevalence of diseases. The national goal of health for all can only be achieved by congruence of all the state, the agencies, stakeholders on a common platform to ensure affordable, transparent and accountable healthcare to the whole society. It is not that no steps have been taken in that direction, but either it was early or they did not get the right vehicle to reach the masses. The insurers have tried to bridge the gap by several permutations, combinations in an effort to provide better coverage. Separate benefit type covers like hospital cash (daily allowance), critical care, and overseas travel insurance have been introduced. Low budget health insurance schemes like Jan Arogya, Universal health insurance were introduced at the government's behest. Nagreek Suraksha—a combination of Personal Accident and Injury related hospitalization is available in the market, so is Rasta Aapati- a personal accident and road accident triggered hospitalization cover.

**Hospital Cash policies** The private players, in a bid to gain entry in to the health insurance market, came out with innovative products to address the growing need for increasing the options for more depth in coverage. One of the first Hospital Cash or Daily Allowance policies was launched in the year 2001. The need for this policy was felt as the regular policy/ies did not cover the increased financial burden caused by hospitalization of a family member. The policy aims to provide cover against the additional expenses such as, transport, lodging and boarding, charges levied by the hospital for attending family member, hiring of personal attendant, etc. This cover is available as standalone cover with some companies and as an in-built benefit in the health insurance cover with others. It should always be taken as an addition/ extension of the regular health insurance rather than being considered as a substitute.

The policy provides for cash allowance per day ranging from  $\overline{500}$  to  $\overline{55,000}$  per day in case of hospitalization due to disease, illness, or injury suffered by the insured person. For this purpose hospitalization means a continuous stay in the hospital as an in-patient for 24 hours. Certain policies have provisions for paying twice the daily limit per day in case of admission in ICU or ICCU for a period not exceeding seven days. The cover can be taken for the entire family, *i.e.* the proposer, spouse and dependant children in the age band of 3 months to 21 years.

**Critical Illness covers** (a) In the contemporary work environment which exerts very high stress levels coupled with more materialistic lifestyle, the prevalence of lifestyle diseases is very high. We have grown more accustomed to luxuries that offer all the comforts and overall our lives have become more sedentary. The result is that India is fast becoming the world capital of Diabetes and Cardio-vascular diseases. Even the cancer prevalence is very high in India.

The onset of critical illness does not come alone, *i.e.*, medical and hospitalization expenses, but can also have an adverse effect on the persons life in many ways. It can result into: (1) temporary loss of income; (2) reduced mobility affecting the quantum of income; (3) necessity to modify the house; (4) need for constant and specialized attention in certain cases. These and the other financial implications associated with the persons ability to work as he used to before being afflicted with the life threatening disease such as Heart Attack or Cancer can be suitably addressed by way of a Critical Illness policy. Although these are considered life threatening, the modern medical science has been able to help patient survive, if treated proactively. Thus critical illness cover should be viewed as a tool by which people affected get the necessary financial support to better manage their changed circumstances of life.

The critical illness cover provides for a lump sum payment on the onset of the listed diseases. The number of diseases covered varies according to the market and the provider. depending upon the type of policy the number of diseases covered may vary from 5–35 in the policies available in the Indian market.

There also are some disease specific policies like cancer insurance, diabetes insurance, available in the market. The basic critical illness policy covers the following listed diseases: (1) Cancer; (2) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft/Surgery; (3) First Heart Attack; (4) Kidney Failure; (5) Major Organ Transplant (as a recipient); (6) Stroke.

The critical illness policies are sold either on standalone basis or as a rider to the Life insurance policy, hence, there are some basic differences in the sense that the standalone critical illness policies marketed by the non-life companies are single year policies whereas the plans sold by the life companies are long term plans. In both the types the operative part is that the benefit under the policy accrues on the positive diagnosis of the existence of the listed disease and survival following the diagnosis for a stipulated period which varies according to the plan and the provider but is usually 30 days.

**Jan Arogya Bima Policy** The Mediclaim policy was launched in the year 1986. Initially the scheme was based on categories with fixed benefits under various heads. Later on the same was changed to Sum Insured based and cover was offered from  $\overline{515,000}$  to  $\overline{53,00,000}$  in multiples of  $\overline{55,000}$ . It was argued that the premium was very high and that the weaker sections of the society could not afford such high premiums. Low levels of penetration were also attributed to this reason. The General Insurance Corporation of India introduced Jan Arogya Bima policy in the year 1998, a toned down version of the Mediclaim policy.

As the scheme is based on the structure of Mediclaim, the terms, conditions and exclusions are similar to the basic policy. The scheme can be differentiated by its only feature which does not provide for either the cumulative bonus or the free health check-up feature available under the regular Mediclaim policy. The coverage is available to individual or for the entire family on the line of the basic policy. The sum insured per person is limited to  $\overline{$}5000$ . A very salient feature of the policy was that there was no agency commission payable and the policy was intended to be sold through NGO's, government agencies, selfhelp groups and such other organizations. The premium for the scheme is as low as  $\overline{z}70$  for adult male or female and  $\text{\textless}50$  for the dependant son/daughter up to the age of 25 years. As the scheme was supposed to be sold directly without intermediary and as the companies did not have the focus or will for direct marketing, it did not take off as desired.

**Community-based Universal Health Insurance Scheme** The scheme offers health protection and easy access to good health services to the weaker sections. It was announced in the Union Budget 2003–04 and the responsibility for implementing it is given to the New India Assurance Company Ltd. Under this scheme, a premium of  $\bar{\tau}1$  per day for an individual,  $\bar{\tau}1.50$  per day for a family of five (including the first 3 children) and  $\bar{\tau}2$  per day for a family of seven (including the first 3 children and dependent parents) will entitle eligibility to get reimbursement of medical expenses up to  $\overline{30,000}$  towards hospitalization, a cover for death due to accident up to  $\overline{25,000}$  and compensation due to loss of earning at the rate of ₹50 per day up to a maximum of 15 days after a waiting period of 3 days. For below-poverty line (BPL) families, the government will contribute  $\bar{\tau}100$  per year towards their annual premium.

Many states have recently initiated large scale health insurance programmes in association with nonlife insurers to protect their vulnerable groups from such health-related financial needs. Some prominent schemes are Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme in AP, and the centrally-sponsored Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) which has been launched in many states across the country.

**Nagrik Suraksha Policy** An accidental insurance cover providing compensation for accidental injuries and/or reimbursement of expenses incurred at hospital as a result of accidental injuries subject to limits. This cover is for any citizen of India in the age group of 5 years to 70 years for family package and 18 years to 70 years for individual/group cover. The term for cover of individual policies range between one year to four years and for group policies—12 months. The minimum sum insured is  $\overline{\tau}1$  lakh and maximum is  $\overline{\epsilon}5$  lakhs with an option of enhancement of minimum limit of sum insured in multiples of  $\overline{$}25,000/$ - upto a maximum of ₹5,00,000.

**Personal Accident Policy** This policy offers compensation in case of death or bodily injury to the insured person, directly and solely as a result of an accident, by external, visible and violent means. The policy operates worldwide and is a 24 hours cover. It provides comprehensive cover covering death, permanent disablements and temporary total disablements. Family Package cover is available to individuals whereby the proposer, spouse and dependent children are covered under a single policy Group personal accident policies are also available for specified groups.

**Overseas Medical Insurance** All the health covers, which provide for the hospitalization expenses, are bound by the geographical limits of India. Hence, any person traveling out of India and contracting any illness or disease or sustains injury, can not claim under his health insurance for the expenses incurred out of India. To address this anomaly and looking to the increasing foreign travel undertaken by Indian Public in the wake of liberalization of Indian economy, the need for overseas medical insurance was felt. This policy covers medical expenses whilst traveling abroad for business/holiday/employment/studies. The premium payable is in rupees and claims settled abroad are in foreign currency. As the number of persons traveling abroad has increased, this segment has become lucrative for the insurers.

**Tax benefits** In order to cover a large number of people in the health insurance net, there are tax benefits available under Section 80D. Medical cover premium is tax-deductible up to  $\bar{\tau}$ 15,000, with an additional deduction of up to  $\overline{5,000}$  if the policy is in the name of a senior citizen (65 years or older) and the premium is paid by him. If someone below 65 buys a plan for his dependents, he can avail benefit upto  $\overline{515,000}$ . Mediclaim policies attract tax benefits under Section 80D. Deduction under this section is available if the premium is paid by cheque. The maximum amount of deduction available under this section is  $\overline{515,000}$ . This limit stands enhanced to  $\text{\textless}20,000$  in case an individual is a senior citizen. Tax benefits are also available in case individuals pay for their parents and children who are dependant on them.

# **Conclusion**

Health insurance is the fastest growing segment in the non-life insurance industry in India. The premium from health insurance products grew from  $\overline{6675}$  crore in 2001–02 to  $\overline{55,100}$  crore in 2007–08. It is also emerging as an increasingly significant line of business for life insurance companies, and many prominent life insurance companies now have health insurance products.

There is rich potential in the health insurance market. The insurance companies have been unable to exploit the potential of the health insurance market due to factors such as lack of awareness of the need, nonviability of the stand alone health insurance businesses at  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore equity, and a supply and demand mismatch, where quality hospitals are few on account of high infrastructure costs.

The growth of heath insurance in India is sluggish looking to its mammoth potential. Ideally, health insurance should be the first thing to come to one's mind after life insurance. But it is bought only when it is urgently pressing. There is a general tendency of people to buy heath insurance after they reach middle age. Moreover, in an Indian family, it is usually the head of the family, or the breadwinner, or person most prone to disease who is proposed for insurance or a higher sum insured. These features lead to the building of a skewed health portfolio instead of healthy portfolio. Besides, delay in claims settlement and customer dissonance on account of exclusion of pre-existing diseases have led to customer reluctance in buying the product. Large amount of claims on account of inefficient underwriting have limited the number of stand-alone players in the health insurance market. The overall claims incidence is a whopping 6.36 per cent which is too high for health insurance. The average claim size is about  $\bar{\tau}$ 19,000. The incurred claims ratio is the highest among all the segments of non-life insurance business. The age bracket of 41–60 years ended up with highest number of claims. The absence of actuarial support and credible database on health trends of sufficiently large demographic samples coupled with non-standardization of healthcare costs have made it difficult to control claims costs. Heath insurers need to design proper pre-acceptance medical exams backed by actuarial rating to avoid high cost of claims.

• The claims ratio is around 6.4 per cent which means that in a group of 1000 health insured people, only 64 claims are lodged. As the health claims ratio is 100 per cent, 6.4 per cent of claimants take away 100 per cent of the insured money.

The government is planning to substantially relax the entry norms, including paid-up capital requirement. The minimum capital requirement for health insurance companies is expected to be slashed from the current level of  $\overline{5100}$  crore to around  $\overline{525}$  to 30 crore. Currently, health insurance comes under the scope of general insurance. A separate classification is proposed for insurance companies to distinguish them from life and non-life insurance business.

With barely 3.27 crores people (less than 3per cent of the population) covered, health insurance commands a humble share in the business transacted by non-life insurers. Notwithstanding this nano-presence, health insurance has had a much larger share in associated controversies. Whether it is the pathetic service offered by some Third Party Administrators (TPAs) or hike in premium for higher age brackets by some insurers, health insurance always tends to remain in the news. The real malaise however lies in the fact that a highly regulated insurance industry is struggling against a much bigger and highly organized but unregulated healthcare industry. Also, the insurers have failed to promote the concept of insurance in right earnest and introduce products that induce people to buy health insurance at young age. However, with TPAs aggressively negotiating with hospitals in an effort to ensure standard treatment protocols and standardized cost structures on one hand and the expanding outreach of health insurance on the other have made it a commercially viable proposition. A comprehensive healthcare regulation can increase the pace of growth of health insurance.

# **Reinsurance**

• Reinsurance is insurance for direct insurance companies. In insurance, the insured transfers his risk to the insurer. This primary insurer transfers a part or all of the risks he has insured to another insurer to reduce his own liability (the risk that he has assumed). This is known as reinsurance. Reinsurance is primarily an insurance of risks assumed by the primary insurer known as the ceding company. This risk is shifted to another insurer known as the reinsurer. The ceding company may shift part or all of the insurance originally written to the reinsurer. The amount of the insurance retained by the ceding company for its own account is called the retention. Retention is the amount of risk that an insurer is prepared to take on his own account. The amount of the insurance ceded to the reinsurer is known as the cession. The proportion of risk to be retained by the ceding company depends on factors such as company's assets and investment income, portfolio of the risks premium levels, inflation, and reinsurance market conditions. Reinsurance operates on the same principle as direct insurance, *i.e.*, to spread sharing of risks as widely as possible. The insurers seek protection of their own risk by reinsuring with reliable reinsurers. Reinsurance evolved as a natural corollary to insurance. Reinsurance is used for several reasons:

- To increase the company's underwriting capacity which, in turn, would help to render improved service to the reinsured and expand the market.
- To spread the risks with as many insurers as possible.
- To obtain valuable advice and assistance with respect to pricing, underwriting practices, retention, and policy coverages.
- To stabilise profits by leveling out peak risks/losses.
- To provide protection against catastrophic losses arising due to natural disasters, individual explosions, airline diasters and so on.
- To retire from the business or class of business or territory.

The reinsurance business assumes greater importance in the event of war and natural calamities when the smaller insurance firms find themselves unable to take on the full risk due to their lower capital base.

Figure 16.3 provides an overview of reinsurance.

## **Types of Reinsurance**

There are two types of reinsurance: (i) Facultative and (ii) Treaty.

#### *1. Facultative Reinsurance*

• Facultative reinsurance is reinsurance of large individual risks.

Facultative reinsurance is a reinsurance in which the reinsurer can accept or reject any risk presented by the ceding company (insurance company seeking reinsurance). This means that it is not mandatory for the reinsurer to accept the cover and he will accept it after naming his price terms and conditions. The reinsurer has the freedom to reject sub-standard risks if it so desires. The reinsurer retains the flexibility

**Figure 16.3** Reinsurance: Type, Method, and Structure

to accept or reject each application for reinsurance. The ceding company also gets freedom in respect of the portions of the risk to be reinsured and the choice of the reinsurer. Before underwriting any insurance, the ceding company determines whether reinsurance can be obtained. It contacts several reinsurers and if a willing reinsurer is found, both (ceding company and reinsurer) enter into a valid contract. The ceding company must disclose full information relating to the risk concerned to ensure validity of the contract. Facultative insurance offers several advantages such as increasing flexibility and the underwriting capacity of the ceding company. It is frequently used when a large amount of insurance is to be written. It stabilises the insurer's profits by shifting large losses to the reinsurer.

However, it creates a sense of insecurity as the ceding company may not always be successful in insuring its business. This uncertainty leads to a delay in the issue of policy. Facultative reinsurance is used to cover large individual risks such as car factories, large departmental stores and product liability for pharmaceutical firms.

#### *2. Treaty Reinsurance*

Treaty reinsurance means the ceding company is obliged to cede and the reinsurer is obliged to accept an agreed share of all reinsurance of the type defined in the contract. Treaty insurance is automatic and certain as business that falls within the scope of the agreement is automatically reinsured, according to the terms of the treaty. The ceding company has not to shop around for reinsurance before the policy is written. This system is beneficial also to reinsurers as they are assured of a regular flow of business. However, reinsurers could incur losses if the ceding company writes bad business or charges inadequate rates.

**Reinsurance Treaties** Reinsurance treaties can be of different types such as quota-share treaty, surplusshare treaty, excess-of-loss treaty, and reinsurance pool.

Under a quota-share treaty, the ceding company and the reinsurer agree to share a fixed proportion of premium and losses. The ceding company retains, for its own account, a certain percentage of such risk. In other words, the ceding company's retention limit is stated as a fixed percentage. This treaty is popular among new and unknown insurers.

Under a surplus-share treaty, the reinsurer agrees to accept insurance in excess of the retention with the ceding company upto some maximum amount. The ceding company has complete discretion in respect of retention. The ceding companies which are financially sound can afford to have substantial retentions. The premiums and losses are shared based on the fraction of total insurance retained by the ceding company and the reinsurer.

Under an excess-of-loss treaty, losses in excess of the retention limit are covered by the reinsurer upto some maximum limit. It is a blanket agreement where all the claims made on local companies, above a certain limit, are reimbursed by the reinsurers. This treaty is useful for protection against catastrophic • Treaty reinsurance is reinsurance of specified types of risks that are automatically ceded and accepted.

losses. At the beginning of every financial year, non-life insurance companies have to renew their excess of loss reinsurance treaties in the international market.

A reinsurance pool is a pool of reinsurers who jointly underwrite insurance as it may not be possible for a single insurer alone to write large amounts of insurance. Huge exposure arise in nuclear power and aviation which cannot be underwritten by a single insurance and reinsurance company and hence a reinsurance pool reinsures the risk.

Both facultative and treaty reinsurance may be either proportional or non-proportional in type. In proportional reinsurance, the direct insurer, and reinsurer divide premiums and losses between them at a pre-determined ratio. Proportional treaty insurance offers direct insurer protection against major deviations such as risk of random fluctuation, risk of change due to economic cycles, new laws and regulations, or social change. With non-proportional reinsurance, there is no contractually defined ratio for dividing losses and premiums between the direct insurer and reinsurer. Non-proportional treaty insurance offers direct insurer cover for catastrophe risk such as windstorm, earthquake and flood as well as large road, aviation and marine accidents.

The pricing and terms and conditions of a reinsurance contract are based largely on the underwriting capacity in the international market.

The two largest reinsurance companies Munich Re and Swiss Re, have combined stock market value of USD 50 billion (£33 billion) and are seen as bell-wethers for the reinsurance industry. Munich Re has its presence in India through two ventures with Paramount Healthcare who are in the business of third party administration and healthcare management.

# **Reinsurance Business in Life and General Insurance**

Reinsurance of the life insurance business is less complex as compared to the general insurance business. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has the financial strength and capacity to absorb risks fully. The number of life policies reinsured as well as the total sum of risk reinsured is quite insignificant.

The need for reinsurance is higher in the case of general insurance as it involves complex risks. In the post-independence period, Indian general insurers obtained the reinsurance cover from foreign reinsurance companies. This led to a drawing of foreign exchange. Hence, to maximize retention and to minimize the drain of foreign exchange, the general insurance business was nationalized.

In 2000, the outgo of premium money by way of reinsurance was around  $\bar{\tau}10$  billion. In order to increase the retention of premia in India, the role of General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) was reinforced as the official reinsurer by making an obligatory cession of 20 per cent of insurance business by the private insurance companies, written in India, to GIC. This percentage was reduced to 15 per cent for the financial year 2007–08 and 10 per cent for 2008–09. IRDA has notified that the percentage cessions of the sum insured on each general insurance policy to be reinsured with the Indian reinsurer shall be 5% in respect of insurance during the year 1st April, 2016 to 31st March, 2017 (except for government sponsored health insurance schemes, wherein it would be made 'NIL').

The IRDA has also issued regulations relating to both life and non-life reinsurance in 2000. To develop domestic reinsurance market capacity, the IRDA stipulated that insurers should offer an opportunity to other Indian insurers to participate in facultative and treaty surpluses before placement of such cessions outside India.

### **Life Insurance-Reinsurance Regulations, 2000**

- Every life insurer shall draw up a programme of reinsurance in respect of lives covered by him.
- The profile of such a programme, which shall include the name(s) of the reinsurers with whom the reinsurer proposes to place business shall be filed with the authority (IRDA) at least forty-five days before the commencement of each financial year, by the insurer. Provided that the authority may, if it considers necessary, elicit from the insurer any additional information, from time-totime, and the insurer shall furnish the same to the authority forthwith.
- The authority shall scrutinize such a programme of reinsurance as referred to in Sub-regulation (2) and may suggest changes, if it considers necessary, and the insurer shall incorporate such changes forthwith in his programme.
- Every insurer shall retain the maximum premium earned in India commensurate with this financial strength and volume of business.
- The reinsurer chosen by the insurer shall enjoy a credit rating of a minimum of BBB of Standard and Poor or equivalent rating of any international rating agency.
Provided that placement of business by the insurer with any other reinsurer shall be with the prior approval of the authority, provided further that no programme of reinsurance shall be on an original premium basis unless the authority approves such programme.

Provided further that no life insurer shall have a reinsurance treaty arrangement with its promoter company or its associate/group company, except on terms which are commercially competitive in the market and with the prior approval of the Authority, which shall be final and binding.

Every insurer shall submit to the authority statistics relating to its reinsurance transactions in such forms as it may specify, together with its annual accounts.

LIC traditionally reinsures a small component of its business and it ceded  $\overline{$87.95}$  crore during 2007– 08 as reinsurance premium . Similarly, private insurers reinsured a small component of the business with group business forming the major component of the reinsurance cessions. The private insurers together ceded  $\bar{\tau}$ 231.23 crore as premium towards reinsurance.

# **Non-life Reinsurance Regulations**

The IRDA has constituted the Reinsurance Advisory Committee consisting of five persons having special knowledge and experience of business of reinsurance. The Reinsurance Advisory Committee has pegged the compulsory cession to the Indian reinsurer by the insurers carrying on general insurance business at 10 per cent subject to limits in fire, engineering, and the energy business. Cessions in respect of public and product liability business have also been pegged at 10 per cent on a quota share basis without any limits. The committee has also specified commissions and profit commissions for each class of business besides outlining the procedures for maintenance and settlement of accounts. Profit commissions shall be applicable on the aggregate results of statutory cessions portfolio at the rate of 20 per cent.

- Every insurer who wants to write inward reinsurance business shall adopt a well-defined policy for underwriting inward reinsurance business. The reinsurance programme of every insurer should have the approval of its Board of Directors.
- An insurer shall ensure that decisions on acceptance of reinsurance business are made by persons with adequate knowledge and experience, preferably in consultation with the insurer's appointed actuary.
- An insurer shall file with the authority, at least 45 days before the commencement of each financial year, a note on its underwriting policy indicating the clauses of business, geographical scope, underwriting limits, and profit objective. The insurer is further required to file the treaty slips or cover notes relating to the reinsurance arrangements with the Authority within 30 days of the commencement of the financial year. These measures highlight the existence of adequate and efficient reinsurance arrangements for an insurer because its solvency is assessed on a 'net of reinsurance' basis.

The Regulations require that every insurer should maintain the maximum possible retention commensurate with its financial strength and volume of business. The IRDA has issued the necessary directions for the reinsurance programme of every insurer.

They are:

- The reinsurance programme of every general insurer, carrying on general insurance business, shall be guided by the following objectives:
  - To maximize retention within the country.
  - To develop adequate capacity.
  - To secure the best possible protection for the reinsurance costs incurred.
  - To simplify the administration of business.
- Every insurer shall offer an opportunity to other Indian insurers, including the Indian reinsurer to participate in its facultative and treaty surpluses before placement of such cessions outside India.
- Insurers shall place their reinsurance business outside India with only those reinsurers who have over a period of the past five years enjoyed a rating of at least BBB (with Standard and Poor) or equivalent rating of any other international rating agency. Placements with other reinsurers shall require the approval of the IRDA. Insurers may also place reinsurance with Lloyd's Syndicates after taking care to limit placements with individual syndicates commensurate with the capacity of the syndicate.
- Surplus over and above the domestic reinsurance arrangements classwise can be placed by the insurer independently subject to a limit of 10 per cent of total reinsurance premium ceded outside India being placed with any one reinsurer. Where it is necessary to cede a share exceeding such limit to any particular reinsurer, the insurer may seek the specific approval of the IRDA.

The Regulations also require the Indian Reinsurer to organize domestic pools for reinsurance surpluses in consultation with all insurers.

All the non-life insurance companies came together to form a Pool for Terrorism risks when the international reinsurance markets withdrew the cover after September 11, 2001 terrorists strikes in New York. On April 1, 2007, a Pool for motor insurance risks was formed which was eventually transformed into a pool for all commercial vehicles third party insurance. The share of GIC in the multilateral reinsurance arrangement is same as the share of statutory cessions. The balance of pooled business is shared by all other member insurers. GIC is the Administrator of the Pool and is being paid a fees of 2.5 per cent plus service tax on the total premium of the pooled business. These pools help to maintain the national retention levels of around 70 per cent of gross direct premium.

Reinsurance placed within India as a percentage of gross direct premium declined during the year 2012–13 and net retentions decreased during the year 2012–13.

# **General Insurance Corporation Of India**

The government nationalized the general insurance business in 1972. One hundred and seven insurers, including branches of foreign companies operating in India, were amalgamated and grouped into four companies, namely, The National Insurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company Limited, The Oriental Insurance Company Limited, and The United India Assurance Company Limited with head offices at Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, and Chennai. The General Insurance Corporation (GIC) was incorporated as a holding company of these four general insurance companies in November 1972. The Government of India subscribed to the capital of GIC which, in turn, subscribed to the capital of the four companies. All the four companies are government companies registered under the Companies Act. The GIC commenced business on January 1, 1973. GIC was formed for the purpose of superintending, controlling and carrying on the business of general insurance. The GIC was expected to generate competition among the four subsidiary companies. It was also entrusted to write directly the Aviation (Hull and Liability) insurance of the national carriers (Indian Airlines and Air India), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and the International Airport Authority of India.

The main objectives of GIC were superintending, controlling, and carrying on the business of general insurance.

The functions of GIC as mentioned in the Act were as follows:

- The carrying on of any part of general insurance business as deemed desirable.
- Aiding, assisting and advising the companies in the matter of setting up of standard of conduct and sound practice in general insurance business and in rendering efficient customer service.
- Advising the acquiring companies in the matter of controlling the expenses including the payment of commission and other expenses.
- Advising the acquiring companies in the matter of investment of funds.
- Issuing directions to acquiring companies in relation to the conduct of general insurance business.

In November 2000, the government notified the General Insurance Corporation of India as the 'Indian Reinsurer' under Section 101A of the Insurance Act, 1938. Insurance companies spread their risk by an arrangement with other underwriters or reinsurance companies known as reinsurers. The IRDA has prescribed that 20 per cent of the gross premium would have to be ceded compulsorily to GIC—as a reinsurer by all insurers. GIC has turned into a full reinsurer barring crop insurance which it manages for the time being on behalf of the government. GIC administers on behalf of the government, the Crop Insurance Scheme for areas and crops notified under it. GIC has to draw a reinsurance programme for the reinsurance industry every year and get it cleared by the IRDA. GIC also underwrites inward reinsurance business from Afro-Asian and Gulf nations.

It was designated as the Indian Reinsurer under Section 101A of the Insurance Act to which all the domestic insurers were obliged to cede 20 per cent of the gross direct premium in India which was reduced to 10 per cent in 2008–09. The objective was to retain maximum business in India and also to secure the best terms from foreign reinsurers through GIC for itself and all the four public sector companies.

The corporation's reinsurance programme has been designed to meet the objectives of optimizing the retention within the country ensuring adequate coverage for exposure and developing adequate capacities within the domestic market. The reinsurer has taken advantage of the prevailing competitive conditions to increase reinsurance support by participating/leading the reinsurance treaties of the

insurers and extending facultative support. It has also developed vertical capacity to cover risks upto  $\overline{51}$ ,500 crore PML (probable maximum loss) for the benefit of the Indian market. GIC has also made reinsurance arrangements to provide automatic cover to peak risks up to  $\overline{(}3,000)$  crore probable maximum loss (PML) under the peak risk facility. Further, since GIC does not have the aggregate exposures for each area/state, it has purchased an additional earthquake perils protection for  $\overline{500}$  crore.

GIC has diversified its operations to provide life reinsurance during 2003–04. A separate department has been set up for this purpose. Treaties have been entered into with both domestic and foreign insurers. Inward requests for reinsurance support have also been received from Asian and African countries.

The General Insurance Corporation of India is one of the largest financial institutions in the country. Figure 16.4 shows how the activities of GIC are organized.

The General Insurance Corporation has a high reach with a strong distribution network which consists of regional offices, divisional offices, branch offices, and agents. The regional head office undertakes underwriting, reinsurance and investment functions. The regional offices look into the administration and provide support to divisional offices. The divisional offices consist of divisional managers and development officers who also look into the training and development of agents. The divisional offices procure business, underwrite new business, and settle claims. Under divisional offices there are branch offices, which also procure new business. This multi-layered distribution system impedes quick decision-making and is a major contributor to the high expense ratio. The major incentive is on premium collection and not on account profitability.

# **Operations of GIC**

GIC manages marine hull pool and the terrorism pool on behalf of the Indian insurance industry. It also provides war cover, catastrophic peril cover, earthquake peril cover, marine cover and protection for personal accident business, and oil and energy business. It provides support to the Indian insurance industry in the form of obligatory cessions, company surplus treaties market surplus treaties, excess of loss protection to direct insurers in India. It has started leading the reinsurance programmes of several insurance companies in SAARC countries, South East Africa, Middle East, and Africa.

The income of GIC comprises of premium accepted under obligatory cessions, inward reinsurance arrangements by the non-life insurers and premium on reinsurance accepted from the international market.

GIC derives its risks from the claims liability of the direct insurers, inability to benefit from prompt payment of premiums upfront, running credit risks and currency fluctuation risks, and hazards of blind treaties.

GIC used to join term-lending institutions such as IDBI and IFCI in consortiums for lending mediumand long-term loans. It has opted out of loan consortium route for investments. Instead, it will lend directly to the infrastructure sector by investing in bonds and securitized instruments. GIC is concentrating its efforts on repackaging existing policies, launching new products, and development of existing policies.

GIC opened a full-fledged branch in Dubai and representative offices in London and Moscow as a step towards increasing foreign insurance business. About 23 per cent of the total inward business of GIC is from the Middle East, 33 per cent from Asia, 14 per cent each from Africa and West Europe, and 12 per cent from Mediterranean, East Europe, and CIS.

In order to concentrate exclusively on its core business—reinsurance, GIC 'moved' out of the mutual fund business.

GIC invests in units of UTI, equities of private and public sector undertakings, and approved government securities. GIC is an active player in the secondary market for shares and government securities.

GIC has now diversified into life reinsurance business to avail of the opportunities in the Indian life market.

GIC should focus on marketing to sell its reinsurance services in a competitive market.

GIC is manager of the third party motor pool.

# **Conclusion**

The reinsurance market in India is estimated at  $\overline{3,000}$  crore, with the GIC having a 40 per cent share. The domestic insurance companies reinsure the remaining 60 per cent in the global market through a reinsurance broker. The largest domestic reinsurance clients include ONGC, IOC, Indian Airlines, and Air India.

Foreign insurance companies are not interested in doing reinsurance business as they can do business in India by holding a maximum equity of 26 per cent either through a joint venture or by setting up their own subsidiary. Moreover, with a  $\overline{\tau}200$  crore paid-up capital, a domestic reinsurance company will not be able to underwrite reinsurance business of even a medium-sized project and would be required to retrocede the risk to an international company. The IRDA needs to infuse competition in reinsurance segment.

# **Life Insurance**

Life insurance is a contract between two parties, the assured and the assurer, whereby, the latter for consideration promises to pay a certain sum of money to the former (or failing him/her, to the person entitled to receive the same) on the happening of the event insured against. The life insurance contract provides for the payment of an amount on the date of maturity of the contract or at specified dates at periodic intervals or at untimely (prematured) death. The contract also provides that the insured shall pay premium periodically to the insurer.

There are five needs that life insurance can satisfy: dying young, living too long, disability, care for children, and wealth generation.

Life insurance is generally a long-term contract which provides a sense of security to the assured and his family. Life insurance is concerned with basically two hazards in the life of a person: that of dying prematurely leaving behind a dependent family and that of living to old age without financial support. Today, the nuclear family has replaced the joint family system, lifestyles have changed, needs and wants have increased and, above all, uncertain future adversities of life have increased. All these factors have led to an increasing demand for life insurance globally.

The life insurance business in India is still being dominated by the single monolith, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). Besides LIC, there are twenty-one new entrants in the life business .The total number of players in the life insurance business are 23 (one public sector and 22 private sector companies).

# **Benefits of Life Insurance**

#### Life insurance

- safeguards the insured's family against an untimely death and provides for a secured income;
- is a means of compulsory savings;
- is a source of income during old age;
- helps in meeting certain periodic financial needs, either for a child's education or marriage;
- improves the lifestyle of the insured and his family;
- takes care of disabilities and uncertain future adversities of life; and
- brings in tax-benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

# **Life Insurance Products**

There are four broad types of insurance policies to choose from—endowment, money-back, whole-life, and term insurance.

- **Endowment plan:** Under this plan, insurance cover is available for a specific period or term. The sum assured is payable even if the assured dies during this tenure period. In other words, the sum assured together with bonus is payable on the date of maturity or in the event of the death of the insured, whichever is earlier. The endowment policies are the most popular of all the life policies not only in India but world over they are perceived as savings instrument.
- **Money-back policies:** Money-back policies are also popular in India. Under this policy, the sum assured is returned as lumpsum after defined intervals of time. In other words, the assured receives a fixed sum at fixed intervals during the term of the policy. Both endowment and moneyback policies are by far the most expensive products.
- **Whole-life policy:** As the name suggests, it covers risk for whole life and is an insurance cover against death. It primarily caters to protection of a policyholder's entire life. The policyholder pays premium throughout his life and on his death, the money is handed over to his family. This policy is not so popular as it does not take into consideration the increasing needs of the insurer during his post-retirement years. Moreover, the cost of insurance is higher. For instance, the annual premium is  $\overline{3,000}$  per annum for a sum assured of  $\overline{51}$  lakh. To balance this high cost, insurance firms combine this policy with other types of policies.
- **Term insurance policy:** Term Insurance is a pure risk product. This policy is like a whole-life policy but offers risk cover for defined periods. This policy comes at a very low premium as the sum assured is payable only if the policyholder dies within the policy term. If he survives, he is not entitled to any payment on maturity, irrespective of premium payments made earlier. In case of term insurance, reserves are not accumulated and the premium is meant for offering protection alone. Therefore, the product offers high cover on payment of a small premium. Typically, the premium ranges between  $\overline{2}250$  to  $\overline{5}00$  annually for a term policy of  $\overline{5}1$  lakh.

Term insurance is the cheapest form of insurance. A term policy is taken either by young people as a life cover or as a security of their family against a long-term outstanding loan. This policy is not popular among investors as there are no maturity benefits available on survival until the end of the term. To increase its popularity, some private sector life insurers are offering a variant of the plain-vanilla term insurance policy called 'premium-back term insurance'. As the name suggests, at the end of the term, the insured gets back in full whatever premiums he has paid. However, this policy carries higher premiums than simple term insurance plan.

The life insurers now offer money-back options, pension plans, and unit-linked insurance, often with health insurance riders with premium collected through either lumpsum payments or in multiple instalments.

**Unit-linked Insurance Policies** These policies are becoming increasingly popular. Unit-linked policies are those where part of the premium is invested in a fund (similar to a mutual fund) and the return is linked to the performance of the fund. The investors are given a choice of three funds—a debt fund, a balanced fund, and an equity fund for investment. Unit-linked plans are more flexible and transparent compared to traditional insurance plans. Combining the protection and tax advantages of life insurance with the prospect of investing in securities, unit-linked plans dominate a large chunk of the insurance companies' portfolio. Unit-linked products are sold both under the individual single premium and nonsingle premium segments. Some common types of funds available in ULIPs are Bond Fund, Protector Fund, Secure Fund, Balanced Fund, Growth Fund, Index Fund, and Enhancer Fund. The choice of the fund depends on the risk appetite of the investor as the risk is to be borne by the investor. The investor also has to bear certain charges such as premium allocation charges, mortality charges, fund management charges, policy/administration charges, surrender charges, fund switching charges, and service tax.

Unit linked insurance policies are like mutual funds. When you pay the premium, the company after deducting stipulated charges, invests the amount in stock market instruments like equity and debenture. Here also the investors are given the choice whether they prefer to go for high risk (more investment in equity), medium risk and low risk. Thus, the major benefits to investors in ULIP is to have the benefit of appreciation of the investment, benefits of tax rebate as provided under section 80CC of the IT Act and above all, a life cover. Insurance companies are required to declare the NAV of various ULIPs on a daily basis.

There has been a surge in the demand for ULIPs on account of varied benefits such as flexibility to choose sum assured and premium amount, option to change level of premium and asset allocation by switching between funds, transparency in the net amount invested, tracking of investment performance on a daily basis and option to withdraw money after five years.

• Unit-linked insurance policies are those where a part of the premium is charged for the risk cover and the rest is invested in select mutual funds as per the choice of the investor.

• ULIPs contribute more than 50 per cent of the new business premium of life insurance companies.

Despite the growing popularity of ULIPs, policy holders rely heavily on the advice rendered by the distributors and agents. The complicated design of the policies makes them less aware of the product features and chances of mis-selling by agents are high. Agents withhold certain information that causes the most damage. They do not tell the buyer that if he exercises the option to stop paying premium after a few years, the rate of return will fall on account of high front loading charges in the initial three to four years of the policy and the investor will get his money after deduction of all charges only after five years. Investor needs to stay longterm to reap the benefits. To protect the interest of the customers, IRDA has taken the following initiatives:

- **Lock in period increased to five years:** IRDA has increased the lock-in period for all unit-linked products from three years to five years, including top-up premiums, thereby making them long-term financial instruments, which basically provide risk protection.
- **Level paying premiums:** Further, all regular premium/limited premium ULIPs shall have uniform/ level paying premiums. Any additional payments shall be treated as single premium for the purpose of insurance cover.
- **Even distribution of charges:** Charges on ULIPs are mandated to be evenly distributed during the lock in period to ensure that high front ending of expenses is eliminated.
- **Minimum premium paying term of five years:** All limited premium unit-linked insurance products, other than single premium products shall have premium paying term of at least five years.
- **Increase in risk component:** Further, all unit-linked products, other than pension and annuity products shall provide a mortality cover or a health cover thereby increasing the risk cover component in such products.
- **Minimum guaranteed return for pension products:** As regards pension products, all ULIP pension/annuity products shall offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent per annum or as specified by IRDA from time to time. This will protect the life time savings for the pensioners from any adverse fluctuations at the time of maturity.
- **Rationalization of cap on charges:** With a view to smoothening the cap on charges, the capping has been rationalized to ensure that the difference in yield is capped from the 5th year onwards. This will not only reduce the overall charges on these products, but also smoothen the charge structure for the policyholder.
- **Discontinuance of charges:** IRDA has also addressed the issue of discontinuance of charges for surrender of ULIPs. The IRDA (Treatment of Discontinued-Linked Insurance Policies) regulations brought out by IRDA in this regard ensure that policyholders do not get overcharged when they wish to discontinue their policies for any emergency cash requirement. The regulations stipulate that an insurer shall recover only the incurred acquisition costs in the event of discontinuance of policy and that these charges are not excessive. The discontinuance charges have been capped both as percentage of fund value and premium and also in absolute value. The regulations also clearly define the grace period for different modes of premium payment. Upon discontinuance of a policy, a policyholder shall be entitled to exercise an option of either reviving the policy or completely withdrawing from the policy without any risk cover. Further, the regulations also enable IRDA to order refund of discontinuance charges in case they are found excessive on enquiry.

**Group Insurance Policies** Individual life insurance business is divided into three main business segments—individual regular business, single premium business, and individual pension business. The group insurance segment mainly comprises of regular group insurance, corporate gratuity and superannuation plans. Regular group insurance policies cover groups of people such as employees in a firm. Corporates purchase these policies to cover their employees. These policies are popular as the premium per employee turns out to be low. The group gratuity and superannuation plans are a result of statutory obligation.

## **New Players in the Life Insurance Market**

Life insurance business is now a sophisticated business in India.

The deregulation of the insurance sector increased the number of players in the life insurance market. There are 22 new private sector players in the life insurance market. They are:

Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Limited

Birla Sun-Life Insurance Company Limited

HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Limited

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited

ING Vysya Life Insurance Company Limited Max New York Life Insurance Company Limited Metlife India Insurance Company Pvt.Limited Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited SBI Life Insurance Company Limited TATA AIG Life Insurance Company Limited Reliance Life Insurance Company Limited Aviva Life Insurance Company Limited Sahara India Life Insurance Company Limited Shriram Life Insurance Company Limited Bharti AXA Life Insurance Company Limited Future Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited IDBI Fortis Life Insurance Company Limited Canara HSBC Oriental Bank Of Commerce Life Insurance Company Limited Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company Limited DLF Pramerica Life Insurance Company Limited Star Union Dai-ichi Life. India First Life Insurance Company Limited

The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which had a monopolistic control over the market, faced a stiff competition from the new entrants. Competition led to the adoption of distinct marketing strategies and alternative distribution channels.

Among the private sector players, ICICI Prudential is the market leader. ICICI's success is driven by aggressive distribution, leveraging existing customer base, and detailed implementation planning. All new entrants have expanded rapidly and have presence in about all cities across the country, represented by more than 13 lakh agents. They have introduced a large number of new products and collectively spent about  $\bar{\tau}$ 200 crore on advertising.

To compete and survive in this highly competitive environment, insurers are offering insurance solutions which are customized to match with individual needs. In order to provide better services to the customers, the insurers have set up national level call centres, interactive voice response systems and websites that provide interactive tools to help customers to plan their needs. To increase their reach, insurers have tapped alternative distribution channels such as tie-ups with banks and retail giants like Shoppers' Stop. Insurers are also using their existing customer database and database of the distributors to cross-sell the products. These strategies have increased customer awareness of insurance which has led to a growth in the life insurance business.

There is a large market for insurance untapped in rural areas. With 74 per cent of India's population living in rural areas and contributing 40 per cent to national income, insurance companies are looking at rural markets as an opportunity rather than obligation. The private sector life insurance companies are designing innovative insurance products and marketing strategies for the rural market. Many of the companies have tied up with non-government organization and social activists agencies for promoting and distributing their products.

The private sector life insurance companies have been a in a position to capture around 30 per cent of the market share in a short span of twelve years. This reflects that they have succeeded in building faith among the Indian investors. Moreover, their success is also due to smart pricing and tailor-made design of the products.

Private life insurance companies have brought in robust risk management and fund management practices.

With the entry of new players, the monolith LIC was forced to adopt better marketing strategies. In fact, LIC's business grew tremendously after deregulation of the insurance sector. It could further strengthen its brand equity inspite of the entry of some reputed private sector players. LIC has adopted a market savvy approach and introduced new products and policies. LIC has to aggressively explore new untapped markets to meet the challenge of private sector players.

The IRDA has made it compulsory for life insurers to provide premium rates with a facility of a premium calculator on their websites. This move is towards improving transparency and allowing customers to compare rates across companies.

## **Changing Trends in Life Insurance**

Insurance contracts in India are typically sold rather than bought. Before deregulation, life insurance policies were sold as tax-saving products by LIC. Insurance purchase decision was driven by a shortterm motive to invest a small sum as premium to reduce tax liability. The two most popular products of LIC were Endowment and Money-Back Policies—the saving products. They dominated the Indian insurance market, accounting for nearly 99.5 per cent of the policies sold and nearly 99.9 per cent of the premium income before deregulation. The mindset of the Indian consumer is changing. The Indian consumer no longer views insurance as a tax-benefit induced exercise. This change has been due to the following reasons:

- The efforts of the private sector players who could successfully create an awareness that the primary focus for any insurance cover is protection, savings is only a spin-off benefit. The entry of private sector companies has brought about a paradigm shift in the definition of the word insurance.
- A substantial drop in insurance prices, which created a preference for insurance products. Moreover, consumers have realised that there are several options for deploying savings but there is no substitute for life insurance as a means of protection.

This changing trend has led to an increase in demand for insurance products which offer protection. The insurance companies are aggressively marketing whole life and term plans.

Another trend is an increase in the awareness about purchasing the correct amount of risk cover commensurate with one's age, income, and profile. This has led to an increase in the size of the policy. Before deregulation, the policy sizes were restricted to the premium levels under which one would receive tax benefits. Life insurance companies are offering tailor-made products to suit the differing needs of the consumers. Life insurance products are designed to adjust protection levels within the same policy. Moreover, these companies are providing the clients with innovative, flexible, and attractive riders. Joint ventures with renowned foreign insurance companies have provided an added advantage in product innovation.

After opening up of the insurance sector, Unit-linked insurance policies (ULIPs) have become increasingly popular but there has been a decline in ULIPs since 2010–11 due to sluggish market condition and high misselling of the product.

## **Investments**

Life insurance is a long-term contract, which generates investible surplus. Life insurance premiums are received in advance by the life insurance companies. These premiums should be judiciously invested until they are needed to pay claims and expenses. The income received from investment is paid in the form of dividends to policyholders, which reduces the cost of life insurance. Moreover, these premiums, if invested in infrastructure and social sectors, lead to higher economic growth of the country. In view of the above, the IRDA has mandated the pattern of investments to be followed by the life insurance companies. It has also specified that every insurer carrying on the business of life insurance shall invest and at all times keep invested his controlled fund (other than funds relating to pension and general annuity business and unit-linked life insurance business) in the following manner:

| Type of Investment                                                              | Percentage        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Government securities                                                        | 25%               |
| 2. Government securities or other approved securities (including (i) above)     | Not less than 50% |
| 3. Approved investments as specified in schedule I                              |                   |
| a. Infrastructure and social sector                                             | Not less than 15% |
| b. Others to be governed by exposure norms (investments in 'Other than Approved |                   |
| Investments' in no case can exceed 15% of the fund)                             | Not exceeding 35% |

Prior to the notification of the Investment Regulations, 2000, by the IRDA, the investments of LIC were as per the directions of the government. Both the new players and LIC are trying to comply with the new investment regulations.

**Approved Investments for Life Business** 'Approved Investments' for the purposes of Section 27 A of the act shall be as follows:

- All approved investments specified in Section 27 A of the act except
- Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 27 A of the act;
- first mortgages on immovable property situated in other country as stated in Clause (m) of Sub-section (1) of Section 27 A of the act;
- immovable property situated in other country as stated in Clause (n) of Sub-section (1) of Section 27 A of the act.

In addition, the IRDA has declared the following investments as approved under vide clause (s) of (1) of Sub-section (1) of Section 27A:

- All secured loans, deposits, debentures, bonds, other debt instruments, shares and preference shares rated as 'very strong' or more by a reputed and independent rating agency (*e.g.*, AA of Standard and Poor).
- Deposits with banks (e.g., in current account, call deposits, notice deposits, term deposits, certificates of deposits) and with primary dealers recognized by the RBI included for the time being in the second schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934).
- Commercial papers issued by a company having a 'very strong' or more rating by a reputed and independent rating agency (e.g., AA of Standard and Poor).
- Investments in venture capital funds of such companies/organizations which have a proven track record and have been rated 'very strong' or more by a reputed and independent rating agency (*e.g.*, AA of Standard and Poor).

The life insurers have to invest their life, pension and general annuity, group and unit-linked funds as per Regulation 3 of the IRDA (Investment) Regulations, 2000. These funds are to be invested in central government securities, state government securities, other approved securities and infrastructure/social sector. The total investible funds of life insurance industry stood at  $\overline{317,44,893}$  crore at end- March 2013 representing a growth of 15 per cent over the previous year. About 61 per cent of these funds were invested in government securities much higher than the stipulated rate of 50 per cent. Of all the players, the LIC was the biggest contributor with total investible funds of  $\overline{514,02,999}$  crore which was 85 per cent of the total invested funds.

An analysis reveals that around 97 per cent of the premiums from traditional products such as endowment plans is invested in approved securities (government securities, corporate bonds and the money market). The share of ULIP fund has came down to 19.63 per cent while 80 per cent of funds available for investments has been from traditional products.

## **Maintenance of Solvency Margins of Insurers**

Life insurers are custodians and managers of investments of individuals. Every life insurer is required to maintain an excess of value of its assets over the amount of its liabilities of not less than  $\overline{50}$  crore ( $\overline{100}$ ) crore in the case of a reinsurer) or a sum equivalent based on a prescribed formula; as determined by regulations not exceeding 5 per cent of the mathematical reserves and a percentage not exceeding one per cent of the sum at risk for the policies on which the sum at risk is not negative, whichever isthe highest.

#### **Box 16.2** 'Human Life Value'—A Tool to Know Your Worth

The first thought that comes in mind to provide financial security for our family is life Insurance. Life insurance is the most efficient way of furnishing security & it offers people methods of achieving economic security. But, how much your family needs in your absence would is a question, which you find difficult to answer. While there are several ways to arrive at the right amount of cover you need to provide the financial security to your family, the most efficient way is through calculating 'Human Life Value'.

Human Life Value (HLV) is a methodology to determine the appropriate amount of sum assured you need to have at present in case of future loss of income. In simple words, it is that amount, which can ensure that the standard of living of the family is not affected even if the earning member is not there. HLV calculation is a tool that is used very effectively for financial planning around the world. It is a systematic way of understanding the gaps in the financial planning.

How do you determine your Human Life Value? Human Life Value is determined by three main factors:

- 1. Your age
- 2. Current and future expenses.
- 3. Current and future income
- How to Calculate:

**Approach 1**: This approach focuses on income of the individual and family while arriving at the HLV. This approach is based on the simple reasoning that the value of one's life is equal to his earning capacity. In the event of death of the breadwinner in a family, it is the current as well as prospective income of the family member which is the real financial loss to the family. Hence the sum insured should take care of loss of income rather than anything else.

Let see an example, where HLV is calculated for Mr Vivek Rao based on the present needs and income. Mr Vivek Rao aged 41 years has an annual income of ₹10 lakhs, spends ₹3 lakhs on his personal expenses (including Taxes). He has Fixed Deposits of ₹6 lakhs. He also has a loan of ₹10 lakhs and plans to spend ₹10 lakhs each on his son's education and his daughter's marriage. His human life value will be as follows:

| Annual Gross Income                                                           | 10,00,000   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Less Expense on Self including taxes                                          | 300,000     |
| Contribution to Family Standard of Living                                     | 700,000     |
| Multiplying factor                                                            | 15          |
| Gross Human Life Value                                                        | 1,05,00,000 |
| Less Liquid Assets                                                            | 600,000     |
| Add Liabilities                                                               | 1,000,000   |
| Add Amount to fulfill family needs like daughter's marriage & son's education | 2,000,000   |
| Human Life Value                                                              | 1,29,00,000 |

Expenditure on self-maintenance is 1/3 of gross income for people. This also includes varying tax liabilities. Liquid assets would be available to the family in the event of the death of the breadwinner. It does not include the value of other assets like property or jewellery since it is assumed that the family would continue using these assets.

A fixed multiplier is applied on the annual income. Multipliers based on the age of the individual are given in the table below:

| Aqe            | <b>Multiplying Factor</b> |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Upto 35 years  | 25 times                  |
| 36 to 40 Years | 20 times                  |
| 41 to 45 years | 15 times                  |
| 46 to 50 years | 12 Times                  |
| 51 to 60 years | 10 Times                  |
| 61 to 65 years | 5 Times                   |

The multiplying factors given above are just thumb rules. Ideally they are supposed to reflect the "working life' of the individual at the time of taking insurance. In order to customise HLV the age at which one would like to retire has to be fixed. The multiplier may be worked out accordingly.

**Approach 2**: The basic flaw with the income approach is that because it focuses on income the sum insured works out to be too high. Taking insurance for such a high HLV may become expensive and unaffordable at times.

An alternative and perhaps a more logical approach is the expenditure approach. Insurance is ideally supposed to put the insured family in the same position as they were before the unfortunate event of death. This can be done more properly if the underlying variable is expenditure and not income.

Moreover, expenditure is something which needs to be incurred over a period of time and not at a time and hence the proceeds of life insurance should ideally provide enough capital to the family that yields a risk free return that is sufficient to defray expenses at a given standard of living. The objective here is to ensure that family sustains at the same standard of living.

The following steps may be exercised:

- 1. Calculate the annual expenditure on the family which is required to maintain their current standard of living.
- 2. Add expenses like expenses on children's education and marriage to this amount.
- 3. If the period for which insurance is planned is more than 10 years, the expenditure amount has to be suitably adjusted for inflation. The annual expense figure which is based on current prices need to be loaded to the extent of inflation. Instead of loading it for 15 or 20 years it may be loaded for 10 years only. This is because loading it for 20 years would result in a very high figure and secondly the peak of an individual's financial responsibility curve would be attained in next 10 years. After this the curve would anyway start declining.
- 4. Estimate the risk free rate of return into which the life insurance proceeds would be invested by the family.

| Example:                      |
|-------------------------------|
| والملاحظ والمستحيط المتنبوذية |

| Annual household expenditure including loan instalments                     | 240,000   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Expenses on higher education for children                                   | 10,00,000 |
| Risk free rate of return                                                    | 8%        |
| Amount that will yield a return equivalent to annual household expenditure. | 30,00,000 |
| Add education expenses                                                      | 10,00,000 |
| <b>HLV</b>                                                                  | 40,00,000 |

The Human Life Value is just indicative and a starting point in reference to a person's current ability to set aside money for him and his family's future financial security. There are ready calculators available for calculating the HLV based on current and future income and expenses as well. Once a prospect is convinced with the amount, he can choose various life insurance plans for covering yourself.

In addition, at the time of registration all the new insurers have been required to maintain a solvency ratio of 1.5 times the normal requirements. All life insurers comply with the stipulated solvency ratio of 1.5.

# **Life Insurance Council**

The Life Insurance Council was set up in 2004, under the aegis of the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IRDA), to put forward common issues of life insurance to the IRDA and the government. It was formed as per Section 64 C of the Insurance Act, all registered life insurance companies are the members of this council. There are two nominees from the IRDA, one of whom is the Chairman of the Council. The Secretary General functions as the chief executive of the Council.

The council has taken up issues such as income tax, service tax, monitoring of management expenses, strict rules of market conduct, insurance education research and setting up of a new entity—Mortality and Morbidity Investigation Bureau (MMIB) for effective data management.

The life insurance industry made a first move towards self regulation from August 23, 2003. The industry set up a 'Life Insurance Self Regulation Standards of Conduct and Sound Practice. Life insurers can no longer sell policies by generating irrational expectations. All insurance companies will have to use a standardized rate of return set out by the Life Insurance Council in consultation with the Actuarial Society of India. Clients must be informed that rates of return are not guaranteed. Illustrations should project both optimistic and conservative views. All policy changes need to be stated explicitly. Insurers cannot force customers to buy add-on benefits. An insurance company has to inform client of policy status atleast once a year.

# **Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) Of India**

On January 19, 1956, 154 Indian insurers, 16 non-Indian (foreign) insurers, and 75 provident societies operating in India, were taken over by the central government and then nationalized on September 1, 1956. The Life Insurance Corporation of India came into existence on September 1, 1956, as an autonomous body with five zonal offices, 33 divisional offices, and 212 branches and sub-offices all over India at 97 centres.

The Life Insurance Corporation of India was set up with the objective of spreading life insurance much more widely and, in particular, to the rural areas and to the socially and economically backward classes with a view to reaching all insurable persons in the country and providing them adequate financial cover against death at a reasonable cost. The role of LIC was to maximize mobilization of people's savings by way of premia and ensuring the welfare of the country including the policy holders by investing and directing the funds in activities which contribute to the economic prosperity of the country.

In the era of liberalization, privatization, and globalization, it has redefined its vision, mission and objectives broadly.

The Life Insurance Corporation of India is still a monolith. It enjoys a tremendous brand equity and a high reach with a strong distribution network which consists of eight zonal offices, 106 divisional offices, 323 satellite offices 2,048 branch offices, and 11.93 lakh agents (See Figure 16.5). The zonal offices look into the development, planning and review of business valuations, recruitment, training of staff, and supervision of divisional offices. The divisional office procures new business, plans and executes various new business operations, underwrites new business as well as securities, and settles claims. Under each divisional office, there are a number of branch offices which procure new business.

### **Achievements of LIC**

The Life Insurance Corporation had a monopoly over the life insurance market till 2000. But its market share started declining with the entry of private sector players. Its market share declined to 71 per cent in 2004. It regained its market share through aggressive marketing of its insurance products and expanding the distribution channel. For efficient customer servicing, it has connected all the branches through a Metro Area Network. LIC has tied up with some banks and service providers to offer on-line premium collection facility in selected cities.

LIC has set up Wide Area Network (WAN), which enables policy holders to view their policy details and make payment of premium from any branch office. It has also provided Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to provide basic information about policies to policy holders on telephone and fax. It has installed on line kiosks in prominent places of big cities to provide information regarding LIC's products and the organization. These on-line kiosks also provide facility of depositing the cheques. The website of the corporation has been made more interactive and informative. LIC launched Corporate Active Data Warehouse (CADW) in 2006 which will house the entire IT infrastructure relating to all core applications of LIC. LIC has emerged as the second largest user of computers and information technology in India.

LIC's corporate magazine 'Yogakshema' won the first prize in the 'Internal Magazines' category in the year 2000 by the Association of Business Communicators of India (ABCI). LIC won Awaaz Consumer Award 2006 in the insurance category as the most preferred brand of insurance companies. It was also awarded the NDTV Profit Business Leader in Insurance.

LIC is one of the largest life insurance companies in the world with in-force policy base of over 200 million. It issued over one crore policies during 2005. LIC is the top ranking company in the world in number of claims settled. It settles 1.43 claims every second. Its percentage of outstanding claims is the lowest. LIC is a market leader with a commanding share of over 73 per cent contribution to the total life insurance premium.

### **The Life Insurance Industry**

There are 24 players in the life insurance industry—one public sector (LIC) and the remaining twenty three are private sector players. The LIC is the largest insurer followed by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life. New business premium for the industry as a whole was around  $\bar{\tau}1,07,362$  crore during 2012–13 as compared to  $\bar{\tau}1,13,942$  crore during 2011–12. Life Insurance Corporation's market share increased to 73 per cent while the markets have of private players declined marginally from 29.32 per cent in 2011–12 to 27.30 per cnet in 2012–13.

The size of the life insurance market has grown over the thirteen years of opening up of the sector. The growth of the life insurance industry in India was the fastest in the world in 2006. The industry growth rate was a remarkable high of 163 per cent during 2006. The individual single premium segment was the dominant accounting for 60 per cent of the new business growth. The unit-linked insurance plans were a hot favourite among investors. Investors chose growth plans which invest in equity followed by balanced funds which invest in mix of equity and debt. The size of the life insurance market increased on the strength of the growth of the economy, increase in per capita income and buoyant stock markets.

LIC's performance was record breaking (184 per cent) in 2006 which pushed the industry's growth rate to 163 per cent. The life insurance business (measured in the context of first year premium) registered a decline of 5.78 per cent in 2012–13, (94.96 per cent achieved in 2006–07). Insurance penetration or premium volume as a ratio of GDP, for the year 2012 stood at 3.17 per cent for life insurance and 0.78 per cent for non-life insurance. Private insurers have improved their market share from 18.10 per cent in 2006–07 to 30 per cent in 2012–13 in the total premium collected during the year.

There has been a shift in favour of pension products and an increase in the renewal premium. This reflects quality of business underwritten by the insurers and an increase in persistency ratio which, in turn, enables insurers to bring down the overall cost of doing business.

Majority of the private sector players have not been able to report profits as this industry is capital intensive in nature. Insurers are required to inject capital at frequent intervals to achieve growth in premium incomes. Moreover, high commission charges, training costs, maintaining the solvency margin and other costs eat up the revenues generated. During 2012–13, sixteen of the private sector companies reported net profits. The SBI Life insurance company was the first private company to report net profit of `2.02 crore in 2005–06. It reported higher net profit of `3.83 crore in 2006–07 and further increased its net profit level to  $\overline{34.38}$  crore in 2007–08. The company succeeded in achieving an early break even on account of its lower cost of operations due to the large network of its Indian partner, the State Bank of India. SBI Life has reported profits for 7 out of last 8 years. Bajaj Allianz has reported profits for four years in a row.

The growth in life insurance industry in India gained momentum with the entry of new players. Rather than taking away the market share of the existing public sector player, the private sector players have helped expand this market by aggressive marketing and new product offerings. But the industry focus has been largely on 'selling' insurance rather than creating a risk management culture amongst individuals. This is also why the share of insurance in overall GDP is a frugal 4.0 per cent for life insurance and 0.6 for non-life insurance. The outreach of insurance is equally modest at 20 per cent of the insurable population in case of life and just around one per cent for health insurance.

While the basic premise governing life insurance is risk coverage, an additional feature of savings has traditionally accompanied insurance. In order to stimulate long-term savings with insurance, tax concessions were made an integral part of life insurance. Due to this, the limited returns on life insurance policies appeared lucrative in comparison to other investments like bank deposits, because of the tax breaks. However, post liberalization with more and more productive investment channels opening up for the retail investor, many of them with equivalent tax benefits, endowment products have lost their shine off-late.

The changing investment profile in the country gave birth to the concept of Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs). These new generation insurance products combine the modern high risk high return investment objectives with insurance. Accordingly, a part of the premium (known as mortality premium) is charged for the risk cover and the rest is invested in select mutual funds as per the choice of the investor. While ULIPs offer transparency, flexibility, and liquidity—something that was missing in endowment products—certain issues like inadequate disclosure of charges, posing them as short-term investment options, encouraging non-payment of premiums after few initial instalments have tended to undermine the vitality of these innovative products. Moreover, the mutual fund industry response to the needs of retail investors through simple, transparent and cost effective mechanisms like Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) have given a stiff alternative to ULIPs. The aggressive selling of ULIPs by insurers often without regard to the basic tenets of insurance and investing, prompted the insurance regulator (IRDA) to issue stringent guidelines on ULIPs in December 2005. Since then, things appear to have fairly stabilized.

Whether ULIPs or endowment policies, life insurance has been sold more as an investment tool rather than a crucial risk transfer mechanism. This blend of risk (protection) and return (investment) has not quite worked in favour of the layman insured investor. What is expected from the insurance industry in the years to come is a more cohesive effort in expanding the outreach of insurance per-se and not the spurious message of protecting life as well as offering high return on investment.

The life insurance sector has been facing some turmoil since last few years. The premium growth at the industry level has been chequered. On the other hand life insurance penetration in India remains at a dismal 3.17 and has in fact slipped over the past few years. Thus while a large untapped potential remains to be covered by the life insurance industry, the growth has already slowed down.

The problems with the life insurance sector are manifold. Aggressive selling of investment oriented products that could not generate adequate returns has resulted in large scale lapsation of life insurance policies resulting in declining persistency ratios of insurers. This coupled with a slowdown of the overall economy and declining new business has slowed down the overall business growth. Profitability of life insurers also remains erratic. Regulatory interventions and reducing access to fresh capital has finally brought back bottom line focus in the industry but it will take a while before the adjusted business models begin to show concrete impact on growth and profitability of the life insurance sector.

# **Micro Insurance**

• Micro insurance is provision of insurance to poor.

The use of insurance as a cover on risks is very poor in India. Even after the entry of private companies in the insurance market, though one sees some improvement in the share of insurance in the overall GDP, the number of policies taken on life and health is low looking to the insurable population of India. In fact, the focus of marketing insurance products has always been prosperous individuals in case of life and industry for the non-life sector. Very little effort is made to reach the large low income population, particularly in the rural areas.

The poor have greater risks of life, income and the standard of living than that of the rich. Due to absence of savings, these risks can push families to poverty and indebtedness. A death of a breadwinner or an illness in a poor family is a much severe blow to the family as compared to a rich family. Insurance provides financial support to individuals and families in such times which happen rarely but are very hard blows to low-income families. So looking at it from a social security point of view, the families that need insurance the most are often least served.

Micro insurance tries to find answers to the above questions. It aims at building mechanisms for insuring the poor against various risks.

Micro insurance is the insurance provided through the Micro insurance products which includes "general micro-insurance product". General micro insurance products cover health insurance contract, any contract covering the belongings, such as hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident contract, either on individual or group basis with a maximum amount of cover as rupees one lakh and minimum and maximum term cover of one year.

**Micro Insurance Products** A micro insurance product is an insurance policy with a small sum insured and low premium. It is designed to reduce the fundamental risks of life, living and livelihood.

| <b>Risk</b> | Product (Kind of Policy)                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Life        | Term Life Insurance, Accidental Death Insurance |
| Living      | Heath Insurance, Catastrophe (Sudden Calamity)  |
|             | Insurance                                       |
| Livelihoods | Asset Insurance, Weather Insurance              |

The essential feature of an ideal micro insurance product that makes it successful is the right balance between insurability (capacity to take a policy) and saleability (possibility on the insurer's side to offer it). Consideration of risk involves frequency and severity. Frequency means the probability of risk arising at individual level. Higher the frequency of risk, higher will be the response to the product. That is because people always like protection against the risks that strike frequently. But its insurability will be reduced by higher frequency as claims-processing costs will increase. And that would increase premium. A high premium will act as a disincentive for people, who will in turn prefer not to buy insurance. This will result in insured people having to pay a higher premium. And if the frequency is too low, but the risk is high and insurable, people will hardly find insurance against such risk worth buying. In nutshell, the frequency has to be high enough to be credible but low enough to keep claims processing costs within reasonable limits.

Severity is the likely size of the loss. It is derived from expected losses of the group likely to buy a policy. In simple terms, it is the average (mean) of losses suffered by members of a common group divided by the expected number of members of the group. In addition to expected losses, the variability (standard deviation) around the mean also plays a role in arriving at the severity factor. In fact, variability in a loss distribution is the real 'risk'. It is because one has to assume that expected losses would occur in the long run. Expected losses and their deviation would provide the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) of loss distribution that is the severity factor. High-severity risks (like flood, earthquake, etc) are bound to incite interest among the people and thus result in high saleability. Very high probable maximum loss is likely to affect insurability. Thus while the severity of risk has to be sufficiently threatening for the people, it has to be low enough to keep PML within limits to be insurable.

In order to see an impact on the risk profile of an insured population, it is necessary to see that the micro insurance product is durable. Insurance, as a risk distribution tool, is useful only if pursued for a long term. Too much activity, with insured persons moving in and out, will not only prevent impact on the risk profile of the community but also make the product volatile. Thus a sustainable micro insurance programme presupposes the existence of an optimally priced product with frequency and severity factors carefully balanced. If the risks covered do not naturally fall within the limits discussed above, they have to be manually adjusted through underwriting and marketing interventions.

# **Micro Insurance Distribution**

The role of intermediary in micro insurance is much wider. The focus here is the community, not an individual. So it is essential to have very good ability to manage community risk and educate the masses on the concept and benefits of insurance. The various functions performed by an intermediary (deliverer) are:

**(i) Risk Identification and Assessment** Identification and assessment of risk is the key starting point to a sustainable micro insurance programme. The risks faced by the poor are diverse and vary according to the geographical and demographic profiles. Apart from this, affordability is the biggest deterrent. Hence, proper risk assessment is a pre-requisite to the development of a balanced and sustainable insurance product. For this, the experience of an intermediary is vital. The intermediary in order to perform this function should have good understanding of social and economic factors surrounding the masses.

**(ii) Education and Awareness** Insurance is always sold never bought. The concept of insurance as a risk-transfer tool has yet to be understood by the affluent segment. The task of the intermediary becomes more difficult with micro insurance. This calls for a concerted effort in educating the masses on the concept as well as the benefits. Popularising the concept of insurance is necessary to ensure success in the form of large enrolment among the people.

**(iii) Enrolment** This is one of the conventional roles of an intermediary. Proper enrolment of the insured into the programme involves accurate documentation of relevant details about the insured and delivery of policy documents. This stage marks the beginning of the relationship with the insured and thus warrants due care.

**(iv) Controlling Adverse Section and Moral Hazard** Underwriting forms the crux of insurance business. Underwriting is the process of selecting, classifying and rating (pricing) risk in consonance with the insurance coverage offered. Intermediaries are field underwriters and thus in a better position to take notice of instances of adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection refers to a situation where people with higher expected losses enter the insured population. It is either not possible or too costly for the insurers to identify such clients a priori. For example, a person having blood pressure or diabetes taking a health insurance policy. Moral hazard is phenomenon whereby having insured a property, the insured lacks the incentive to reduce his expected losses despite having some control over them. For example an insured not caring to lock his vehicle because the insurer is going to pay for the loss in the event of a theft. The deliverer's role is to try to control both these features at the field level itself. They are gatekeepers for insurers. It is they who decide whether to accept the insurance proposal, on what terms and conditions and at what price.

• Adverse selection occurs when individuals who are prone to a particular risk, purchase insurance against it. It is more common in health insurance.

**(v) Marketing** The intermediary needs distinct skills to market micro insurance products. He needs to build up confidence in the poor by making them aware of the ground-level realities. For doing this, he has to develop a credible image of himself and the system.

**(vi) Claim Servicing** This again is a conventional role of the intermediary. It includes collecting claim documents in time, explaining the basis of claims settlement and payment of claims. The intermediary can reduce the time and effort in claim servicing if he clarifies the claim settlement process during earlier stages.

It is clear from the role defined above that service delivery function in micro insurance calls for an intermediary with multi-faceted traits. He should have a strong link with masses especially rural and poor population, sound administrative capability, strong understanding of the principles and practice of risk management and insurance, and a long-term commitment.

Micro insurance aims at improving the risk profile of the community. Hence it is essential for the intermediary to focus on various risks faced by the masses and offer solutions in terms of insurance products. These functions put together involve a sizeable transaction cost in the entire delivery process. And cost recovery is often a major irritant in micro insurance delivery. In most cases, this is possible only after a gestation period of about three to five years. This calls for very careful financial planning by the intermediary before initiating a micro insurance programme.

**Micro Insurance Delivery Models** The micro insurance movement begun by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) and Community-based Organizations (CBOs) may not have taken off in a big way but has definitely made a serious attempt in increasing the spread of insurance in the country.

In India, following distribution models have emerged in the evolution of micro insurance (Figure 16.6):

**(i) Partner–Agent Model** Among the distribution models in micro-insurance, this is the common insurance delivery model where the intermediary merely acts as a product-deliverer. Here, the insurance company bears the risk and the NGO acts as an agent . This model is useful for delivering simple insurance products like term life insurance. Examples of the partner-agent model in India include Shepherd and United India Insurance Company, and Karuna Trust and National Insurance Company.

**(ii) Community-based/Mutual Model** This is a self-insurance scheme where the community itself pools the contributions and acts as an insurer. Members/clients are both the insured and the insurers as the group is involved both in management and underwriting the risk collectively. This is particularly helpful in managing low severity risks like primary healthcare. People's Rural Health Promotion Scheme (PRHPS) introduced by People's Rural Education Movement (PREM) in Orissa, Arthik Samata Mandal-Vijaywada,, Yashaswini Health Farmer Scheme introduced by the Karnataka Government are successful community-based models.

**(iii) Full-service Model** This model has a much wider role for the intermediary. The insurer simply carries the risk and all the remaining functions including claims-processing are taken up by the deliverer. This model is useful for complicated and service intensive covers like health and weather insurance. Vimo SEWA is an integrated insurance program aiming to provide social protection for SEWA members to cover their life cycle needs and the various risks they face in their lives, through an insurance organization in which they themselves are users, owners and managers of all services. It offers three different integrated insurance packages, which include coverage for death, sickness, and loss of assets. The three packages have varying levels of premium and corresponding sums insured.

**(iv) Provider-driven Model** This is the new addition in the micro insurance space. It aims at integrating services like healthcare with insurance. The healthcare provider assumes the risk thereby eliminating a tier in the value chain. Service providers like hospitals who are anyway involved in the service-delivery chain, integrate themselves fully by assuming the risk themselves.

These models have a good potential in health insurance.

# **Micro Insurance Regulation**

An insurer transacting life insurance business shall be permitted to provide life micro insurance products as well as general micro insurance products provided it ties up with an insurer transacting general insurance business for the general micro insurance products, and vice versa. The tie-up can be either at product level or distribution level.

• Moral hazard occurs when the insured lacks the incentive to reduce his expected losses having some control over them and takes advantage of insurance to make claims for loss that he has helped incur.

• A new distribution mechanism is required for selling micro insurance.

• In addition to the common partneragent model, Tata-AIG developed a model of microagents.

The IRDA has set out the objectives and salient features of the Micro Insurance-Regulations.

(i) Partner–Agent Model:

### **Box 16.3** People's Rural Health Promotion Scheme: A Successful People-managed Health Programme in India

People's Rural Education Movement (PREM) is a non-profit making voluntary organizationin Orissa since 1984. In 1992 it extended its operations to Andhra Pradesh and in 2004 to Tamil Nadu, Jharkhands, and Chhattisgarh.

The primary objectives of PREM's development programmes are to spread education, improve healthcare, and implement livelihood and good governance initiatives among marginalized communities. Through PREM's direct intervention approximately 1,350,000 people in 6,500 communities have benefitted from a wide range of development initiatives.

PREM, with its network partnership of 152 independent voluntary and people's organizations, reaches more than 5,000,000 people in 23 districts of Orissa through various developmental programmes and campaigns Traditionally Adivasi, Dalit and fisher people are socially excluded in Orissa. Poverty, lack of awareness, and non-availability of facilities has resulted in non-accessibility of healthcare for such marginalized communities.

This has left members of the communities vulnerable to ill health and diseases such as malaria, which is endemic to parts of PREM's project area (and affects approximately 35per cent of the project population). Historically, infant and maternal mortality rates have been high due to a lack of pre-natal and delivery services, while TB, Sickle Cell anaemia, and water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea and typhoid, are major health hazards among the Adivasi and Dalit people.

PREM's experience in providing referral medical care to approximately 10,000 foster children, along with their siblings and family members, between 1996 and 2001 provided the organization with critical data on annual healthcare need and expenditure among its project population and enabled it to develop a vision for the wide-scale provision of healthcare facilities and services The challenge for the organization was to provide medical care in inaccessible areas and at the same time raise funds to support the treatment. In addressing this challenge PREM took the initiative to launch an experimental and innovative micro-insurance health scheme through village committees, called the People's Rural Health Promotion Scheme (PRHPS). The approach to operating the scheme was based on collecting a small annual premium fee from each and every member of the project population and use the collected funds to provide necessary healthcare.

A three-tier delivery system was formulated to provide healthcare in each village, at local Public Health Centres and, in referral cases, at district hospitals, medical colleges and private nursing homes as per necessity.

The pilot project was initiated in 500 villages with a target membership of 100,000 people, with each person, including children, paying ₹20 per for annual membership. In the process a sum of ₹2,000,000 was collected in the first year. Approximately `1,500,000 was spent in providing healthcare facilities to the project population and a sum of `500,000 per year, along with the returns from the investments, contributed to the corpus. It has been estimated that, long-term, PRHPS will become self-sustaining.

In the three-tiered delivery approach, village level pharmacies were developed in each of the 500 villages. Local young men were trained as para-medical activists to distribute medicines deposited at village pharmacies for the treatment of common ailments. Each village has a committee that makes decisions on cases requiring referral to Public Health Centres or local hospitals and management of the funds available. Those who need further treatment are helped to attend Public Health Centres and hospitals which are run by the government.

The results of the pilot project showed that about 75per cent of reported ailments were cured though first line intervention at village pharmacy level, where 15 to 20 types of medicines are available. In cases where illness continued for two to three days, the patients visited Public Health Centres where another 15per cent–20per cent of cases were cured. Only 5–10 per cent of the cases were referred to district level hospitals, medical colleges, or private nursing homes as per the necessity. The scheme bears the expenditure incurred for purchase of medicines and fees for hospitalization to a maximum level of  $\bar{\tau}$ 3,600 per member per year.

In 2007 the International Labour Organization (ILO) conducted a study on a number of people-managed healthcare projects, including PRHPS. In its report ILO described PRHPS as 'one of the best case studies' in Asia.

Subsequently, PREM was invited by the Ministry of Labour, Government of India, to make a presentation about the programme to policy makers. In April 2008, the Government of India implemented a similar programme on a massive scale.

  - SBI Life Grameen Shakti

**Development Goal** To enable micro insurance to be an integral part of the country's wider insurance system, it is necessary to

- adapt insurance companies to the requirements of the micro-insurance;
- link them as wholesale institutions to self-help groups (SHGs) as retailers; and
- upgrade SHGs to the level of financial cooperatives or village banks.

The functions that need to be focused on include: providing guidance to members, collecting premium instalments from members, insurance service to members, communication and exchange of experience, providing linkages with banks, NGOs or donors, supporting the proposals of individual members to insurance companies through recommendations.

**Micro Insurance Product** A 'life micro insurance product' means any term insurance contract with or without return of premium, any endowment insurance contract or health insurance contract, with or without an accident benefit rider, either on individual or group basis.

There are around fifty two products offered by all registered non-life insurance companies targeting low-income segment of the population, e.g., Cattle Micro Insurance, Kisan Agriculture Pumpset Micro Insurance Policy, Janata Personal Accident Sukshma Bima Policy, Silkworm Sukshma Bima Policy, Sheep & Goat Micro Insurance Policy, Sampoorna Griha Suraksha Policy, etc. Further, general insurance policies issued to micro, small and medium enterprises as classified in MSMED Act, 2006 under various lines of general insurance business will also be qualified as general micro insurance business upto `10,000 premium p.a. per MSM enterprise.

**Distribution of Micro Insurance Products** Micro insurance products may be distributed by individual insurance agents or corporate insurance agents or insurance brokers or micro insurance agents. A 'micro insurance agent' shall be an NGO or an SHG.

- A Non-Government Organization (NGO) shall be registered non-profit organization under the Society's Act, 1968 with a proven track record of working with marginalized groups with clearly stated aims and objectives, transparency, and accountability outlined in its memorandum, rules and regulations, and demonstrates involvement of committed people.
- An SHG may be an informal group or registered under the Societies Act, State Cooperative Act or as a partnership firm, consisting of 10 to 20 members with a proven track record of working with marginalized groups with clearly stated aims and objectives, transparency, and accountability outlined in its memorandum, rules and regulations and demonstrates involvement of committed people.
- The minimum number of members comprising a group should be atleast ten for insurance of individuals, and atleast twenty for group insurance.

In order to promote micro insurance in various segments, the IRDA has permitted more entities or individuals to be appointed as micro insurance agents which include Non-Government Organisations
(NGO), Self-Help Groups (SHG), Micro-Finance Institution (MFI), RBI regulated NBFCMFIs, District Cooperative Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Urban Co-operative banks, Business correspondents, Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies and Other Cooperative Societies.

#### **Other salient features of the Regulations include**

- The model adopted for micro-insurance is the principal/agent model.
- Micro-insurance sold would be recognized while reckoning the social and rural sector obligations.
- The minimum qualification for appointment as an insurance agent is removed and the requirement of hundred hours of training followed by an examination is waived.
- The insurance company has to impart twenty-five hours of training to micro insurance agent as part of capacity building'
- All products designed to be sold as micro insurance products have to be cleared by the Authority and have to clearly identify themselves as micro insurance products when launched in the market.
- The insurance contracts are to be delivered in local language to the policy holders
- All micro insurance product will necessarily be underwritten by insurance companies only.

# **Future of Micro Insurance**

Insurance outreach in India is quite modest—to say the least. A large section of the insurable population is still waiting to be insured for something as elementary as life. In such a situation, the potential appears to be lucrative. However, issues like transaction costs, balancing scale and diversity and capacity-building of deliverers and masses remain. Better operational efficiency, convergence with other activities like micro finance and adherence to neatly designed business plans could be possible answers but they are by no means easy to implement at the ground level.

A regulatory frame work also has a role in development of nascent areas like micro insurance. Presence of a regulation aimed at policy holders' protection can go a long way in promoting micro insurance. As a first step, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) came up with IRDA (Micro insurance) Regulations in 2005 but much more needs to be done.

Micro Insurance being a low-price high volume business, its success and sustainability depends mainly on keeping the transactions costs down. Obligations of insurers in respect of rural and social sector, which have also contributed a lot in development and promotion of micro insurance products by insurers in India. During 2010-2012, micro insurance in India witnessed an annual growth rate of 30% and accounted for almost 70% of the growth in micro insurance in Asia. This increase could be largely attributed to high economic growth, a rise in disposable income amongst the low-income households, varied products, alternative distribution channels, use of technology and efficient claims processes which have enabled cost-efficient scaling-up and servicing of micro insurance programs. Moreover, central and state governments have launched social security and health insurance schemes that have led the growth of micro insurance in India

On the positive side, increasing competition in the insurance sector offers good news for micro insurance. Commercial factors coupled with rural and social sector obligations of insurers are driving them to underwrite the hither denied 'bad' risks. Instead of pushing standard products, flexibility in terms of customized products is creeping in. Urban markets are fast getting saturated. Due to the congestion in urban markets, service providers are compelled to think of rural-centric solutions. So, micro insurance, as a sector is going to be the obvious beneficiary of this trend.

All in all, the outlook for micro insurance looks good despite its problems. In the coming years, we might see marketing of micro insurance being highly successful as it has taken place in micro finance.

### **SOCIAL INSURANCE IN INDIA**

Majority of the population belongs to lower income or people below the poverty line who do not have access to any kind of social security. It is now recognized that provision of social security is an obligation of the government. Various laws, passed by the government for this purpose involve use of insurance, compulsory or voluntary, as a tool of social security. Central and state governments contribute premiums under certain social security schemes thus fulfilling their social commitments. Social insurance is considered to be a type of social security, and in fact the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A government-sponsored plan of social insurance spreads the risk among all members of society so that no single family is completely ruined or deprived of livelihood by an interruption of, or end to sources of income. A government, on its own, cannot administer any social security scheme linked with insurance as it involves actuarial calculation of premiums and administering the claim process. These schemes require distributors in the form of banks and risk carriers in the form of insurance companies who would be enrolling and servicing these schemes.

Social security schemes are not new to India and they have been in vogue even before 2015.

The Employees State Insurance Act, 1948 provides for Employees State Insurance Corporation to pay for the expenses of sickness, disablement, maternity and death for the benefit of industrial employees and their families, who are insured persons. The scheme operates in certain industrial areas as notified by the government.

Commercial insurers play an important role in social security schemes sponsored by the government, such as

- 1. RKBY—Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana
- 2. RSBY—Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana
- 3. PMJBY—Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
- 4. PMSBY—Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana

All these benefit the community in general.

All the **rural insurance schemes**, operated on a commercial basis, are designed ultimately to provide social security to the rural families. The insurance industry itself offers on a commercial basis, insurance covers which have the ultimate objective of social security. Examples are Janata Personal Accident, Jan Arogya, etc.

### **Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana**

The government has also launched various health schemes and some of them applicable to particular states. It has launched national schemes in association with insurance companies and one such scheme is Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). It has been launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India, to provide health insurance coverage for the Below Poverty Line (BPL) families.

Following are the features of Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana:

- Total sum insured of  $\text{\textsterling}30,000$  per BPL family on a family floater basis.
- Pre-existing diseases to be covered.
- Coverage of health services related to hospitalization and services of surgical nature which can be provided on a day-care basis.
- Cashless coverage of all eligible health services.
- Provision of smart card.
- Provision of pre- and post-hospitalization expenses.
- Transport allowance of  $\bar{\tau}100$ /- per visit.
- The central and state government pays the premium to the insurer.
- Insurers are selected by the state government on the basis of a competitive bidding.
- Choice to the beneficiary between public and private hospitals.
- Premium to be borne by the central and state governments in the proportion of 3:1. Central government to contribute a maximum amount of  $\overline{5}565$ /- per family.
- Contribution by the state governments: 25 per cent of the annual premium and any additional premium beyond  $\overline{5750}$ .
- Beneficiary to pay  $\overline{530}$  per annum as registration fee/renewal fee.
- Administrative cost to be borne by the state government.
- Cost of smart card additional amount of  $\overline{60}/$  per beneficiary would be available for this purpose.
- The scheme shall commence operation from the first of the month after the next month from the date of issue of smart card. Thus, if the initial smart cards are issued anytime during the month of February in a particular district, the scheme will commence from 1st of April.
- The scheme will last for one year till 31st March of next year. This would be the terminal date of the scheme in that particular district. Thus, cards issued during the intervening period will also have the terminal date as 31st March of the following year.

Claim settlement to be done through TPA's mentioned in the schedule or by the insurance company. The settlement is to be made cashless as far as possible through listed hospitals.

Any one illness will be deemed to mean continuous period of illness and it includes relapse within 60 days from the date of last consultation with the hospital.

**Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY):** The government through the budget speech announced three ambitious social security schemes pertaining to the insurance and pension sectors, namely Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) a move towards creating a universal social security system, targeted especially for the poor and the underprivileged. These schemes are a move towards financial inclusion under the umbrella of Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) which was launched on 28th August, 2014.

Hon'ble prime minister launched PMJJBY and PMSBY schemes nationally in Kolkata on 9th May, 2015. The Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is a one year life insurance scheme, renewable from year-to-year, offering coverage for death due to any reason and is available to people in the age group of 18 to 50 years (life cover up to age 55) having a savings bank account who give their consent to join and enable auto-debit. The risk cover on the lives of the enrolled persons has commenced from 1st June 2015. It is a term life insurance policy.

Under PMJJBY scheme, life cover of  $\overline{z}2$  lakhs is available for a one year period stretching from 1st June to 31st May at a premium of  $\overline{3}330'$ - per annum per member and is renewable every year. It is offered/ administered through LIC and other Indian private life insurance companies. For enrolment, banks have tied up with insurance companies. Participating bank is the master policy holder.

As it is known that a large proportion of the population have no accidental insurance cover, the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) is aimed at covering the uncovered population at a highly affordable premium of just  $\bar{\tau}12$  per year. The scheme will be available to people in the age group 18 to 70 years with a savings bank account who give their consent to join and enable auto-debit on or before 31st May for the coverage period 1st June to 31st May on an annual renewal basis. Under the said scheme, risk coverage available will be  $\bar{\mathfrak{Z}}$  lakh for accidental death and permanent total disability and  $\bar{\mathfrak{Z}}$  lakh for permanent partial disability, for a one year period stretching from 1st June to 31st May. It is offered by public sector general insurance companies or any other general insurance company who are willing to offer the product on similar terms with necessary approvals and tie up with banks for this purpose. Participating bank will be the master policy holder on behalf of the participating subscribers. It will be the responsibility of the participating bank to recover the appropriate annual premium in one instalment, as per the option, from the account holders on or before the due date through 'auto-debit' process and transfer the amount due to the insurance company.

These schemes have been able to achieve a decent scale by enrolling bank account holders especially, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account holders. This happened on account of mobilization by a good number of insurance companies to carry the risk as well as banks to distribute these products. These schemes could not make much impact due to poor advertisement and lack of awareness of the schemes in rural areas. Insurance companies and banks took very little interest in popularizing these schemes since the cost of servicing the schemes and settling the claims was perceived to be higher. In 2016–17, the second year of its operation, claims under the PMJJBY scheme exceeded premiums by 21 per cent, making it unsustainable. An even worse outcome afflicted the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, which provides payment of  $\bar{\mathfrak{T}}$  lakh for accidental deaths or grievous injuries. In this case, claims were a whopping 70 per cent higher than premiums. By contrast, private insurance companies with similar insurance policies have a claims rate less than half the premiums.

#### **Mutual Insurance**

Poor people are more vulnerable to risks and also there is no preparedness on their part to mitigate the risks, which in turn creates a vicious circle of poverty. The government initiated certain programmes for extension of social protection in the form of insurance and pension to lower income groups. The government used its extensive rural banking infrastructure, post office and LICs agent network to distribute subsidized insurance products to low income households. This distribution network faced several challenges including accessing remote areas, reluctance of the poor to buy these products due to liquidity constraints and lack of insurance literacy. In the 1990s, NGOs and MFIs entered the insurance market by offering customized products and educating poor rural households. India's first micro-finance institution SEWA bank offers gender sensitive micro insurance—Vimo SEWA—a sustainable micro insurance.

Mutual insurance also known as community based health insurance is community-owned and governed, owned and run with member participation. It has regular engagement with its members and is designed for long-term financial sustainability

There are 15 mutuals and cooperatives, across 13 states, providing insurance services to approximately 1 million people using risk retention or risk sharing models. The other players in India are Uplift mutuals, IFFCO Tokio, Dhan Foundation, Shepherd and Goat Trust. Uplift mutuals has a strong ground presence in Pune and good governance

Low-income families have formed cooperatives mostly with women as policy holders engaged in the – made design and delivery of tailor insurance products. Moreover, the focus is on making the claims process easy and transparent. Members invest resources in insurance education and awareness to increase their membership and also have robust grievance redressal systems. These mutuals may not have the desired scale but have been able to show clear impact in protecting the lives and livelihoods of the poor by bringing insurance services to those who previously didn't have access to them.

Mutual insurance is likely to remain an area of interest in the years to come, notwithstanding its inherent problems of scalability and financial viability besides the inability to offer inorganic growth. Expanding outreach among the low-income populations beyond the captive catchments of compulsory and subsidized models will compel a persevered endeavor on the voluntary side. The insurance regulator IRDA has promulgated the micro insurance regulations for rapid penetration of insurance among the poor and low income people in rural and urban areas. Despite all these efforts, still a majority of the lowincome group have low access to insurance.

### **Conclusion**

With deregulation, competition has increased in the insurance sector. The entry of private sector players has brought about a paradigm shift in the definition of the word insurance. There is no doubt that the insurance market is growing. The rate of annual growth is an average of 20 per cent for life and 15 per cent for non-life. Despite this growth rate, India is under-insured when compared to other countries. As per the survey conducted by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Indian insurance market is one of the least insured markets in the world. India has a population of 1,044.15 million out of which only 100 million Indians have a life insurance policy. Almost 300 million people in the country can afford to buy life insurance but of this only 20 per cent have an insurance cover. A huge chunk of the population is yet to be tapped. India's life insurance premium as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is 4 per cent as against 8.18 per cent in the UK, 11 per cent in the US, and 14 per cent in South Africa. Indian insurance is ranked 38 in the world with a low insurance penetration of 3.96 per cent and a paltry 5 per cent being spent on insurance out of the average savings rate of 35 per cent. The ratio of sum assured to an individual's annual income is around 0.5 in India, while in developed countries, it averages around three.

India's insurance sector has a long way to catch up with the rest of the world. The current size of the Indian insurance market is USD 56 billion, while the global insurance market is around USD 4,270 billion. India accounts for just 1.32 per cent of the global insurance market, while the per capita insurance premium in India is USD 53, it is USD 5,167 in Japan, USD 9,785 in South Korea, USD 5,167 in Japan and USD 174 in China. The ratio of premium to GDP for India stands at only 3.96 per cent against 8.2 per cent in the US, 13 per cent in UK and 12.2 per cent in South Korea.

The untapped potential reveals that our human and physical assets are unprotected and neglected. Insurance penetration can be achieved by tapping the neglected rural markets. There is vast potential for insurance growth in the rural sector. A recent survey by the Foundation for Research, Training and Education in Insurance (FORTE) suggests that insurance can be sold profitably to rural communities in India. The survey revealed the following:

- There is a distinct hierarchy of needs in rural areas.
- Rural people find security in groups.
- The saving habit is very strong in rural areas.
- Average savings across the three most important socio-economic strata comes to 30–35 per cent of annual income or about  $\overline{513,500}$  annually which is significant.
- There is a high level of awareness about life insurance and a fairly high level—about 36 per cent already own life insurance.
- Fifty-one per cent of those who own life insurance would like to buy more.
- Amongst the savers, a significant percentage does not save through formal financial modes or institutions.
- Rural buyers of insurance prefer a half-yearly mode of premium payment to coincide with the time of harvest.

India and China have been picked as the 'most promising insurance markets' in a recent study by Swiss Re, one of the world's largest life and health reinsurers. Although China and India accounted for just 4.62 per cent of the global insurance premiums, their huge economies and population size are supposedly capable of creating 'ample opportunities for insurance'. The Swiss Re study ranked India in the thirty eighth position among the life insurance market and seventy eighth in the non-life insurance market in the world.

A faster growth of insurance in the rural sector can be achieved by insurance companies if they tie up with cooperative societies, regional rural banks, Kisan credit cardholders, self-help groups, NGOs, panchayats, and agents to distribute insurance products. This tie-up would help the insurance companies achieve insurance penetration in a cost-effective manner.
