# **INTRODUCTION**

The debt market is one of the most critical components of the financial system of any economy and acts as the fulcrum of a modern financial system. The debt market in most developed countries is many times bigger than the other financial markets, including the equity market. The US bond market is more than USD 35 trillion in size with a turnover exceeding 500 billion daily, representing the largest securities market in the world. The size of the world bonds market is close to USD 47 trillion which is nearly equivalent to the total GDP of all the countries in the world.

The total size of the Indian debt market is currently estimated to be in the range of USD 150 billion to 200 billion. India's debt market accounts for approximately 30 per cent of its GDP. The Indian bond market, measured by the estimated value of the bonds outstanding, is next only to the Japanese and Korean bond markets in Asia. The Indian debt market, in terms of volume, is larger than the equity market. In terms of the daily settled deals, the debt and the forex markets currently (2012–13) command a volume of  $\overline{5575}$  bn against a meagre  $\overline{5133}$ bn in the equity markets.

In the post-reforms era, a fairly well-segmented debt market has emerged comprising the following:

- Private corporate debt market
- Public sector undertaking bond market
- Government securities market

The government securities market accounts for more than 90 per cent of the turnover in the debt market. It constitutes the principal segment of the debt market.

# **History of the Indian Debt Market**

The Indian debt market has traditionally been a wholesale market with participation restricted to a few institutional players—mainly banks. Banks were the major participants in the government securities market due to statutory requirements. The turnover in the debt market too was quite low at a few hundred crores till the early 1990s. The debt market was fairly underdeveloped due to the administered interest rate regime and the availability of investment avenues which gave a higher rate of return to investors.

In the early 1990s, the government needed a large amount of money for investment in development and infrastructure projects. The government realized the need of a vibrant, efficient, and healthy debt market and undertook reform measures. The Reserve Bank put in substantial efforts to develop the government securities market but its two segments, the private corporate debt market and public sector undertaking bond market, have not yet fully developed in terms of volume and liquidity.

The debt market plays a key role in the efficient mobilization and allocation of resources in the economy, financing the development activities of the government, transmitting signals for implementation of the monetary policy, facilitating liquidity management in tune with both short-term and long-term objectives, and pricing of non-government securities in financial markets.

It is the debt market which can provide returns commensurate to the risk, a variety of instruments to match the risk and liquidity preferences of investors, greater safety, and lower volatility. Hence, the debt market has a lot of potential for growth in the future. The debt market is critical to the development of a developing country like India which requires a large amount of capital for achieving industrial and infrastructure growth.

**Regulation of the Debt Market** The RBI regulates the government securities market and money market while the corporate debt market comes under the purview of the Securities Exchange and Board of India (SEBI).

In order to promote an orderly development of the market, the government issued a notification on March 2, 2000, delineating the areas of responsibility between the Reserve Bank and the SEBI. The contracts for sale and purchase of government securities, gold related securities, money market securities and securities derived from these securities, and ready forward contracts in debt securities shall be regulated by the RBI. Such contracts, if executed on the stock exchanges shall, however, be regulated by SEBI in a manner that is consistent with the guidelines issued by the RBI.

## **Link Between the Money Market and the Debt Market**

The money market is a market dealing in short-term debt instruments (upto one year) while the debt market is a market for long-term debt instruments (more than one year). The money market supports the long-term debt market by increasing the liquidity of securities. A developed money market is a prerequisite for the development of a debt market.

# **Characteristics of the Debt Market**

The characteristics of an efficient debt market are a competitive market structure, low transaction costs, a strong and safe market infrastructure and a high level of heterogeneity among market participants. An efficient debt market helps in reducing the borrowing cost of the government, reducing the pressure on institutional financing by providing greater funding avenues, enhancing mobilization of resources by unlocking unproductive investment like gold, and developing a stable yield curve.

# **Participants in the Debt Market**

The participants in the debt market are a small number of large players which has resulted in the debt market evolving into a wholesale market. Most primary debt issues are privately placed or auctioned to the participants while secondary market dealings are negotiated over the telephone. The NSE Wholesale Debt Market Segment (WDM) has emerged as an active platform for trading in debt instruments. Recently, the BSE also started trading in debt instruments. The primary dealers act as market makers in the government securities market. The debt market has become more diversified with the entry of new participants such as high net worth individuals, cooperative banks, large corporates, mutual funds, and insurance companies.

The major participants in the debt market are as follows:

**• Central and state governments:** The central government raises money through the issue of dated securities and treasury bills to finance the budget deficit and other short-term and long-term financial requirements. The Reserve Bank is the investment banker, which performs the task of raising money and issuing securities on behalf of the government.

The state government, municipalities, and local bodies also issue securities to finance their budgetary deficits and developmental projects,

- **Primary dealers:** They are market makers appointed by the Reserve Bank and have emerged as active intermediaries in the government securities market and money market.
- **Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs):** They issue tax-free and taxable bonds to meet their longterm and working capital needs. They also invest in debt securities to park their surplus funds.
- **Corporates:** They are both issuers and investors in the debt market.
- **Banks:** They are the captive investors in the government securities market. They participate both as lenders and borrowers in the call money market and as arrangers and investors in the commercial paper market. They issue certificates of deposits (CDs) to finance their short-term requirements and bonds to finance their long-term requirements.

#### **Box 10.1** Risks Associated with Debt Securities and Trading in Debt Securities

#### **Risks associated with debt securities:**

- Default/Credit Risk: The issuer of a debt security may be unable to make timely payment of interest or principal amount or comply with the provision of a bond indenture.
- Interest Rate Risk: Risk arising from an adverse change in the interest rate which affects the yield on the existing instruments.
- Reinvestment Rate Risk: The probability of a fall in the interest rate resulting in lack of options to invest the interest received at regular intervals at higher rates or at comparable rates in the market.

### **Risks associated with trading in debt securities:**

- Counter-party Risk: Risk arising due to the inability of the opposite party to the contract to deliver either the promised security or the sale value at the time of settlement.
- Price Risk: Risk arising on account of the inability to receive the expected price due to an adverse movement in the prices.

*Source:* BSE

- **Mutual funds:** Mutual funds are the predominant investors, in the debt market. They have specialized debt funds such as money market mutual funds, gilt funds, and so on. They have also emerged as active participants and traders in the debt market.
- **Insurance companies:** They have been permitted to invest in the debt market and the limits of investment have been specified by the IRDA.
- **Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs):** They have been permitted to invest in government securities and corporate bonds. The limits of their investment have been specified.
- **Provident Funds (PFs) and pension funds:** They are large investors in government securities and PSU bonds. They are not active traders in their portfolios.
- **Charitable institutions and trusts:** They are large investors in government securities and bonds specified in the bye-laws governing them. They are also not active traders in their portfolios. Satellite dealers (SDs) were also one of the participants in the debt market but the Reserve Bank discontinued their participation from May 2002.

In the government securities market, the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) has replaced the system of negotiations through telephones. The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has revolutionized the clearing and settlement system in the government securities market. Both the NDS and the CCIL have brought about a radical transformation in the debt market similar to that brought about by NSE in the equity market.

# **Types of Instruments Traded in the Debt Market**

The different types of instruments traded in the debt market can be classified into the following segments:

| <b>Market Segment</b>        | Issuer                                          | <i>Instruments</i>                                                                                                                  |

# **Dematerialization of Debt Securities**

The government abolished stamp duty on debt securities to boost the dematerialization of debt securities and enhance levels of trading in corporate debt securities. Both the NSDL and the CDSL were permitted to admit debt instruments to the depository. The debt instruments include debentures, bonds, commercial papers, and certificate of deposit, irrespective of whether these instruments are listed, unlisted or privately placed.

With dematerialization, it has become possible for banks to sell securities in smaller lots to corporate clients, provident funds, trusts, and others. The cost of holding securities in demat form is negligible as most of the banks are depository participants (DPs) of NSDL. Moreover, these banks can STRIP these securities and create a retail market for the same.

With effect from October 31, 2001, banks, financial institutions, and primary dealers can make fresh investments in and hold bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in demat form.

## **Primary and Secondary Segments of Debt Market**

In the primary market, new debt issues are floated either through public prospectus, rights issue, or private placement. The private placement market is more attractive because the cost of raising a loan is only half of that of raising loans from the market. Under the current guidelines, corporates are required to report details of resources raised through private placements to the stock exchanges–BSE and NSE. This was aimed at giving investors a good idea of how the companies propose to use these funds and also guage the risk return allowed. In mid-2006, the US private placement market was opened up for Indian companies. Reliance Industries Limited became the first Indian company to tap the US private placement market, raising \$300 million through a 10–12 year loan. More Indian companies are likely to tap this market.

The debt instruments are traded on the OTCEI, the BSE, and the WDM segment of the NSE. The BSE is the first exchange in the country to provide an electronic trading platform for corporate and other nongovernment debt securities through the order-matching system. The clearing and settlement of the trades is undertaken through the clearing house of the exchange.

At present, bond deals in India are struck over phones, following which the players report the transactions on NDS. The negotiated dealing system (NDS) is used predominantly as a reporting platform. The RBI wants the price discovery, order matching and deals to take place on the NDS. The BSE, NSE and FIMMDA have launched trading and reporting platforms to promote transparency in corporate debt market. FIMMDA is the reporting platform while NSE and BSE serve as both trading and reporting platforms.

The National Stock Exchange of India Ltd set up a separate segment for trading in debt securities known as the Wholesale Debt Market segment of the exchange. In fact, the NSE commenced operations in June 1994 with the WDM segment of the exchange. Prior to the commencement of trading in the WDM segment of the NSE, the only trading mechanism available in the debt market was the telephone. The NSE provided, for the first time in the country, an online, automated, screen-based system known as NEAT (National Exchange for Automated Trading) across a wide range of debt instruments. NEAT supports an anonymous order-driven market and also provides on-line market information system.

In the WDM trading system, there are two markets: (a) Continuous Market, and (b) Negotiated Market. In the continuous market, the buyer and seller do not know each other and they put their orders. If the orders match, it results in a trade which is settled directly between the participants. In the NEAT-WDM system, all participants can set up their counter-party exposure limits against all probable counter-parties which enables them to reduce/minimize the counter-party risk. In the negotiated market, trades take place outside the exchange but are reported to the Exchange and disclosed to the market through NEAT-WDM system. In the negotiated market, no counter-party exposure limit needs to be involved as the participants are familiar with each other.This system is an order-driven system which matches the best buy and sell orders on a price time priority and simultaneously protects the identity of the buyer and the seller. Trading under this system leads to a risk-free, efficient price mechanism and transparency.

Initially, government securities, T-bills, and bonds issued by public sector undertakings were made available for trading. Now this range has been widened to include non-traditional instruments, such as floating rate bonds, zero coupon bonds, index bonds, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, corporate debentures, state government loans, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions and local bodies, units of mutual funds, and securitized debt.

On the NSE-WDM segment, brokers are involved merely in order execution for their clients. Besides brokers, there are two types of entities in this segment: trading members and participants. Trading membership is open to corporates, subsidiaries of banks and financial institutions, satellite dealers and primary dealers who have a minimum net worth of  $\bar{\tau}2$  crore. They can place orders and execute trades on the system. Participants take direct settlement responsibility for trade executed on the exchange on their behalf by an NSE trading member. • The private placement market for debt issues is popular because the cost of raising funds is low.

- government securities are settled on T+1 basis from May 24, 2005. In case of repo transactions in government securities, the first leg can be settled either on  $T+0$  basis or  $T+1$  basis. All outright transactions of nongovernment securities can be settled up to T+2. All trade in government securities is reported to RBI-SGL through the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) or the order matching of RBI. The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) provides settlement guarantee for transactions in government securities including repos. The trades are settled on a net basis through the DVP-III system while the trades for non-government securities are settled on a gross basis directly between participants on delivery versus payment basis. The settlement cycle for government securities was standardized to T+1 from May 11, 2005.

Participants comprise large investors such as banks, primary dealers, and institutions who are not members of

The government security trade on the WDM segment could be outright trade or repo transactions with a flexibility for varying days of settlement which, in turn, is to be clearly specified. However, for nongovernment securities only outright transactions are allowed. All outright secondary market transactions in

NSE and therefore, cannot directly transact but effect transactions through the NSE-WDM segment.

# **THE PRIVATE CORPORATE DEBT MARKET**

The private corporate sector needs large amounts of long-term funds for expansion, modernization, restructuring operations and mergers/acquisitions. It can raise funds through equity and debt. Equity is risk capital and there are limits to which a corporate can raise funds through equity shares. Corporates need to diversify funding sources. Hence, they can raise capital either through long-term borrowings from banks and financial institutions or by issuing debentures/bonds in the debt market. Banks do lend long-term loans but they do not have the capacity nor the appetite for such long-term loans. Moreover, lending a large number of longterm loans would create asset-liability mismatch problem for the banks as banks accept short-term deposits. But, banks would be willing to invest in 10 to 20 years bonds issued by corporates if they have an exit route, *i.e.*, they are in a position to sell the bonds when they need the money. This exit route is provided by the corporate bond market. The corporate debt market is a market wherein debt securities of corporates are issued and traded therein. A well-developed corporate bond market enables corporates to raise long-term capital for long-gestation projects/acquisitions at a lower cost and thereby aid in economic growth. The corporate debt market supplements the banking system. It enables a better asset-liability match for both corporates and banks. Moreover, rating of debt securities by credit rating agencies helps in increasing investor confidence, which, in turn, enables investors to hold a diversified portfolio consisting of both debt and equity instruments. As investors such as mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies need a steady flow of income to cater to the varying needs of their customers, they are major investors in this market. An active corporate debt market fosters market discipline and nurtures credit culture.

Corporates have resorted heavily to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to meet their fund requirements at lower cost. This could increase the vulnerability of corporates to both currency and liquidity risks and become a source of the transmission of severe external shocks to the domestic economy. Therefore, it is important to develop the domestic corporate bond market to enable corporates to meet a substantial part of their funds requirement domestically.

Moreover, Corporate debt market can provide small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with an alternative avenue for sourcing funds besides bank financing. An access to active debt market would require rating which would help SMEs become more transparent and follow proper accounting, governance and disclosure practices.

The Committee on Infrastructure Financing (Chairman: Shri Deepak Parekh) has estimated that  $\overline{51.46}$  trillion would be required for infrastructure development during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17) and that 47 per cent of the funds could come through the PPP route. According to the High Powered Expert Group Committee (Chairperson: Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia) India will need to invest  $\overline{539,187}$ billion between 2012 and 2031 to meet its urban infrastructure requirements. An active corporate bond market could enable market for municipal bonds issued by the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

SEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 define 'debt securities' as non-convertible debt securities which create or acknowledge indebtedness, and include debenture, bonds and such other securities of a body corporate or any statutory body constituted by virtue of a legislation, whether constituting a charge on the assets of the body corporate or not, but excludes bonds issued by Government or such other bodies as may be specified by the SEBI, security receipts and securitized debt instruments.

The investors in this market are banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, retirement funds, provident funds, and foreign institutional investors.

Private sector companies raise funds from the debt market by issuing debentures. These debentures may be convertible debentures, which can be converted into equity (partially or fully convertible debentures), or non-convertible debentures (NCDs). These are governed by the provisions of the Companies

• The private corporate debt market is a market wherein debt securities of corporates are issued and traded.

#### **Significance of the Corporate Debt Market**

- Aids in economic growth by providing long-term capital.
- Supplements the banking system.
- A stable source of finance.
- Reduces cost of capital of corporates.
- Fosters market discipline and nurtures credit culture.
- Enables investors to hold a diversified portfolio.
- Enables a better asset-liability match for banks and corporates.
- Facilitates infrastructure financing.
- Enables development of the municipal bond market.

Act. Interest on these debentures is calculated on an actual 365-day basis. Tax deduction at source (TDS) is applicable. Convertible bonds is a preferred source of raising funds in volatile markets. In 2007, India was the fourth most active market in the world in convertible debenture issuances.

Corporates adopt either the public offering route or the private placement route for issuing debentures/ bonds. The public issues of debentures are open to all investors and allotment is made on a pro-rata basis. Coupon rates are fixed by the issuer and lead manager prior to the offering. In the case of privately placed debentures, the terms of the issue are decided by negotiations between issuers and bidders. Some privately placed debt instruments are subsequently listed on stock exchanges.

The private corporate sector has designed a hybrid variety of instruments combining the features of both debt and equity. A wide variety of instruments with longer maturity and with call and put options have been issued by the private corporate sector. Many corporates have issued floating rate bonds (FRBs), besides fixed rate bonds.

# **Regulatory Agencies Responsible for Regulating Different segments of the Corporate Debt Market**

The SEBI is responsible for primary market (public issues as well as private placements by listed companies) and secondary market (OTC as well as exchange) for the corporate debt market.

The RBI is responsible for the market for repo/reverse repo transactions in corporate debt. However, if it is traded on exchanges, trading and settlement procedure would be determined by the SEBI.

An issuer shall not make material modification to the structure of the debentures issued in terms of coupon, conversion, and redemption or otherwise without prior approval of the stock exchanges where they are listed. The stock exchanges would also ensure that such information relating to modification or proposed modification is disseminated on the exchange website.
- ii. The companies issuing debentures and the respective debenture trustees/stock exchanges shall disseminate all information regarding the debentures to the investors and the general public by issuing a press release and also displaying the details on their respective websites, in the event of:
  - Default by issuer to pay interest/redemption amount;
  - Failure to create a charge on the assets; and
  - Revision of rating assigned to the debentures.
- iii. Issuer shall make public, information/reports on debentures issued including compliance reports filed by companies and debenture trustees by placing them on websites of the companies and the debenture trustees. The same is also to be submitted to stock exchanges for dissemination through their websites.
- 15. The debt securities issued to the public or on a private placement basis, which are listed in recognized stock exchanges, shall be traded and such trades shall be cleared and settled in recognized stock exchanges. In case of trades of debt securities which have been made over the counter, such trades shall be reported on a recognized stock exchange having a nation wide trading terminal or such other platform as may be specified by the SEBI.

## **The Primary Market for Corporate Debt**

Debt issues were very popular till 1991–92. With the initiation of reforms and the development of equity cult, the proportion of debt issues in the total capital issues declined in the subsequent years.

Debt issues comprise debentures and bonds. Convertible debentures were popular in 2001–02 as against non-convertible debentures which dominated the debt market in the preceding three years from 1998–99 to 2000–01. Earlier, 20 per cent to 30 per cent of bond issues were 'bought-out' in nature, while the rest was normal private placement. Bought-out deals flooded the bond market in 2002. In a boughtout deal, the entire issue is picked up by a single investor. It is unlike a private placement where a debt paper is sold to several investors. Corporates do not prefer the private placement route because in a private placement, the issuer has to circulate the information memorandum to different market players and keep the bidding open for about five days. During these five days, the market can change due to fresh political uncertainties, border tensions, or an interest rate view aired by a central banker. A bought-out deal avoids all these and hence has become a preferred route for corporates. In a bought-out deal, funds can be raised within a very short time and with little disclosure.

The average annual issuance in the private corporate bond market is close to  $\overline{(*)}70,000$  crore predominantly through private placements.

## **The Secondary Market for Corporate Debt**

Corporate debt securities are traded either on over the counter (OTC) as bilateral agreements or on a stock exchange through brokers. SEBI prohibits negotiated deals in respect of corporate listed debt securities. Trades of listed debt securities are to be executed on the basis of price and order matching mechanism of stock exchanges. The corporate debt securities are traded on the WDM segment of NSE, OTCEI, and on the BSE (w.e.f. January 9, 1996).

SEBI has set up a reporting platform for post-trade transparency and introduced DvP in settlement of OTC trades in corporate bonds to eliminate settlement risk. It has allowed setting up of dedicated debt segment on the exchangesBanks and PDs allowed by RBI to become members of stock exchanges to trade in corporate bonds.

Investment norms for banks and PDs have been relaxed by RBI to facilitate investment in corporate bonds.

 Measures have been taken by SEBI to encourage investor interest/participation in the corporate bond market in terms of liberalizing the listing requirements, simplification of procedures and processes and simplified disclosure norms

 Rationalisation of FPI regulations has been put in place by SEBI for easier registration process and operating framework for overseas entities seeking to invest in Indian capital markets.

 Issue of long-term bonds by banks allowed with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to (a) long term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (b) affordable housing. These bonds have been exempted from computation of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) and are therefore not been subjected to CRR/SLR requirements.

- The average size of issue of privately placed bonds in 2005–06 was around ₹90 crore, less than half of the average size of an equity issue.
- The corporate debt market accounts for 3.9 *per cent* of GDP in India, while it is 61 *per cent* in Korea and 37.5 *per cent* in Malaysia.

International financial institutions like IFC were permitted to float rupee linked bond overseas to deepen the off-shore rupee bond market so that IFC and other investors can raise rupees to invest in India. This has facilitated development of benchmark yield for long term corporate bonds.

The secondary market for corporate debt has not yet fully developed in India. The volumes traded are quite low. The average daily volumes in the corporate bond market is around  $\overline{2}2500$  crore which is low. On the BSE and the OTCEI, the volume of turnover is quite low, but the volume of turnover has picked up on the NSE-WDM segment.

The traded volume of debt was highest in the year 2004–05. A declining trend was witnessed in the subsequent years. However, the traded volume of debt increased substantially in the year 2016–17. The proportion of traded volume of debentures to total turnover is low and owing to this, the size of the corporate debt market is small.

The corporate debt market has a large potential to grow. The following are the problems and the measures that need to be taken to solve the problems:

- The absence of a risk-free term structure of interest rates has restricted the development of new and innovative instruments in the debt market. There is a need to develop a smooth yield curve for government securities market for efficient pricing of corporate bonds.
- The corporate bond market needs well-capitalized market makers just like the primary dealers in the government securities market. Market making should be encouraged to enhance liquidity.
- Cooperative banks and charitable trusts are permitted to invest in corporate paper but permissions are granted only on a case-to-case basis for each specific issue rather than on the basis of broad investment guidelines. These banks and trusts should be permitted to invest in good quality rated paper by laying down broad investment guidelines.
- Provident funds (PFs) currently hold funds close to  $\overline{1,00,000}$  crore. These funds are invested as per prescribed norms in government securities, state guaranteed papers, public sector debt, and recently in corporate bonds. PFs are traditionally risk-averse and hence have shied away from investing in private sector bonds. These PFs can be encouraged to invest in private sector bonds by assuring them better return and safety.
- The private placement of corporate bonds has restricted open market trading in these instruments. The private corporate bond market is a market with a small investor base, mainly institutional players such as mutual funds insurance companies and banks who hold on to the securities till their maturity. Moreover, they have low risk appetites, which make it increasingly difficult for lower rated-borrowers to raise debt directly. An active secondary market is needed for reaching a wider investor base, reducing borrowing costs, and lengthening maturities. Efforts should be made to activate the secondary market by increasing the number of players and instruments.
- Banks prefer to lend to corporates rather than subscribing to their debt issuances. Banks limit their investment in corporate bonds either due to credit risks or due to the limits on exposures to particular sectors. The corporate bonds held by banks can be sold to retail customers (investors) which banks do not do.
- There is a lack of uniform stamp duty structure. The stamp duty on debentures is 0.375 per cent ad valorem. Promissory notes attract a duty of 0.05 per cent. Further, stamp duty is different in different states for mortgage and assignment. Stamp duty should be lowered to reduce the cost of issue of bond paper. The R. H. Patil Committee on debt market reforms suggested that the maximum stamp duty should be 0.25 per cent ad valorem with a cap of  $\overline{2}25$  lakh for 7-year instrument.
- There are not enough underwriters for debt issuances leading to a decline in bond issues. Since early 2008, foreign banks have begun to cut down on underwriting issues because of tight liquidity conditions globally. Moreover, lack of investor demand for lower-rated paper led to a decline in underwriting fees. Hence, few firms are willing to offer underwriting services.
- Lack of investor awareness about the advantages of investing in rated debt instruments rather than unrated fixed deposits.
- The market for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and repos has not taken off.

A liquid and active corporate debt market can aid in industrial growth and reduce the pressure on institutional financing.

An active corporate bond market also helps in the diversification of risks in the financial system. In order to enable public and private sector firms to borrow for longer maturity periods in local currency to meet their investment needs and avoid balance sheet mismatches and foreign currency exposures, there is a need to accelerate the development of local currency bond market.

 An active corporate bond market could also provide institutional investors such as insurance companies and provident and pension funds with quality long term financial assets, helping them in matching their assets and liabilities.

A well-developed corporate debt market will enable the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to raise long-term finance. A well-functioning debt market allows appropriate risk-return pricing thereby attracting investors who are willing to take on higher risk for commensurate higher rewards.

## **Measures to Promote the Corporate Debt Market**

The interest rate ceiling on corporate debt has been removed and conversion has been made optional at the choice of the investor. The ceiling on bank investments in corporate debt has been removed. Banks were permitted to classify their investments in non-SLR bonds issued by companies engaged in infrastructure activities and having a minimum residual maturity of seven years under the Held to Maturity (HTM) category. The provisioning norms for banks for infrastructure loan accounts have been relaxed. Banks have been given flexibility to invest in unrated bonds of companies engaged in infrastructure activities within the overall ceiling of 10 per cent.

Listing of privately placed debt paper in the secondary market is allowed. It is possible now for the debt of a corporate to be listed even though the equity may not be listed.

Securitized debt paper has generated a great deal of interest and this paper is now traded in the secondary market. In December 2007, to facilitate the development of primary corporate debt market, the SEBI simplified issuance norms of corporate bonds by making the following changes:

- 1. For public/rights issues of bonds, issuers now need to obtain rating from only one credit rating agency instead of from two, so as to reduce the cost of issuances.
- 2. Bonds below investment grade are allowed to be issued to the public to suit the risk/return appetite of investors. The investor has to decide whether or not to invest in a non-investment grade debt instrument.
- 3. Structural restrictions currently placed on debt instruments such as those on maturity, put/call option on conversion, etc. were removed. This was done to provide issuers flexibility in structuring debt instruments to suit their requirements.

The BSE and NSE have launched trading and reporting platforms on January 1, and March 1, 2007, respectively, to capture all information related to trading in corporate bonds. Later, in September 2007, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) started Corporate Bond Trade Reporting Platform. The trade matching platform is now order driven with essential features of OTC market. Both the stock exchanges disseminate information relating to corporate bonds comprising issuer name, maturity date, current coupon, last price traded, last amount traded, last yield (annualized) traded, weighted average yield price, total amount traded, and the rating of the bond and any other additional information. They also provide their services for clearing and settlement of corporate bonds traded.

FIMMDA developed a reporting platform to promote transparency in corporate debt market. The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) is an association of Scheduled Commercial Banks, Public Financial Institutions, Primary Dealers and Insurance Companies and incorporated as a Company under section 25 of the Companies Act,1956 on June 3rd, 1998. FIM-MDA is a voluntary market body for development of the bond, money and derivatives markets. It represents market participants and acts as an interface with the regulators on various issues that impact the functioning of these markets. It also undertakes developmental activities, such as, introduction of benchmark rates and new derivatives instruments, etc. FIMMDA releases rates of various Government securities that are used by market participants for valuation purposes. FIMMDA also plays a constructive role in the evolution of best market practices by its members so that the market as a whole operates transparently as well as efficiently.

The shut period in corporate bonds has been reduced to align it with that applicable for Government Securities. The shut period in corporate bonds is similar to the record date in case of rights issues. Government securities/corporate bonds/debentures are traded in the secondary and hence keep changing hands. Issuer of debt securities pays interest to the holders registered in its register on a certain date known as record date. Securities are not transferred in the books of issuer during the period in which such records are updated for payment of interest etc. Such period is called as shut period. For government securities held in demat form (SGL), shut period is three working days. To bring about uniformity in shut periods for corporate bonds, SEBI in June 2011 directed exchanges to do away with shut period for interest payments or for part-redemptions. Further, SEBI directed exchanges to ensure that issuers have a record date not more than 15 days prior to book closure for all prospective privately placed issues of corporate bonds.

In September 2011, SEBI put in place framework for issue of Structured Products.

Structured products are issued in India as debt instruments with returns linked to equity or other underlying assets. In view of the nature of risk profile of such securities, additional disclosures were specified in offer documents for issue of structured products that seek listing on stock exchanges. Only issuers • The BSE, NSE and FIMMDA have launched trading and reporting platforms to Promote transparency in corporate debt market and building a credible date base.
that have a minimum net-worth of 100 crore are eligible to issue such instruments. Minimum ticket size for subscribing to such securities is  $\bar{\tau}10$  lakh. Other norms include additional disclosures pertaining to riskiness of such instruments, scenario analysis showing its value under various market conditions, commission structure embedded therein and requirements for primary issuance and sale of securities to retail investors. Third party valuation of such securities by a credit rating agency has been made mandatory and disclosed to the public.

Tradable lots in corporate bonds have been reduced to  $\bar{\tau}1$  lakh for all the entities. It has been made mandatory for all new issues of corporate bonds to have an actual day count convention. There are conventions for calculation of the number of days that has elapsed between two dates for payment of interest. The objective of any convention is to calculate (days in a month)/(days in a year). The actual number of days elapsed between the two dates may be divided by 360, or by 365 or by actual number of days in a year. Assume a bond with face value  $\bar{\tau}100$ , coupon 9.50 per cent, last coupon paid on June 15, 2008, and traded for value October 5, 2008. If the year is assumed to have 360 days, then the accrued interest is  $\overline{59.5}$ \* 112/360=2.9556. If the year is assumed to have 365 days, then the accrued interest is 2.9151.

Further, to streamline the process of interest and redemption payments, the RBI has allowed issuers the use of Electronic Clearing Services (ECS), Real time Gross Settlements (RTGS), or National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT).

In January 2008, Draft Regulations on Issue and Listing of Debt Securities were framed to provide for simplified regulatory framework for issuance and listing of non-convertible debt securities issued by any company, public sector undertaking, or statutory corporation. The salient features of the draft regulations include: (i) rationalization of disclosure requirements; (ii) enhanced responsibilities of merchant bankers for exercising due diligence; (iii) mandatory listing of private placement of debt by companies which were earlier not listed; (iv) reissuances of corporate debt; and (v) a proposal to introduce rationalized listing requirements for debt of a listed issuer. The regulations were notified on June 6, 2008.

The Finance Minister also proposed to exempt corporate debt instruments issued in demat form and listed on recognized stock exchanges from tax deducted at source (TDS).

The exposure norms for Primary Dealers (PDs) have been relaxed to enable them to play a larger role in the corporate bond market.

Credit Default Swaps (CDS) have been introduced on corporate bonds since December 01, 2011 to facilitate hedging of credit risk associated with holding corporate bonds and encourage investors participation in long term corporate bonds. CDS has been introduced with all safeguards, such as, not allowing naked CDS for the users, mandating position limits for the market makers, compulsory reporting of transactions to the trade repository in CCIL, publication of CDS curve for valuation, and standardization of contracts.

Revised guidelines have been issued for securitization of standard assets so as to develop bond market as well as provide investors a safe financial product. The interest of the originator has been aligned with the investor and suitable safeguards have been designed.

# **Change in investment Conditions/Restrictions for FPI Investments in Corporate Debt Securities**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made following changes in February, 2015:

- 1. All future investments within the USD 51 bn Corporate Debt limit category, including the limits vacated when the current investment by an FPI runs off either through sale or redemption, shall be required to be made in corporate bonds with a minimum residual maturity of three years.
- 2. Furthermore, FPIs shall not be permitted to invest in liquid and money market mutual fund schemes.
- 3. There will, however, be no lock-in period and FPIs shall be free to sell the securities (including those that are presently held with less than three years residual maturity) to domestic investors.

The corporates are preferring to raise funds through the corporate bond market thereby reducing their reliance on bank credit. The percentage share of the outstanding amount of corporate bonds has increased from 17 per cent in the financial year 2011–12 to 20 per cent in 2015–16, whereas the percentage share of the amount outstanding with respect to the bank credit has gradually declined from 73 per cent in 2011–12 to 65 per cent in the 2015–16.

Private placement debt issues out-scored public issues. Private placement continued to be the preferred route by investors for its perceived advantages of operational ease, minimal disclosures and lower costs. Finding ways to make public offerings more attractive will help to bring in the retail investors, and address the liquidity problem in this segment's secondary market.

Reporting platforms for corporate bonds are maintained by BSE, NSE and MSEI. Reporting of secondary market transactions in corporate bonds was discontinued at FIMMDA with effect from April 1, 2014. MSEI started the reporting in July 2013, but the volumes reported at the platform have been insignificant. NSE continues to be the largest reporting platform for OTC deals in corporate bond markets.

With effect from December 1, 2009, it has been made mandatory for all trades in corporate bonds between mutual funds, FPIs/sub-accounts, venture capital funds, foreign venture capital investors, portfolio managers, and RBI regulated entities (as specified by RBI) to be cleared and settled through the clearing corporations of exchanges–the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) or the Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) and the MSEI Clearing Corporation Limited (MSEI CCL).

In case of shortage of delivery, stock exchanges/clearing corporations may conduct financial closeout. The financial close out shall take place at the highest price on trade date (which becomes the trade price) with a 1% mark-up on trade price.

Further, exchanges/clearing corporation shall introduce a uniform auction mechanism to deal with settlement shortages by March 31, 2017.

#### **Partial credit enhancement to corporate bonds provided by banks during the lifetime of the bond:**

- (a) To be eligible for PCE from banks, corporate bonds shall be rated by a minimum of two external credit rating agencies at all times;
- (b) The rating reports, both initial and subsequent, shall disclose both standalone credit rating (i.e., rating without taking into account the effect of PCE) as well as the enhanced credit rating (taking into account the effect of PCE).
- (c) For the purpose of capital computation in the books of PCE provider, lower of the two standalone credit ratings and the corresponding enhanced credit rating of the same rating agency shall be reckoned.
- (d) Where the reassessed standalone credit rating at any time during the life of the bond shows improvement over the corresponding rating at the time of bond issuance, the capital requirement may be recalculated on the basis of the reassessed standalone credit rating and the reassessed enhanced credit rating, without reference to the constraints of capital floor and difference in notches.

As announced in the Union Budget 2016–17, the investment basket of eligible instruments for investment by FPIs under the corporate bond route has been expanded to include the following:

- (i) **Unlisted debt securities:** FPIs can invest in the primary issues of non-convertible debentures/ bonds by a public company issued in demat form, provided that the issuing company does not use the borrowing proceeds for real estate activities, purchase of land, investing in capital market or on-lending to other entities. The custodian banks of FPIs shall ensure compliance with this condition based on an undertaking from the issuing company.
- (ii) **Securitised Debt Instruments:** FPIs can invest in the following securitised debt instruments:
  - (i) any certificate or instrument issued by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up for securitisation of asset/s where banks, FIs or NBFCs are originators,
  - (ii) any certificate or instrument issued and listed in terms of the SEBI "Regulations on Public Offer and Listing of Securitised Debt Instruments, 2008

- (ii) Permitting brokers in corporate bond repos; and (iii) allowing consolidation and re-issuance of corporate bonds.

Due to these measures the turnover in the secondary corporate bond market has increased

The corporate debt market constitutes a small segment of the debt market despite measures taken to promote this market. A great deal of investor education is required for developing a retail corporate bond market. Retail investors need to be made aware of advantages of rated debt instruments and the use of interest rate futures to hedge their fixed income exposures. The development of corporate bond market calls for improving liquidity by increasing the number of players, market making by promoting new institutions, developing a smooth yield curve for government securities market, and innovating new products.

## **THE PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKING BOND MARKET**

Public sector undertaking bonds are medium-and long-term obligations issued by public sector undertakings.

PSU bonds issues is a phenomenon of the late 1980s when the central government stopped/reduced funding to PSUs through the general budget. PSUs float bonds in the primary market to raise funds. PSUs borrow funds from the market for their regular working capital or capital expenditure requirement by issuing bonds. The market for PSU bonds has grown substantially over the past decade. All PSU bonds have a bullet redemption and some of them are embedded with put or call options. Many of these are issued by infrastructure related companies such as railways and power companies, and their issue sizes vary widely from  $\text{\textsterling}10-1,000$  crore. PSU bonds have maturities ranging between five and ten years. They are issued in denominations of  $\bar{\tau}1,000$  each.

The majority of PSU bonds are privately placed with banks or large investors. In privately placed issues, rating is not mandatory while public issues are mandatorily rated by one or more of the four rating agencies in India. Historically, default rates of PSU bonds are negligible and PSUs are perceived as quasi-sovereign bodies. Usually, bonds issued by state-owned PSUs carry interest payment and principal payment guaranteed by the respective state government. Such guarantees are issued mainly to facilitate the fund raising programmes for various long gestation infrastructure projects.

PSUs are permitted to issue two types of bonds: tax-free and taxable bonds. Tax-free bonds are bonds for which the amount of interest is exempted from the investor's income. PSUs issue tax-free bonds or bonds with certain exemptions under the Income Tax Act with prior approval from the government through the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for raising funds for such projects. PSUs which have raised funds through the issue of tax-free bonds are central PSUs such as MTNL and NTPC, and state PSUs such as State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and State Financial Corporations (SFCs). The bonds issued by the State Financial Corporations are SLR eligible for cooperative banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). Interest on these bonds is calculated on actual/365 days basis. Tax deduction at source is applicable. In the pre-reforms period, that is, before 1991, the maximum interest rate on taxable bonds was stipulated at 14 per cent and maximum interest rate on tax-free bonds was fixed at 10 per cent. The ceiling of banks' investment in PSU bonds was 1.5 per cent of incremental deposits. With effect from August 1991, the ceiling on interest rate on PSU bonds was removed and subsequently some of the • Public sector undertaking bonds are medium- and long-term obligations issued by public sector undertakings. They are privately placed with banks or large investors.

PSUs floated bonds at an interest rate of 17 to 18 per cent. Later, ceiling on tax-free bonds was raised to 10.5 per cent. The ceiling of bank's investments in PSU bonds was also removed which enabled banks to invest freely in them..

Provident funds were initially allowed to invest 15 per cent of their incremental deposit in PSU bonds. Later, this limit was increased to 30 per cent.

The revised guidelines for the issue of PSU bonds were issued in October 1993. The guidelines indicate that the minimum maturity of tax-free bonds should be seven years whereas PSUs will have the freedom to fix the maturities of taxable bonds. The public issues shall be subject to guidelines issued by the SEBI.

PSUs are allowed to issue floating rate bonds, deep discount bonds, and a variety of other bonds. All new issues have to be listed on a stock exchange.

Investors in PSU bonds include banks, insurance companies, non-banking finance companies, provident funds, mutual funds, financial institutions, and individuals.

There has been a declining trend in the amount raised through the issue of tax-free bonds. Since 1991–92, taxable bonds have become popular as the ceiling on interest rate on taxable bonds was removed. PSU bonds which traditionally were floated in the public issue market were privately placed in the 1990s. The PSUs preferred the private placement route for the issue of bonds. They have not tapped the primary market from 1997–98 to 2008–09. As the secondary market in PSU bonds is not active, PSUs prefer the private placement route. Moreover, it is easier and cheaper to raise funds through this route. The PSUs continued to tap the private placement market for their capital requirements.

## **Secondary Market in PSU Bonds**

PSU bonds are generally issued and traded in the form of promissory notes or stock certificates. Promissory notes are transferable by endorsement and delivery while stock certificates are transferable by duly executed transfer deed and stamp duty is applicable unless specifically exempted.

Clearing and settlement is now in a registered form. PSU bonds require no transfer deed for registration of new ownership and therefore are exempt from stamp duty. However, contract notes for transactions of PSU bonds require a stamp duty at 0.01 per cent.

Repos are permitted if PSU bonds are in demat form. To improve the secondary market activity, the Union Budget for 1999–2000 abolished stamp duty on transfer of dematerialized instruments.

PSU bonds are traded on the WDM segment of the NSE and debt (F) segment of the BSE.

PSU bonds have low liquidity though it is higher than that of government-guaranteed bonds or state government securities. Most trades are done through brokers. Brokerage costs and bid offer spreads are lower in case of PSU bonds than in the case of state government and government-guaranteed bonds. Trading takes place in multiples of  $\bar{\tau}$ 5 lakh for state-run pension funds and other financial institutions, and in multiples of  $\bar{\tau}1,00,000$ for small trusts and retail investors. Daily trading volumes average  $\overline{\epsilon}5$  crore with a transaction size of  $\overline{\epsilon}2$  crore.

PSU bonds offered better yield in the early 1990s. Owing to this, other cash-rich PSUs, mutual funds, and commercial banks invested in these bonds. They were one of the most active instruments in the early 1990s. The tax-free bonds were the most popular as the market used 'tax stripping repo strategies' to arbitrage tax differentials. This market was highly misused in the Securities Scam of 1992 as it was through this market that the funds were diverted from the banking system. This market revived in 1993 when PSU bond issues were deregulated to a greater extent. This led to a significant increase in institutional activity in this segment.

The volume traded has no doubt increased since 2000–01 but the percentage share in the total volume traded has decreased. The level of activity is quite low as most of the PSU bonds are privately placed leading to a reduction in the floating stock. The volume of activity has not picked up at a faster pace as retail investors are not interested in trading and there is an absence of standard norms.

Standard norms and market practices should be laid down to bring about greater transparency and liquidity in this segment. A primary dealer system akin to government securities market can be introduced in the PSU bond market. This will enhance trading and liquidity in the secondary market which, in turn, will help in the growth of the PSU bond market.

# **THE GOVERNMENT SECURITIES MARKET**

### **Introduction**

The government needs enormous amount of money to perform the following main functions:

- Provision of public services such as law and order, justice, and national defence.
- Central banking and monetary regulation.

• Government security is a tradable instrument issued either by the central government or state governments.

- Regulating economic activity in the private sector.
- Creation and maintenance of physical infrastructure.

The government generates revenue in the form of taxes and income from ownership of assets. Besides these, it borrows extensively from banks, financial institutions, and the public, to finance its expenditure in excess of its revenues.

One of the important source of borrowing funds is the government securities market (GSM). The government raises short-term and long-term funds by issuing securities. These securities do not carry risk and are as good as gold as the government guarantees the payment of interest and the repayment of principal. They are, therefore, referred to as gilt-edged securities. The government securities market is the largest market in any economic system and therefore, is the benchmark for other markets.

### **Importance of the Government Securities Market (GSM)**

GSM constitutes the principal segment of the debt market. It not only provides resources to the government for meeting its short-term and long-term needs but also acts as a benchmark for pricing corporate papers of varying maturities. Development of the government securities market is a pre-requisite for the development of corporate bond market. It acts as a channel for integration of various segments of the domestic financial market and helps in establishing inter-linkages between the domestic and external financial markets.

The government securities issues are helpful in implementing the fiscal policy of the government. It is critical in bringing about an effective and reliable transmission channel for the use of indirect instruments of monetary control. The working of the two of the major techniques of monetary control—open market operations (OMOs) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)—are closely connected with the dynamics of this market.

Government securities provide the highest type of collateral for borrowing against their pledge. They have the highest degree of security of capital and the return on each security depends on the coupon rate and period of maturity. They are traded for both long-and short-term periods depending on the investment and liquidity preference of the investors. Switches between the short-dated and long-dated securities take place on the basis of difference in redemption yields.

# **Issuers, Investors, and Types of Government Securities**

Government securities are issued by the central government, state governments and semi-government authorities which also include local government authorities such as city corporations and municipalities.

The major investors in this market are the nationalized banks as they have to subscribe to these securities to meet their reserve requirements. The other investors are insurance companies, state governments, provident funds, individuals, corporates, non-banking finance companies, primary dealers, financial institutions, and, to a limited extent, foreign institutional investors and non-resident Indians (NRIs).

These investors can be classified into three segments:

- Wholesale market segment, namely institutional players such as banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, primary dealers, and mutual funds.
- Middle segment comprising corporates, provident funds, trusts, non-banking finance companies, and small cooperative banks with an average liquidity ranging from  $\overline{77}$  crore to  $\overline{725}$  crore.
- Retail segment consisting of less active investors such as individuals and non-institutional investors.

The insurance companies are the second largest investors in government securities as the Insurance Regulation and Development Authority of India (IRDA) has stipulated that 20 per cent of the assets of general insurance and pension business and 25 per cent of life insurance business should be invested in government securities.

The government securities market is mostly an institutional investors market as standard lots of trade are around  $\bar{\tau}$ 1 crore and 99 per cent of all trade is done through the subsidiary general ledger (SGL) account, which is a kind of depository account held by the RBI. Individuals cannot open SGL accounts. They have to open SGL-II accounts with a bank or a primary dealer provided they have a huge balance and agree to trade on an ongoing basis.

Government securities are of two types: treasury bills and government dated securities. The latter carry varying coupon rates and are of different maturities. Sometimes, the RBI converts maturing treasury bills into bonds thereby rolling over the government's debt.

• The government securities are referred to as SLR securities as they are eligible securities for maintenance of the SLR ratio by the banks.

#### **Significance of the Government Securities Market**

- Principal segment of the debt market
- Acts as a benchmark for pricing debt securities.
- Plays a crucial role in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
- Facilitates government borrowings at reasonable cost.
- Government dated securities are longterm securities and carry a fixed or floating interest rate.

• Government securities are available in a wide range of maturities from 91 days to as long as 30 years.

In the government securities market, trading is done over the telephone through brokers. The trade is then reported on the negotiated dealing system (NDS). Subsequently, the trade is cleared and settled on Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL).

The RBI has proposed a screen-based trading system in government securities. Like equities, market players will be able to buy or sell bonds through the order matching screen-based system. The order matching system will provide a new window for price discovery of bonds.

## **Government Securities Market in the Pre-1991 Period**

The RBI was established in 1935, after which it issued government securities on behalf of the government and sold them to various institutions and the public at large. In the 1930s, the government issued securities at interest rates as low as 2.5 per cent, as the cheap money policy was adopted. After independence, the RBI was nationalized; since then, it frames the monetary policy, structure of interest rates, and the programme of borrowing through government securities on instructions from the government.

The programme of borrowing was gradually stepped up in the 1950s to finance development projects in various sectors of the economy. The rates of interest on government securities were also gradually stepped up to enable resource mobilization. To facilitate this programme of higher borrowings, the RBI carried out open market operations which helped in creating a genuine market for government securities. The RBI appointed reputed firms of brokers and jobbers to carry out OMOs. Brokers were appointed for carrying out transactions between commercial banks. The traders in government securities were commercial banks, life insurance companies, general insurance companies, charitable and religious trusts, provident funds, and some individuals. There was daily trading in government securities either for longterm investment or for switching from long-term to short-term securities or vice-versa. Till the 1950s, government securities were more popular with individuals than with institutions.

Since the 1960s and until the 1990s, the government securities market remained dormant. The government was borrowing at pre-announced coupon rates from banks which were the predominant group of investors. To maintain the cost of borrowings at a low level, the coupon rates offered on government securities remained negative, in real terms, till about the mid-1980s. During the 1980s, the volumes of both long and short-term debt expanded considerably, especially the latter due to automatic accommodation through the issue of ad hoc T-bills. The RBI had little control over some of the essential facets of debt management such as volume and maturity structure of securities to be marketed and the term structure of interest rates. The maturity structure of market loans remained highly skewed in favour of a longer term of more than 15 years.

The government securities market was constrained mainly by the absence of a definite limit on the automatic monetization of the central government budget deficits and by relatively low coupon rates offered on government securities to investors. Thus, a passive internal debt management coupled with automatic monetization of budget deficit made the government securities market dormant and prevented it from being deep and vibrant.

Considering the significance of a vibrant government securities market and for activating an internal debt management policy, a number of measures were announced in the middle of 1991 to reform the government securities market.

## **Objectives of Reforms in the Government Securities Market**

Reforms were undertaken in the government securities market for the following reasons:

- Increase the operational autonomy of the RBI.
- Improve institutional infrastructure.
- Improve the breadth and depth of the markets by introducing a variety of new instruments and bring about improvements in the market micro-structure such as yield-based and price-based auctions, tap loans, pre-announcing notified amounts, re-issues of dated securities, announcing calendar of T-bills, and liquidity support to primary dealers.
- Enable sound legal and regulatory framework by amendment to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act and propose introduction of the Government Securities Act.
- Bring in technology-related improvements which include initiation of computerization of public debt offices (PDOs) of the RBI and of real time gross settlement system (RTGS).
- Improve transparency and introduce standardized codes for market practices for encouraging standardized accounting norms.

# **Some Policy Measures Undertaken in the 1990s**

Keeping the above objectives in view, reforms were undertaken to strengthen the primary and secondary segments of the government securities market. Policy measures were undertaken by the RBI to raise resources for the government in a cost-effective manner and to improve trading systems, clearing and settlement infrastructure, and liquidity in the secondary market. The auction system for the sale of medium-and long-term securities was introduced from June 3, 1992. Some innovative instruments such as conversion of auction T-bills into term securities, zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds, tap stocks and partly paid stock were introduced.

From April 28, 1992, 364-day T-bill auctions were introduced and 91-day T-bill auctions from January 8, 1993. On June 6, 1997, 14-day T-bills were introduced but they were discontinued from May 2001.

Auctions of repurchase agreements (repo) of dated government securities were introduced from December 1992.

To develop the market, the Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI) was set up in May 1994. It began its operations in June 1994.

The most notable policy development in the government securities market during 1994–95 was the delinking of the budget deficit from automatic monetization by initially limiting the creation of ad hoc T-bills and subsequently discontinuing them.

The NSE started trading in government securities from June 30, 1994.

As a move towards greater transparency, the transactions of government securities through SGL accounts have been made public by the Reserve Bank on a regular basis from September 1, 1994.

A delivery versus payment (DVP) system for transactions in government securities was introduced with effect from July 17, 1995. The DVP system synchronises the transfer of securities with cash payment thereby reducing the settlement risk in securities transactions and also preventing the diversion of funds in case of transactions routed through the SGL accounts. In 1999, the computer networking between RBI's SGL and NSDL was completed thus enabling electronic settlement for investors having depository accounts with the NSDL.

The RBI set up a strong regulatory system which required that every trade must settle with funds and delivery of securities. lOUs and netting were prohibited. Trade reporting of the negotiated deals was made compulsory at the WDM segment of NSE.

In May 1995, the government, for the first time, issued guidelines for non-government provident funds, superannuation funds, and gratuity funds to earmark 25 per cent of their total corpus for investment in central government securities.

A well-developed government securities market enables other segments of the debt market to develop. As a step towards this, the government went for diversification of instruments—introduction of floating rate bonds indexed to yield on 364-day T-bills. Moreover, it re-issued securities of two-year, three-year, five-year, and ten-year maturities at fixed coupon. Further, it permitted commercial banks to retail government securities with non-bank clients.

A scheme of ways and means advances (WMAs) was introduced effectively from April 1, 1997, to accommodate temporary mismatches between government receipts and payments. This scheme replaced the practice of automatic monetization of deficit.

For building up a viable institutional framework and to diversify investor base, the RBI appointed primary dealers (PDs) and satellite dealers to perform the role of market makers in government securities. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), with a ceiling of 30 per cent investment in debt instruments, have been permitted to invest in dated-government securities. This ceiling of 30 per cent was removed in October 2008. In order to facilitate custodial and depository services to FIIs in dated-government securities and T-bills, FII investments are now permitted through the SGL account of depositories, in addition to the SGL account of the designated banks, subject to certain conditions. The limit of FII investment in government securities is USD 5 billion.

A flexible approach to the market borrowing programme of the state governments was introduced whereby they were given the option to raise 5 to 35 per cent of their market borrowings in a flexible manner as regards timing, maturity, and rate of interest.

With a view to moderating the adverse impact of a large borrowing programme, the RBI accepts private placement of government stock and releases them to the market when interest rate expectations become favourable. After a gap of nearly seven years, the government issued a long-term paper with a maturity of 20 years in 1998–99.

To encourage retail participation in the primary market for dated government securities, an allocation of upto 5 per cent has been provided to retail investors on a non-competitive basis. Participation in the auction process on a 'non-competitive' basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate bodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by the Reserve Bank as also to the investors who do not maintain current account (CA) or subsidiary general ledger (SGL) account with the Reserve Bank. However, non-competitive bidding in T-Bills is available only to State Governments and other select entities and is not available to the cooperative banks.In the case of auction for Treasury Bills, there is no ceiling for non-competitive bids. Only one bid is allowed to be submitted by an investor either through a bank or primary dealer.

The uniform price auction format for auctions which was confined to the auction of 91-day treasury bills was extended to the auction of dated securities. The central government issued two floating rate bonds on the basis of uniform price auction on November 21 and December 5, 2001, on an experimental basis.

The trading entities have been allowed to sell government securities allotted to them in primary issues on the same day thus enabling sale, settlement, and transfer on the same day.

There were instances of gridlock in the DVP system due to a shortfall of funds on gross basis in the current account of one or more SGL holders. To take care of such unusual occurrences, a scheme of special fund facility was introduced with effect from October 3, 2000, to provide intra-day funds to SGL holders for facilitating settlement of securities transactions in case of gridlock. The scheme provides for automatic invocation by the SGL account holder of undrawn refinance/liquidity support from the RBI for facilitating smooth securities settlement. All transferable government of India dated securities and treasury bills are eligible for automatic invocation of special intra-day fund facility from the RBI.

Some significant steps for further development of the government securities market which the RBI has taken in 2001–02 are as follows:

- Enhancing fungibility and liquidity through consolidation by re-issuance of existing loans.
- Promoting retailing of government securities and introduction of floating rate bonds.
- Elongation of the maturity profile of outstanding issuance including issuance of bonds with a maturity of 25 years.
- Development of new benchmark government securities by consolidating new issuance in key maturities.
- Setting up of an electronic negotiated dealing system (NDS) and Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) for facilitating trading and settlement in government securities. The NDS (Phase I) was operationalized from February 15, 2002 and CCIL too commenced its operations for clearing and settling of transactions in government securities including repos.
- A proposal by the RBI to the government to replace the existing Public Debt Act, 1944 by the Government Securities Act to simplify the procedures for transactions in government securities, allow lien marking/pledging of securities as also electronic transfer in dematerialized form is under consideration of the government.
- The electronic funds transfer (EFT) and real time gross settlement (RTGS) system are being put in force by the RBI.
- A road map for developing separate trading for registered interest and principal of securities (STRIPS) was prepared, and put on the RBI's website for comments and suggestions from the market participants.
- The regulatory and supervisory framework for the primary dealers had been strengthened in line with international practices.
- An indicative advance calendar for issuance of dated securities for the first half of 2002–03 was announced in March 2002, to improve transparency in primary issuance of central government securities and to enable both institutional and retail investors to plan their investments.

The government also announced, on February 28, 2001 that comprehensive legislation will be introduced on securitization, and clarification will be issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to promote the issuance of STRIPS, zero coupon bonds, deep discount bonds, and the like.

Some major developments in government securities market in 2002–03 were as follows:

- Introduction of the system of publishing a calendar by the RBI that outlines the issue of dated government securities every half year. The calendar for the financial year of 2002–03 was issued in March 2003.
- Screen-based order-driven trading in government securities on the stock exchanges was introduced on January 16, 2003.
- CSGL account holders permitted to enter into repo transactions in government securities, effective from March 3, 2003.
- Guidelines for uniform accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions were issued by the RBI.

- Under the securities lending scheme, the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has been permitted to borrow required government securities from selected members.
- In accordance with the RBI policy of consolidation of government debt, the practice of re-issuances of existing government securities continued in 2002–03 also. Of the 31 securities issued during 2002–03, 19 were re-issues. This accounts for 59 per cent ( $\overline{374,000}$  crore of the gross amount of  $\bar{\mathcal{F}}$ 1,25,000 crore raised through dated government securities under the market borrowing programme of the central government).

Retail trading in government securities at select stock exchanges commenced in January 2003.

The countrywide anonymous, screen-based and order-driven trading in government securities was introduced in January 2003 on the NSE, the BSE and the OTCEI. Following the recommendations of the Working Group on screen-based trading in Government Securities, an anonymous, Screen-Based order matching trading system was incorporated on the negotiated dealing system (NDS) from August 11, 2004.

The RBI permitted market participants to sell government securities from April 2, 2004 against confirmed purchase contracts provided the previous purchase contracts were either guaranteed by the CCIL or have the RBI as the counterparty. This sale transaction was introduced to reduce the market risk of participants and facilitate rollover of repos. It was operationalized by switching over to the DVP III mode of settlement of government securities transactions under which securities are settled on a net basis.

In April 2005, listed corporates were allowed to undertake repos in government securities thereby giving them a new avenue to deploy funds. The RBI also allowed urban cooperative banks (UCBs) and listed companies having gilt accounts with banks to undertake repos, subject to eligibility criteria and safeguards. Corporates will need to open a constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) account with a bank to be able to undertake repo transactions.

The settlement of all outright secondary market transactions in government securities is on  $T+1$  basis since May 2005.

The Reserve Bank permitted sale of government securities allotted to successful bidders in primary issues on the day of allotment, with and between Constituents Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) account holders. It also permitted a buyer from an allottee in primary auction to resell the security.

The NDS-OM trading module was introduced on August 1, 2005 to provide NDS members with a more advanced and efficient trading platform in government securities.

In February 2006, the Reserve Bank permitted banks which fulfilled certain eligibility criteria to undertake primary dealer business departmentally. Banks and PDs were permitted to undertake intra-day short sale in central government dated securities subject to the same being covered by outright purchase in secondary market within the same trading day. This period was extended to five trading days in October 2006. Stand-alone PDs were permitted to diversify their activities in addition to existing business of government securities, subject to limits.

The NDS-OM members were permitted to enter into 'When Issued' transactions in central government securities that have been notified for issuance but not actually issued. The Government Securities Act, 2006 was passed by the Parliament in August 2006.

With effect from January 1, 2008, the cover transactions of short sales and when-issued can be undertaken outside NDS-OM, that is, through the telephone or through purchases in primary market. The sale leg of short sales continues to be undertaken on NDS-OM.

It is mandatory for NDS members, both bank and non-bank including primary dealers, to hold a current account and SGL account with the Reserve Bank for settlement of government security transactions. To facilitate phasing out of current accounts of non-banks and non-PD entities with the Reserve Bank, a new system of 'multi modal settlements' (MMS) in government securities market was introduced in June 2008. Under this system, settlement of the securities leg of government security transactions undertaken by the non-bank and non-PD NDS members will continue to take place in the SGL account maintained with the Reserve Bank, while the funds leg will settle through the fund accounts maintained by these entities with select commercial banks appointed as 'Designated Settlement Banks' (DSBs) by the CCIL. Three scheduled commercial banks-HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Citibank-have been appointed as the DSBs. From June 30, 2008 onwards, secondary market transactions in government securities undertaken by mutual funds are being settled only through the DSBs.

### **STRIPS in the Government Securities market**

Separate trading for registered interest and principal of securities (STRIPS) is a process of stripping a conventional coupon bearing security into a number of zero coupon securities which can be traded sepa• Separate trading for registered interest and principal of securities is a process of converting one underlying security into a number of zerocoupon securities.

**Box 10.2** Reforms in Government Securities Market—A Bird's Eye View

*Source:* Rakesh Mohan; 'A Decade of Reforms in the Government Securities Market and Agenda for the Future,' *www.rbi.org.in.*

rately. To illustrate, a 10-year government security can be stripped into a principal component and a set of 20 individual coupons/assuming half-yearly coupon payments. Each of these 21 stripped securities can be treated as zero coupon bonds which can be traded at varying yields. For example, When ₹100 of the 8.32 per cent GS 2023 is stripped, each cash flow of coupon( $\overline{z}4.16$  cach half-year) will become coupon STRIP

and the principal payment ( $\overline{100}$  at maturity) will become a principal STRIP. These cash flows are traded separately as independent securities in the secondary market.

The conversion of one underlying security into a number of zero coupon securities called STRIPS increases the breadth of the debt market and provides a continuous market which ultimately helps in improving liquidity. It also leads to the development of a market determined zero coupon yield curve. The creation of securities of varied maturities from a single security satisfies the needs of different investors who have diverse risk profiles and investment horizons. STRIPS are discounted instruments with no periodic interest payment and hence there would be no need for reinvestment of intermediate cash flows. This would be an attractive feature for retail/noninstitutional investors. STRIPS benefits not only investors, but also issuers. STRIPS allow the issuer to issue securities with long-term maturity for any amount. These long-term securities can be stripped to meet the market needs for short-term securities. Moreover, the supply of securities increases with stripping and this boosts secondary market activity. Further, banks can issue STRIPS against the securities held by them. Thus, STRIPS facilitates the management of the banks' asset-liability mismatches.

The RBI's policy of re-issuance of existing loans and alignment of coupon payment dates across loans facilitating creation of volumes in certain benchmark securities is creating an environment for STRIPS. The secondary market volumes have increased and the market has the requisite size to make STRIPS a success. The necessary provisions have been made to facilitate the introduction of STRIPS in the Government Securities Act which is to replace the existing Public Debt Act, 1944.

In April 2005, the RBI announced its plan to consolidate debt securities with the intention of providing better liquidity and price discovery in the market. This consolidation will combine different securities into a particular maturity profile thus resulting in few securities with large issue sizes, which will be traded more actively. For example, if there are 15 different securities available for trading in the market that matures in the year 2015, these could be consolidated into one lot of securities which could mature in 2015. This will encourage an active STRIPS market in government securities as the large issue size will allow the coupon component to be floated and traded separately.

Accordingly, a new security, namely the 6.01 per cent Government Stock 2028 was issued on August 7, 2003 and its coupon payment dates were aligned to March 25/September 25. PDs which meet certain laid down financial criteria, would be authorized to undertake stripping and reconstruction of securities. The Public Debt Office of the RBI would act as a registry of stripped bonds.

The salient features of the operational guidelines issued by the RBI are as follows:

- 1. Any entity, including individuals, holding government securities that are eligible for stripping/ reconstitution (as notified by RBI from time to time) can strip/reconstitute these securities. Stripping/reconstitution, however, is permitted only in the eligible government securities held in Subsidiary General Leger (SGL)/Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) accounts maintained at Public Debt Office, RBI, Mumbai. Hence, any participant desirous of stripping/reconstituting government securities must open and maintain a demat account (SGL account or a Gilt account with a constituent) and hold government securities in electronic form.
- 2. The process of stripping/reconstitution of government securities shall be carried out at Public Debt Office, in the PDO-NDS as a straight-through process without any manual intervention.
- 3. Holders of government securities shall place their requests for stripping/reconstitution with an authorized entity. Initially, all PDs would be eligible to authorize stripping/reconstitution requests.
- 4. Stripping/reconstitution may be done at the option of the holder at any time from the date of issuance of a government security till its maturity.
- 5. All dated government securities having coupon payment dates on January 2 and July 2, irrespective of the year of maturity shall be eligible for stripping/reconstitution.
- 6. The minimum amount of securities that needs to be submitted for stripping/reconstitution will be  $\overline{\tau}$ 1 crore (face value) and multiples thereof.
- 7. STRIPS will be reckoned as eligible government securities for SLR purposes and retain all the characteristics of government security. They will be eligible securities for market repo as well as repo under LAF of RBI but with appropriate haircut.
- 8. STRIPS, being zero coupon securities, trade at a discount and are redeemed at face value. To begin with, STRIPS will be tradable only in the OTC market and such trades in STRIPS need to be reported on NDS for clearing and settlement through CCIL.

The guidelines relating to STRIPS became effective from April 1, 2010.

# **Retailing of Government Securities**

### **Measures to Promote Retail Trading in Government Securities**

- Banks allowed to freely buy and sell securities.
- Exempted from TDS.
- Support to primary dealers.
- Dematerialization of securities.
- Setting up of mutual funds dealing exclusively in these securities.
- A non-competitive bidding facility
- Depositories allowed to open a second SGL account.
- Retail trading in stock exchanges.

### **Advantages of investing in Government securities**

- Offer maximum safety
- Can be held in book entry *i.e.*, dematerialized or scrip less form.
- Available in wide range of maturities.
- Can be sold easily in the secondary market.
- Can be used as collateral to borrow funds in the repo market.
- Simple, safe and efficient system of settlement.

The existence of a strong retail segment is a prerequisite for the development of the government securities market. Individuals can buy government securities from the RBI's public debt office during auctions. However, most investors are not familiar with the functioning of the government securities market and most of them perceive government securities as an instrument meant for institutional investors. Owing to this, the retail market of government securities did not develop. The RBI has made efforts to promote retailing of government securities.

Banks are allowed to freely buy and sell government securities on an outright basis at prevailing market prices. They retail government securities to non-bank clients without any restriction on the period between sale and purchase. Further, the interest income on government securities was exempted from the provision of tax deduction at source with effect from June 1997 to facilitate genuine trading in the secondary market. With no TDS, government securities become an attractive investment for those interested in avoiding TDS, such as senior citizens.

One of the major objectives of setting up the primary dealer system and satellite dealer system was to increase the distribution channels and encourage voluntary holding of government securities among a wider investor base. The RBI has extended to them a scheme for availing liquidity support and the facility of repos (as lenders) for increasing the retail network.

With a view to enabling dematerialization of securities of retail investors, the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (SHCIL) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) were allowed to open SGL accounts with the RBI. The RBI allowed NSDL and CDSL to open a second SGL account for depository participants who, in turn, can hold in custody, government securities on behalf of the ultimate investors. Retail investment in government securities has been made easy via demat accounts. The procedural hassles have been considerably reduced.

The RBI encouraged the setting up of mutual funds dealing exclusively in government securities, called gilt funds, with a view to creating a wider investor base for them. The RBI provides special liquidity support to the extent of 20 per cent of the investment in government dated securities. A primary dealer sells gilts with a minimum investment of  $\overline{*}25,000$  while gilt funds provide access to an individual investor with a low investment minimum of  $\overline{55,000}$ . The awareness about gilt funds is rising as they are offering good returns. PNB Gilts is using the Punjab National Bank branch network to popularize government securities with retail investors. It has tied up with NSDL to work around the problem of physical transfers and has also launched an advertising campaign to inform the public about the advantages of investing in government securities. At present there are 15 dedicated gilt funds eligible to draw liquidity support from the RBI.

In order to encourage retail participation, in particular by mid-segment investors such as urban cooperative banks (UCBs), non-banking financial companies, trusts, and others in the primary market of government dated securities, the RBI announced on December 7, 2001, a scheme of noncompetitive bidding facility. According to this scheme, retail investors would be allocated upto 5 per cent of the notified amount at the weighted rate that evolves in the case of competitive bidding. The scheme became operational on January 14, 2002, when an auction of a 15-year government stock was held.

Retail trading in stock exchanges, *viz*., national Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and over the counter exchanges of India (OTCEI) commenced from January 16, 2003. For this purpose, banks and financial institutions were permitted to open demat accounts with depository participants in addition to their SGL accounts. The minimum order size was kept low at  $\bar{\tau}1,000$  but trading through stock exchanges failed to activate retail participation.

A few banks and primary dealers have taken useful initiatives to promote retail investment in government securities by offering these securities for sale at retail outlets. However, not much has been achieved by these efforts. Banks have been reluctant to market government securities to retail investors apprehending the creation of an adverse impact on their own deposits. Moreover, not much headway has been made in retailing government stock by NSE, NSDL, and so on which were given the facility of a second SGL account.

It is the primary dealers who can effectively build awareness regarding the advantages of holding government securities. They should be given all infrastructure support to create a retail market for government securities. PDs and banks may also provide both sale and purchase facility to ensure that retail investors are assured of liquidity of such investments. Besides these, the stock exchange network and the gilt funds can be used to expand the retail segment of the government securities market.

# **Investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) in Government Securities**

The RBI has permitted foreign portfolio investors to invest in government securities and State Development Loans (SDL). The limits for investment are revised by the RBI on a quarterly basis.

#### **Limits for Investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors in Government Securities**

# **'When-issued' Market in Government Securities**

The Reserve Bank allowed short-selling of government securities in the secondary market. It permitted intra-day short-selling of government securities with a stipulation that such a sale would be covered by purchase of bonds from the secondary market on the same trading day. This measure is expected to enhance liquidity in the government securities market. In July 2006, scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers were allowed to cover their short positions in Central Government Securities within an extended period of five trading days and to deliver a shorted security by borrowing it through the repo market.

The RBI issued guidelines in May 2006 for the development of 'when-issued' market in government securities. 'When Issued' is a short form of 'when, as and if issued.' All 'when-issued' transactions are on an 'if' basis, to be settled if and when the actual security is issued. 'When-issued' market enables market participants to trade in government bonds ahead of sale of such securities in a primary auction. This enables market participants to hedge themselves against movement in prices after the auction and build a secondary market in the bonds. Moreover, it facilitates the distribution process for government securities by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue and allowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption. It also facilitates price discovery process by reducing uncertainties surrounding auctions. According to the guidelines, transactions in a security on a 'When Issued' basis shall be undertaken in the following manner:

- 1. 'When-issued' transactions can be undertaken in case of new securities as well as securities that are being reissued.
- 2. 'When issued' transactions would commence on the notification date and cease on the working day immediately preceding the date of issue.
- 3. All when-issued transactions for all trade dates will be contracted for settlement on the date of issue.
- 4. At the time of settlement on the date of issue, trades in the when-issued security can be netted off with trades in the existing security.
- 5. When issued transactions may be undertaken only on NDS-OM.
- 6. Any 'when-issued' trade must have a Primary Dealer as a counter-party (both counter-parties can be PDs). In other words, non-PDs cannot be both buyer and seller in a when issued transaction.
- 7. Only PDs can take a short position in the 'when-issued' market. Non-PD entities can sell the whenissued security only if they have a preceding purchase contract for equivalent or higher amount.
- 8. Open positions in the 'when-issued' market are subject to the following limits:
  - a. Non-PD entities—Long position, not exceeding 5 per cent of the notified amount. (only buy side for banks)
  - b. PDs—Long or Short Position, not exceeding 10 per cent of the notified amount. (both buy and sell for PDs)
- 9. In case a PD is unable to deliver securities to the buyer after the auction on the settlement (or issue) date, the transaction will be settled as per the default settlement mechanism of CCIL.
- 10. In the event of cancellation of the auction for whatever reason, all 'when-issued' trade will be deemed null and void ab-initio on grounds of force majeure.

With the opening up of 'when-issued' market, the security can be traded from the next day of the announcement of the auction with settlement, following the day of auction. The 'when-issued' market • When issued trading is trading of government securities between the time a new issue is announced and the time it is actually issued.

#### **When-issued Trading**

- A tool to hedge risk.
- Facilitates
- distribution process. • Facilitates price
- discovery.
- Enables PDs to bid and underwrite accordingly.
- Enhances liquidity in the government securities market.

allows PDs to get a better understanding of what amounts they need to underwrite in an auction. It also gives them a better idea of what would be the likely yields for the security, enabling them to bid accordingly. As only 5 per cent of the total notified amount can be acquired by a single entity, there is a likelihood for wider distribution of the stock. It allows market more time to absorb large issues without disruption and facilitates price discovery by reducing uncertainty surrounding auctions.

The trading in 'when issued' market commenced with the auction of central government securities in the calendar week August 1 to 8, 2006.

In the US, a vibrant 'when issued' market for bonds as well as equities exists.

The ad hoc treasury bills emerged as a popular mode of financing the central government's deficit in the mid-1950s. For the smooth conduct of the government's business, it was mutually agreed between the central government and the RBI that a minimum cash balance of  $\overline{50}$  crore on Fridays and  $\overline{54}$  crore on other days would be held by the central government. To adhere to this administrative arrangement, it was agreed that whenever the cash balances fell below  $\overline{50}$  crore, the RBI would automatically issue fresh ad hoc T-bills of an amount that would restore the balance to  $\overline{50}$  crore. This mechanism ensured an unlimited access to the RBI's resources. The ad hoc T-bills which were meant to be temporary, gained a permanent as well as a cumulative character. Indeed, it became an attractive source of financing government expenditure since it was available at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum since 1974.

The RBI's credit to government is a source of reserve money generation and any investment in central government's securities by the RBI results in monetization of government deficit. Monetized deficit is the increase in the net RBI credit to the central government which is the sum of increase in the RBI's holdings of the government of India's dated securities, treasury bills, rupee coins, and loans and advances from the RBI to the centre since April 1, 1997, adjusted for changes in the centre's cash balances with the RBI. The RBI was expected to compulsorily finance ad hocs. The increase in the central bank's credit to the government led to an increase in money supply and inflation. The RBI had no way of containing monetization of the budget deficit and effectively implementing its monetary policy. In order to restore the role of the monetary policy in the economy, the government entered into an agreement with the RBI to put an annual ceiling on the issue of treasury bills, to reduce that ceiling over time, and finally to eliminate ad hocs.

The process of elimination of ad hocs was designed in three stages:

- Through limits on creation of ad hoc T-bills which operated between 1994–95 and 1996–97.
- Through a transition period of two years which began on April 1, 1997, when ad hocs were eliminated, and the new system of ways and means was introduced. However, overdraft above ways and means was made permissible only beyond ten continuous working days; though at a cost.
- The full-fledged system of WMA has been operating effectively since April 1999.

## **What is Ways and Means Advances?**

- This scheme has been evolved to accommodate temporary mismatches in government receipts and payments.
- The limit for WMA and the rate of interest on WMA will be mutually agreed upon between the RBI and the government from time to time.
- Any withdrawals by the government from the RBI in excess of the limit of WMA would be permissible only for ten consecutive working days.
- When 75 per cent of WMA is utilized, the RBI would trigger fresh floatation of government securities.
- Consistent with the discontinuance of ad hoc T-bills, the system of 91-day tap T-bills was also discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997. The outstanding ad hoc and tap T-bills as on March 31, 1997, were funded into special securities without any specified maturity, at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum on April 1, 1997.
- With the discontinuance of ad hoc T-bills and tap T-bills and with the introduction of WMA, the concept of conventional budget deficit was no more relevant. Therefore, the practice of showing budgetary deficit was discontinued; the gross fiscal deposit (GFD) is now the key indicator of deficit. Gross fiscal deficit is the excess of total expenditure including loans, net of recoveries over revenue receipts (including external grants) and non-debt capital receipts.

WMA is not a source of financing budget deficit and is not included in the budget estimates. It is only a mechanism to cover day-to-day mismatches in receipts and payments of the government. It is charged at market related interest rate. Hence, the use of WMA may have to be periodically abandoned.

• Ways and Means Advances is a mechanism to accommodate temporary mismatches in government receipts and payments.

# **Advantages of WMA**

- It is expected that WMA will not put an undue pressure on money supply as it is not a source of financing deficit.
- It would reflect the perceptions of both the issuer (the government) and the investors since the entire market borrowing programme of the government is on an auction basis. This would lead to the deepening of the government securities market which, in turn, would facilitate the pricing of private corporate debt issues in relation to those of risk-free government paper.
- The introduction of WMA is a major step towards the achievement of greater discretion. The RBI has larger flexibility in the choice of its assets which, in turn, provide it larger expertise over management of liquidity in the system.

WMA also entails important obligations. If the central government is not in a position to address its fiscal deficit suitably and if this results in a disproportionate rise in market borrowing, the rate of interest on government paper will start rising, affecting the entire interest rate structure.

## **WMA Limits**

The RBI is required to set the limits of WMA for the Government of India. For the year 1997–98, the limit for WMA was fixed at  $\overline{\tau}12,000$  crore for the first half of the year (April–September) and  $\overline{\tau}8,000$  crore for the second half of the year (October–March). These limits were revised in the year 1998–99 and lowered to ₹11,000 crore and ₹7,000 crore respectively. Furthermore, the interest rates on WMA were delinked from the cut-off yield for 91-day treasury bills and linked to the bank rate. For 2001–02, the WMA limits were scaled down to  $\overline{0,000}$  crore during the first half of the year and  $\overline{0,000}$  crore during the second half of the year. When 75 per cent of the limit for WMA is utilized by the government, the RBI may trigger fresh floatation of market loans, depending on market conditions. The interest rate on WMA was the bank rate, and on overdrafts the interest rate was the bank rate plus two percentage points. The minimum balance required to be maintained by the Government of India with the RBI is not less than  $\overline{100}$  crore on Fridays, as at the close of the government's financial year and on June 30, and not less than  $\bar{\tau}10$  crore on other days. Overdrafts are limited to 10 consecutive working days.

The scheme of Ways and Means Advances (WMA) to the central government was **revised** on April 19, 2006 in consultation with the government. As per the revised arrangement, the WMA limits would be fixed on a quarterly basis instead of the existing half-yearly basis. The RBI retains the flexibility to revise the limits in consultation with the Government of India. The interest rates on WMA and overdraft are now linked to the repo rate as against the bank rate hither to. Accordingly, the interest rate on WMA are to be at the repo rate and that of an overdraft to be at repo rate plus two percentage points. The WMA limits were scaled up since 2010–11 on account of increase in expenditure of the central government. The limit for Ways and Means Advances (WMA) for the first half of the financial year 2017–18 (April 2017–September 2017) was at  $\text{\textsterling}60,000$  crore.

During 2008-09 and in the subsequent years, the government resorted to WMA for higher number of days to meet its expenditure needs and disbursement of fiscal stimulus packages announced by it to overcome the liquidity crisis.

# **Primary and Secondary Market Segments of the Government Securities Market**

### *Primary market of central government securities*

Debt instruments are issued in the primary market where initially they are subscribed to by the various investors who may or may not trade in them subsequently in the secondary market. The RBI issues government securities on behalf of the government.

The primary market operations of the RBI are mainly driven by the objectives of the debt management policy, which is to ensure funding of fiscal deficit from the market in a cost effective manner.

The primary market instruments are treasury bills and government dated securities. The central government mobilizes funds mainly through the issue of treasury bills and dated securities while state governments do so solely through dated securities.

**Treasury Bills** T-bills are short term obligations issued by the RBI on behalf of the Government of India through weekly and fortnightly auctions. Till 2000, there were 14-day T-bills, 91-day T-bills, 182-day Tbills, and 364-day T-bills. The 14-day and 182-day T-bills were discontinued from May 14, 2001. The 91-day auctions seek to manage the cash position of the government whose revenue collections are **Treasury Bills**

typically bunched towards the year end whereas revenue expenses are more evenly dispersed. Since April 1998, the practice of notifying amounts in case of all auctions including 364-day T-bills has been introduced. The RBI modifies the notified amounts keeping in view the temporary cash mismatch arising on account of certain government expenditure and prevailing liquidity conditions.

Arising on account of certain government expenditure the minimum denomination of 91-day T-bills is  $\text{\textsterling}25,000$  while that of 364-day T-bills is  $\text{\textsterling}1,00,000$ . The 91-day auctions occur every Wednesday and the 364-day on Wednesday preceding the reporting Fridays (fortnightly). Auctions are open to all resident individuals and corporates. Settlement for the auction occurs on the following Friday for both 91-day and 364-day T-bills. In 2001–02, the dates of payment for both 91-day T-bills, and 364-day treasury bills had been synchronized so that they could provide adequate fungible stock of treasury bills of varying maturity in the secondary market.

# **Government Dated Securities**

The Government of India securities are medium-to long-term obligations issued by the RBI on behalf of the government to finance the latter's deficit and public sector development programme.

Government securities are predominantly coupon-bearing and the coupon is paid semi-annually on a 30/360 days basis. However, there are floating rate or zero coupon securities also. No TDS is applicable. All government securities are SLR eligible. The central government securities are eligible for ready forward (repo) facility, whereas state loans are not eligible for repos. These securities are highly liquid.

### *Primary market issuance of government securities*

Government securities are issued either through auction, sale, or private placement with the RBI.

**Auction** Auction is a form of allocative mechanism whereby commodities and financial assets are allocated to individuals and firms, particularly in a market-oriented economy. The government's preference for the auction system for selling securities stems from the ability of auctions to reveal more information about price determination and improve the allocation process. Auctions are designed to generate higher volumes for meeting the target market requirement without recourse to underwriting and/or devolvement, broaden participation to ensure that bids are not concentrated or skewed, and ensure efficiency through lowering the cost of borrowing for the government. In June 1992, the government switched from the fixed price tender offer to the auction system for sale of government securities. The government, as a part of its annual budget exercise, announces the borrowing programme for the financial year. The RBI, acting in the capacity of merchant banker for the government's borrowing programme, raises money on behalf of the government by auctioning securities from time-to-time depending on the government's need for money, interest rates, and liquidity in the banking system.

The primary market for central government securities starts with an auction. A brief outline of the auction process is given as follows:

- The RBI announces the quantum, maturity, and date of the auction.
- On the day of the auction, all the participants submit their bid to the RBI. The bid includes the quantum and the yield at which they are bidding.
- The RBI decides the cut-off yield on the basis of the competitive bids it has received and its own view of the interest rates.

• Yield-based auctions are used for new issues and price-based auctions for reissue of existing securities.

- If the amount for which the bids are received falls short of the total quantum for which the auction is conducted, the RBI devolves the shortfall on itself or on the primary dealers (to the extent of their underwriting commitments).
- The cut-off yield becomes the coupon rate of that particular security.
- Lately, in order to promote liquidity in a particular security and to reduce the number of different government securities, the RBI has started issuing further tranches of existing securities in pricebased auction. Since the coupon rate and the maturity of the security are decided earlier, the bids are for the price. The auction procedure remains the same except that the bids higher than the cut-off price are accepted. Successful bidders are those that bid at a higher price, exhausting the accepted amount at the cut-off price. This multiple-price auctions are predominantly used in selling government securities. Since 1999–2000, most of the current primary issues of dated securities are through re-issues and price-based auctions, instead of yield-based auctions, to enable the consolidation of securities. Such consolidation is necessary for ensuring sufficient volumes and liquidity in any one issue, to facilitate emergence of benchmarks, and development of separately traded registered interest and principal of securities. The uniform price auction format for auctions, which was confined to the auction of 91-day treasury bills, was extended to the auction of dated securities in November 2001.
- The government auctions fixed rate, floating rate and inflation indexed bonds.

The government auctioned for the first time, on July 17, 2002, a bond with call and put features wherein the issuer can have the option to buy-back (call option) or the investor can have the option to sell the bond (put option) at par value at the time of any of the half-yearly coupon dates starting after completion of five years tenure from the date of issuance. The notified amount was  $\overline{*}3,000$  crore and the bond had a maturity of 10 years. On any coupon date on or after five years, the government can call the bond with two months' notice. The investor also has the right to put the bond on the same terms.

**Competitive and non-competitive bidding:** Government Securities are issued through bidding wherein the competitive bidders are primary dealers, financial institutions, mutual funds, and banks. The auction system was introduced in 1992 wherein the amount is notified but the coupon rate is auction determined. Since its inception, the multiple price auction method has been used. From 2001, both the multiple price and uniform price auction methods are in use.The uniform price method is used when there is market uncertainty and for issuing new instruments as well as bonds with long tenor.

*Non-competitive bidding:* The RBI introduced non-competitive bidding with a provision for allocation of upto 5 per cent of the notified amount in specified auctions of dated securities for allotment to retail investors on a non-competitive basis at the weighted average rate. The scheme was operationalized from January 14, 2002, with the auction of 15-year government stock. Noncompetitive bids are conducted to encourage participants who do not have sufficient expertise in bidding. The non-competitive bidders are state governments, municipalities, non-government provident funds, and other central banks.

## **Box 10.3** Government Securities Auction

The nomenclature of a typical dated fixed coupon Government security contains the following features (*i.e.*, coupon, name of the issuer, maturity and face value). For example, 10.70 per cent GS 2020 would mean:

| Coupon                       | : 10.70 per cent paid on face value          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Name of Issuer               | : Government of India                        |
| Date of Issue                | : April 22, 2000                             |
| Maturity                     | : April 22, 2020                             |
| Coupon Payment Dates         | : Half-yearly (October and April) every year |
| Minimum Amount of issue/sale | : ₹10,000                                    |

If the coupon payment date falls on a Sunday or a holiday, the coupon payment is made on the next working day. However, if the maturity date falls on a Sunday or a holiday, the redemption proceeds are paid on the previous working day itself.

• Multiple price auction is frequently used for primary issues of dated securities while the uniform price auctions method is used when there is market uncertainty and for issuing new instruments.

i. **Yield-Based Auction:** A yield-based auction is generally conducted when a new Government security is issued. Investors bid in yield terms up to two decimal places(for example, 8.19 per cent, 8.20 per cent, etc.). Bids are arranged in ascending order and the cut-off yield is arrived at the yield corresponding to the notified amount of the auction. The cut-off yield is taken as the coupon rate for the security. Successful bidders are those who have bid at or below the cut-off yield. Bids which are higher than the cut-off yield are rejected. An illustrative example of the yield-based auction is given below:

# **Yield-Based Auction of a New Security**

- Maturity Date: September8, 2018
- Coupon: It is determined in the auction (8.22 *per cent* as shown in the illustration as shown below).
- Auction date: September 5, 2008\*
- Notified Amount: ₹1000 crore
- \* September 6 and 7 being holidays, settlement is done on September 8, 2008, under T + 1 cycle.

The issuer would get the notified amount by accepting bids up to 5. Since the bid number 6 also is at the same yield, bid numbers 5 and 6 would get allotment pro-rata, so that the notified amount is not exceeded. In the above case, each would get ₹50 crore. Bid numbers 7 and 8 are rejected as the yields are higher than the cut-off yield.

ii. **Price-Based Auction:** A price-based auction is conducted when Government of India re-issues securities issued earlier. Bidders quote in terms of price per ₹100 of face value of the security (e.g., ₹102.00, ₹101.00, ₹100.00, ₹99.00, etc., per ₹100/-). Bids are arranged in descending order and the successful bidders are those who have bid at or above the cut-off price. Bids which are below the cut-off price are rejected. An illustrative example of price-based auction is given as follows:

# **Price-Based Auction of an Existing Security 8.24 per cent Gs 2018**

- Maturity Date: April 22, 2018
- Coupon: 8.24 *per cent*
- Auction date: September 5, 2008
- Auction settlement date: September 8, 2008\*
- Notified Amount: ₹1000 crore

\* September 6 and 7 being holidays, settlement is done on September 8, 2008, under T+1 cycle.

# **Details of Bids Received in the Decreasing Order of Bid Price**

The issuer would get the notified amount by accepting bids up to 5. Since the bid number 6 also is at the same price, bid numbers 5 and 6 would get allotment in proportion so that the notified amount is not exceeded. In the above case each would get ₹50 crore. Bid numbers 7 and 8 are rejected as the price quoted is less than the cut-off price.

Depending upon the method of allocation to successful bidders, auction could be classified as Uniform Price based and Multiple Price based. In a Uniform Price auction, all the successful bidders are required to pay for the allotted quantity of securities at the same rate, *i.e.*, at the auction cut-off rate, irrespective of the rate quoted by them. On the other hand, in a Multiple Price auction, the successful bidders are required to pay for the allotted quantity of securities at the respective price/yield at which they have bid. In the example under (ii) above, if the auction was Uniform Price based, all bidders would get allotment at the cut-off price, *i.e.*, `100.20. On the other hand, if the auction was Multiple Price based, each bidder would get the allotment at the price he/she has bid, *i.e.*, bidder 1 at ₹100.31, bidder 2 at ₹100.26, and so on.

Retail investors such as individuals, firms, companies, corporate bodies, urban cooperative banks, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by the RBI are allowed to participate in auctions as non-competitive bidders. These bidders are required to submit their bids through banks and PDs. Allocation for non-competitive bidding is within the notified amount and if the amount tendered by the non-competitive bidders is less than the reserved amount, all participants receive the full amount and the shortfall is transferred to a competitive position. If the amount received is more than the reserved amount, a pro-rata allotment is made to applicants. A non-competitive bidder is permitted to submit only one bid in the auction with a minimum amount of  $\bar{\tau}10,000$  and a maximum of  $\bar{\tau}2$  crore. Non-competitive bidders are issued securities at the weighted average price determined in competitive auctions.

There does not exist a fixed calendar for auctions of dated government securities. However, the auction of a dated security is announced in advance through a public notification. The securities are issued to successful bidders in the form of stock certificates or by credit to their SGL account.

**Sale** Earlier, the RBI used to adopt the sale route instead of auctions. Here, the coupon rate and maturity are predetermined and the securities are sold to investors at par. This approach was used predominantly for state loans upto 2005–06. Of late, some states have tried the auction method successfully. As part of its open market operations, the RBI often sells outstanding securities (devolved or privately placed with itself earlier) through its sale window at preannounced prices.

**Private Placement with the Reserve Bank** There are times when there is very tight liquidity in the banking system or when investors expect very high yields on the one hand and on the other, the RBI wants to keep the borrowing costs in check. Hence, it may not be possible for the RBI to hold an auction/sale. The RBI then places the securities with itself and funds the government. These securities are later sold in the market through its sale window at an opportune time. In this way, the RBI also signals its view on the interest rate.

#### *Market Borrowings, Ownership Pattern, Maturity Structure, and Interest Rates*

The developments in the government securities market are generally influenced by the central government's actual borrowing *vis-a-vis* the budgeted amounts, maturity, structure of the debt issued or
proposed to be issued, absorptive capacity of the market, and policies relating to domestic debt management. With a view to developing an active market for government securities, this market is being organized in such a way that the government reduces its dependence on credit from the RBI and other banks.

There has been an increase in the market borrowings of the central government. Since 1990–91, the borrowing programme of both the centre and the states handled by the RBI increased more than 50-fold from  $\text{\textsterling}11,000$  crore in 1990–91 to  $\text{\textsterling}6,000$  billion in 2016-17. The major reasons for this increase were as follows:

- A significant increase in repayment obligations arising out of high levels of domestic debt. For instance, in 1998–99, repayment liabilities of the central government absorbed 33 per cent of gross debts raised from the market as against only 16 per cent in 1991–92.
- The abolition of ad hoc and tap T-bills from 1996–97. These bills constituted a resource base for the government and with their discontinuance, the government had to borrow heavily from the market.
- The fiscal deficit exceeding the target by a wide margin. As a result, a large part of the fiscal deficit is financed through market borrowing. Since 2009–10, the central government financed nearly 90 per cent of its fiscal deficit through market borrowings as against 18 per cent in 1990–91. The revenue component of fiscal deficit is rising at a faster rate than the fiscal deficit itself. This means that the government is borrowing more for consumption rather than investment purposes.

Large government borrowings have an adverse effect on interest rate. The nominal interest rates rise on debt which make the debt market relatively more attractive than the equity market. Corporates find it difficult to raise funds through equity due to the depressed state of the equity market. This increases their debt–equity ratio and cost of borrowings which, in turn, affect the competitiveness of the private sector. Interest payments account for 35 per cent of government revenues. Large market borrowings when it is used to finance current expenditure, crowds out private investment, increases interest rate and imposes high debt burden on future generations. Thus, high level of government borrowings create a vicious circle.

In view of the large borrowing programme of the central government, the RBI has made efforts to soften the medium-and long-term interest rates on government securities either through direct devolvement or private placement combined with open market operations. In addition, since April 1999, the RBI has been reissuing the existing stocks through price-based auctions, thereby limiting the number of outstanding stocks. This passive consolidation strategy has been adopted due to the large market borrowings of the government. The RBI has also adopted the strategy of elongating the maturity profile of securities.

The Government announced net market borrowings for  $2017-18$  in the Union Budget at  $\overline{4}4,232$  billion  $(BE)$ , which included planned buyback of securities of  $\overline{5750}$  billion. The Union Budget has also provided for  $\overline{2}250$  billion for switching of securities, which is a debt management strategy that aims at reducing near-term redemption pressure and elongating the maturity of debt.

## **Ownership pattern of central and state government securities**

The subscribers to government securities are the RBI, commercial banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, provident funds, and others.

Notwithstanding various reform measures to develop and widen the primary market for government securities, the market continues to be dominated by captive investors such as commercial banks and insurance companies. Banks have traditionally been the dominant investors of the government securities due to SLR requirements. The investment of commercial banks constitutes, on an average, 35 per cent of the stock of government securities even though the SLR of the banks was significantly lowered to 23 per cent in 2013. Banks have found it advantageous to invest in government securities beyond the statutory requirements due to attractive market related interest rates offered since 1992–93, zero-risk nature of these securities, and depressed commercial credit market.

This narrow ownership base has a two-fold implications for the government. First, the large magnitude of borrowing puts pressure on the absorptive capacity of the market, particularly when the commercial banks hold excess government securities. Therefore, their choice regarding further subscription to government paper depends upon the attractiveness of return on other competing assets, particularly on loans and advances. When the industrial outlook improves and the demand for credit takes off, banks may not show their willingness to subscribe to government securities. Secondly, the concentration of the debt market in a few large investors introduces an element of rigidity in the downward adjustment of interest rate on government securities, particularly in the event of fulfilling the targeted market borrowing programme of the government.

The RBI's holding of government securities declined steeply in 1994–95 to 2.0 per cent from 20.3 per cent in 1990–91. This reflects that the government securities market has developed after reforms.

• Market borrowings of the central government increased substantially and had an adverse effect on interest rates. To curb an increase in interest rates, the central government needs to curtail its borrowing programme.

However, this trend reversed in 1997–98 with the surge in the RBI's holdings to 10.7 per cent as special securities in the bank's portfolio were converted to marketable lots with a view to facilitating open market operations. The RBI's holding of government securities increased to 14.6 per cent in 2016.

**The Reserve Bank's absorption of primary issues:** The RBI's absorption of primary issues came down drastically from 49.3 per cent in 1990–91 to 1.8 per cent in 1994–95. This was due to the higher absorptive capacity of the market. The RBI's subscription increased in the year 1998–99 due to the central government's recourse to gross market borrowings; and to contain the impact of high government borrowings, it privately placed the issues with itself. The monetary impact of the government borrowings was contained by offloading these securities in the market at a favourable time through open market operations.

The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 stipulates that the Reserve Bank cannot participate in the primary auctions of government securities from April 1, 2006. The Reserve Bank's subscription to primary issues substantially declined during 2004–05 and during the year 2005–06, gross issues of `10,000 were privately placed with the Reserve Bank at the end of the year. The RBI did not subscribe to primary issues of the central government since 2007–08.

**Maturity structure of central government dated securities outstanding:** With a move towards market related interest rates for meeting the borrowing requirements of the central government, there has been a significant shift in the maturity pattern of central government dated securities. A significant transformation in the maturity structure has been noted. The maturity structure of dated securities was highly skewed at the short end. The government's heavy dependence on short-to medium-term securities for the mobilization of market borrowing was due to uncertainty in market conditions and investor's preference for short-term maturities. Moreover, it was a conscious policy on the part of the government to minimise the cost of borrowing by placing a large part of the borrowings at the shorter end of the market. This maturity structure tilted towards short-term securities which led to significant higher gross borrowings to adhere to the repayment schedule. To avoid such high cost borrowings and redemption pressure entailing refinance risk, the government has avoided excessive maturities at the short end and the trend is towards issue of long-term securities since 1999–2000.

The low inflation rate and development of the government securities market helped in the successful elongation of maturity.

**Interest rates in the primary market:** The yield rates in the primary market refer to the interest cost at which the government borrows from the market. The interest rates in the primary market are influenced by the prevailing liquidity conditions, RBI's intervention by way of devolvement and private placement, and amount and frequency of issues during the year.

The weighted average interest rate of dated securities of the centre progressively rose from 11.41 per cent in 1990–91 to 13.75 per cent in 1995–96. The increased recourse to borrowing from the market and spells of tight liquidity put pressure on interest rates. Since 1996–97, the interest rates have declined; in the year 1999–2000, the interest rates were very close to the interest rates in 1991–92. Inspite of an increase in the market borrowing of the central government, the RBI was in a position to contain the interest rates. The RBI accepts the private placement of government stocks and releases them to the market when interest rate expectations become favourable. This policy of the RBI moderates the adverse impact of large borrowings by the central government. Moreover, liquidity conditions also softened in the money market which helped in containing the interest rates. The yields on primary issues of dated government securities eased during the year 2003–04. However, in the subsequent years there was a sharp increase in the weighted average interest rates of dated securities on account of hardening of interest rates and tight liquidity conditions. The weighted average yields have declined since 2015–16 and were 7.5 per cent in 2016–17.

**Yield curve:** The shape of the yield curve reflects the relationship among yields of securities that differ only with respect to their term of maturity. The curve depicts the various rates at which the same borrower is able to borrow for different periods of time. The most closely watched yield curve in any country is that of the government securities' which is the closest approximation of a risk-free yield. Other yield curves, such as the one for corporate borrowers, are best understood in comparison with the risk-free yield.

The yield curve is drawn against two axes: the vertical showing yield and the horizontal giving the term in years. The precise shape of the yield curve varies slightly from day-to-day and can change significantly from month to month. Normally, a yield curve is upward sloping which indicates a higher yield for longer maturity security. If long-term interest rates rise relative to short-term interest rates, the curve steepens. If short-term interest rates rise relative to long-term rates, the curve flattens.

- The largest investors in government securities are banks and insurance companies.
- The RBI's subscription to primary issues has substantially declined.

### **Box 10.4** Yield and Bond Prices

The price of a bond in the market is dependent on forces of demand and supply, economic conditions, general money market conditions, interest rates prevalent in the market, future interest rate expectations, and credit quality of the issuer.

Yields and bond prices are inversely related. When the interest rates in the market rise, the price of outstanding bonds will fall until the yield of these bonds is high enough to match the high interest rates on the new bond issues and the effect is vice versa when interest rates fall.

After a three-year period of positive returns on the notional one-year zero-coupon bond, negative returns were experienced in 2004 as the interest rates had gone up. An increase in interest rates leads to a fall in the bond prices which results in negative returns.

A number of studies confirm that the slope of the yield curve contains significant information about the future path of macro-economic variables in a number of countries. The yield curve is used to forecast short-term interest rates. When investors repeatedly purchase money market instruments rather than long-term instruments, and if a steeper yield curve emerges, it implies that they expect the money market yield to be higher in future than it is now. An inverted yield curve emerges when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates. Such a yield curve indicates that there is credit squeeze by the central bank. This credit squeeze is based on lower inflation expectation. Hence, investors in longer term instruments willingly accept lower nominal interest rates than one available on short-term instruments. This behaviour leads to an inverted yield curve.

Varying liquidity conditions and lack of adequate trading depth in the secondary market for government securities caused frequent shifts in the term structure of interest rates in the primary market.

The yield curve became inverted in 1993–94 due to spells of tight liquidity conditions. A downward shift was witnessed in 1994–95 but it shifted upward again in 1995–96 and 1996–97. Differences in the short and long-term inflationary expectations and temporary imbalances in the short-term money market and foreign exchange markets led to an inverted yield curve. The yield curve declined in 1997–98 and 1998–99 due to the RBI's policy of private placement to itself and a comfortable liquidity position in the money market. The yield curve of 2001–02 reflects a decline in both short and long-term yield rates. The yield curve flattened during 2003–04 as the long-term yields fell due to surplus liquidity. The yield curve shifted upwards during the year 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2011–12 with the increase in the interest rates across the maturity spectrum (Figure 10.1).

The yield curve started shifting downwards from 2015–16 onwards.

The low yields were a result of measures such as planned and predictable issuances, suitability of instruments as per investor preferences and improved transparency through timely and appropriate communication to the market.

## *Government dated securities—secondary market*

**Figure 10.1** Weighted Average Coupon Rates on Government of India Dated SecuritiesFigure 10.1 Secondary market in government securities can be categorized into two segments: the wholesale institutional segment and the retail segment.

- The wholesale institutional segment consists of active traders, mainly large banks, primary dealers, mutual funds, insurance companies, and others. The securities are traded in the SGL form and the market lot is  $\overline{5}$  crore. The secondary market for government securities is wholesale in nature, with most deals negotiated over the telephone. The trade is generally closed on the telephone which are then reported on the wholesale debt market segment of the NSE. Trade is then settled through the RBI which acts as a depositing-cum-clearing house.
- The retail segment includes cooperative banks, provident funds, non-banking finance companies, and others. The securities are traded in the SGL or physical form and the lots are odd, that is, less than  $\bar{\tau}1$  crore. Trades are settled directly by the counter-parties

and these trades may or may not be reported on the exchange. The high costs involved may not make it viable for the broker to report the transaction on the exchange.

With a view to promoting the retail market segment and providing greater liquidity to retail investors, banks were allowed to freely buy and sell government securities on an outright basis at prevailing market prices, without any restriction on the period between sale and purchase. Banks were permitted to undertake transactions in securities among themselves or with non-bank clients through the members of the OTCEI in addition to the NSE.

The interest income on government securities was exempted from the provisions of tax deduction at source with effect from June 1997 to facilitate quotations and trading in the secondary market. At present, the government securities market is predominantly institutional.

# **Trading of Government Securities in the Secondary Market**

The securities can be bought/sold in the secondary market either (i) Over the Counter (OTC), or (ii) through the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS), or (iii) the Negotiated Dealing System–Order Matching (NDS–OM).

### *i. Over the Counter (OTC)/Telephone Market*

In this market, a participant, who wants to buy or sell a government security, may contact a bank/Primary Dealer/financial institution either directly or through a broker registered with SEBI and negotiate for a certain amount of a particular security at a certain price. Such negotiations are usually done on telephone and a deal may be struck if both counterparties agree on the amount and rate. Transactions undertaken between market participants in the OTC/telephone market are expected to be mandatorily reported on the NDS platform within 15 minutes after the deal is put through over telephone.

#### *ii. Negotiated Dealing System*

The Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) for electronic dealing and reporting of transactions in government securities was introduced in February 2002. It facilitates the members to submit electronically, bids or applications for primary issuance of Government Securities when auctions are conducted. NDS also provides an interface to the Securities Settlement System (SSS) of the Public Debt Office, RBI, Mumbai thereby facilitating settlement of transactions in Government Securities (both outright and repos) conducted in the secondary market. Membership to the NDS is restricted to members holding SGL and/or Current Account with the RBI, Mumbai.

In August, 2005, RBI introduced an anonymous screen-based order matching module on NDS, called NDS–OM. This is an order driven electronic system, where the participants can trade anonymously by placing their orders on the system or accepting the orders already placed by other participants. NDS–OM is operated by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) on behalf of the RBI. Direct access to the NDS–OM system is currently available only to select financial institutions like Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers, Insurance Companies, Mutual Funds, etc. Other participants can access this system through their custodians, *i.e.*, with whom they maintain Gilt Accounts. The custodians place the orders on behalf of their customers like the urban co-operative banks. The advantages of NDS–OM are price transparency and better price discovery.

In the case of NDS–OM, participants place orders (price and quantity) on the system. Participants can modify/cancel their orders. Order could be a bid for purchase or offer for sale of securities. The system, in turn will match the orders based on price and time priority. That is, it matches bids and offers of the same prices with time priority. The NDS–OM system has separate screen for the Central Government, State Government and Treasury bill trading. In addition, there is a screen for odd lot trading for facilitating trading by small participants in smaller lots of less than  $\overline{5}$  crore (*i.e.*, the standard market lot). The NDS–OM platform is an anonymous platform wherein the participants will not know the counterparty to the trade. Once an order is matched, the deal ticket gets generated automatically and the trade details flow to the CCIL. Due to anonymity offered by the system, the pricing is not influenced by the participants' size and standing.

Gilt Account holders have been given indirect access to NDS through custodian institutions. A member (who has the direct access) can report on the NDS the transaction of a Gilt Account holder in government securities. Similarly, Gilt Account holders have also been given indirect access to NDS–OM through the custodians. However, currently two gilt account holders of the same custodian are not permitted to undertake repo transactions between themselves.

• The shape of the yield curve provides information about market expectations of future interest rates and inflation rates.

#### *iii. Stock Exchanges*

Facilities are also available for trading in Government securities on stock exchanges (NSE, BSE) which cater to the needs of retail investors.

# **Settlement of Government Securities**

#### *Primary Market*

Once the allotment process in the primary auction is finalized, the successful participants are informed about the amount that they need to pay to the Government on settlement day. The settlement cycle for dated security auction is T+1, whereas for that of Treasury bill auction is T+2. On the settlement date, the fund accounts of the participants are debited by their respective amounts paid and their securities accounts (SGL accounts) are credited with the amount of securities that they were allotted.

#### *Secondary Market*

The transactions relating to Government securities are settled through the member's securities/current accounts maintained with the RBI, with delivery of securities and payment of funds being done on a net basis. The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) guarantees settlement of trades on the settlement date by becoming a central counter-party to every trade through the process of novation, *i.e.*, it becomes seller to the buyer and buyer to the seller.

All outright secondary market transactions in Government Securities are settled on T+1 basis while in case of repo transactions in Government securities, the market participants will have the choice of settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis as per their requirement.

**Subsidiary general ledger account:** The RBI acts as a depository-cum-clearing house and settlement is through accounts maintained with the RBI called the subsidiary general ledger (SGL) accounts. The physical securities are dematerialized and the relevant holdings are in the form of book entries. Every participant in the government securities market maintains SGL and current accounts with the RBI. Those not eligible to maintain direct accounts with the RBI have the facility to open constituent SGL accounts or SGL II accounts with banks who have direct SGL accounts. The RBI has permitted the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited, banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, and primary dealers to offer constituent SGL account facility to an investor who is interested in participating in the government securities market. Any trade among participants are settled via this facility. The parties exchange the relevant SGL instruction receipts and the mode of transaction is delivery versus payment (DVP). The DVP system ensures settlement by synchronising the transfer of securities with cash payment. In the first phase, the RBI settled the payment of securities only on DVP-I basis where both funds and securities were settled on a gross basis. For all transactions undertaken directly between SGL participants, the settlement period was of T+0 or T+1 days while for transactions routed through brokers of the NSE, the BSE, or the OTCEI, the settlement period was upto T+5 days. Participants had the flexibility to decide the terms of settlement. Trades were settled by  $T+3$ , if desired by participants. This reduced settlement risks in securities transactions also prevented diversion of funds through SGL transactions.

The RBI launched the third phase of delivery versus payments (DVP III) on April 2, 2004. DVP-III is an enhancement to the DVP-II form of settlement, as it allows netting of transactions in government securities. DVP-III has boosted trading and improved liquidity in bonds market. This new system has come as a major relief to the market for repos. Earlier, participants could not sell bonds on the same day of the maturity of the repo contract as the RBI credited the securities account, called the SGL account, a day after the trade book place. Under DVP-III, participants are able to sell bonds the same day and protect themselves against price risk. DVP-III allows short sales of bonds to the extent that the securities should be contracted for purchase (but are not credited to the SGL account), provided such a purchase is guaranteed by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) or the RBI is a counterparty, to the deal. The settlement cycle of such a sale should be either the same as that of the purchase or a subsequent day, so that the delivery obligation under the sale contract is met by the bonds acquired under the purchase contract. The purchase leg of the transaction needs to precede the sell leg. If the securities are purchased on  $T+0$  basis (settlement on the same day), then it can be sold either on 'T+0 or 'T+1' (settlement a day later) basis. If it is bought on "T+1, it can be sold on "T+1" on the day of purchase or 'T+ $0'$ '/'T+1' on the next day. DVP-III has also enabled participants to roll over repo contracts, which are guaranteed by the CCIL. The security prices and interest rates on repos need to be renegotiated on the roll over.

- An SGL account is a securities account maintained by banks, primary dealers and financial institutions with the RBI.
- CSGL is a secondary gilt account opened with a bank or any other entity which maintains an SGL account with the RBI.

SGL accounts are maintained by the public debt office. The PDO oversees the settlement of transactions through SGL and enables the transfer of securities from one participant to another. The seller fills up the SGL form, the buyer countersigns it, and the seller sends this form to the RBI. The buyer transfers funds towards payment. Inter-bank government securities trades are settled on the same business day while trades with non-bank counterparties settle either on the same day or upto five business days after the trade date. Secondary market trades in government securities between banks are carried on upto 1.00 p.m. on business days and settled on the same day. Trades after that are settled the next day.

The transfer of government securities does not attract stamp duty or transfer fee. Moreover, there is no tax deduction at source on these securities.

Trade in the physical form is settled by the parties directly. Securities are delivered in the form of a physical certificate along with the transfer deed duly executed by the authorized signatures of the transferor. The transferee has to lodge the certificates with the RBI for transfer. The settlement cycle for secondary market government securities transactions has been standardized to T+1 with effect from May 11, 2005.

**Steps to develop the secondary market:** With financial sector reforms, efforts have been made to develop and widen the government securities market. Of late, the government has realised that a vibrant liquid secondary market fosters the growth of the primary market and hence the emphasis has shifted to the development of a liquid and broad based secondary market.

Subsidiary general ledger transactions were introduced to foster the growth of the secondary market by imparting a greater element of transparency. The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was allowed to participate in treasury bills and dated securities. The market infrastructure was strengthened by setting up of the Securities Trading Corporation of India in May 1994 to impart liquidity to government securities. The primary dealer system and the satellite dealer system were set up to strengthen the securities market infrastructure and to bring about an improvement in the secondary market trading, liquidity, and turnover.

The move to market related rates of interest has strengthened the development of the secondary market.

The RBI issued guidelines to banks for the retailing of government securities with non-bank clients on June 8, 1996. This move was a part of the measures to develop the secondary market in government securities and to make the market deep and broad based.

The RBI introduced the delivery versus payment mode of settlement for subsidiary general ledger transactions in government securities, electronic payment system to initiate balance inquiry and extended the MICR cheque clearing to non-metropolitan centres. It has been decided by the RBI to set up a very small aperture terminals (VSATs) which will not only provide reliable communication to the financial sector but would also improve the payments and clearing systems, facilitate funds transfer, and help in the building up of securities settlements on a centralized basis.

The RBI encouraged the setting up of mutual funds dealing exclusively in gilts for encouraging retail participation. These funds, known as gilt funds, exclusively invest in government securities and the RBI provides liquidity support to the extent of 20 per cent of their investment by way of reverse repos in central government securities outstanding at the end of the previous calendar month.

The RBI provides two-way quotes—buy and sell quotes—through its sale window to infuse liquidity in the secondary market for government securities. It offers two-way quotes on a select list of securities to improve liquidity. It continuously revises the sale/purchase prices and the list of securities.

• Delivery versus payment (DVP) is the mode of settlement wherein the transfer of securities and funds take place simultaneously.

Three types of DVP settlements:

- (i) DVP I The securities and funds legs of the transactions are settled on gross basis.
- (ii) DVP II The Securities are settled on gross basis whereas the funds are settled on a net basis.
- (iii) DVP III Both the securities and funds legs are settled on a net basis and only the final net position of all transactions undertaken by a participant is settled thereby reducing liquidity requirement.

### **Box 10.5** Trading in Government Securities

Government securities are traded on the clean price (trade price) but settled on the dirty price. (trade price + accrued interest).

Trade Value=Trade price x No. of government securities. Suppose 3,000 government securities are traded at  $\overline{\tau}101$  each, then trade  $value = 101 \times 3000 = ₹3,03,000.$ 

Settlement value = trade value + accrued interest.

Accrued interest = coupon of bond x face value x (no. of days from interest payment date to settlement date/360).

Retail trading in government securities is settled on a T+1 rolling settlement basis with effect from May 11, 2005.

• An outright transaction is one in which there is no intended reversal of the trade at the point of execution of the trade.

The RBI has planned to adopt the true real time gross settlement (RTGS) model system for government securities clearance and settlement. In RTGS, all transactions (claims or counter-claims) are settled immediately, that is, on a gross basis and this obviates the need for any clearing arrangement. However, participants under the RTGS system have to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the trading cycle to instantly honour every claim that is placed against them. The RBI has proposed to provide intra-day liquidity support to the participants to maintain minimum cash balances.

**Secondary market transactions in government securities:** The transactions in government securities have been made through the SGL since September 1994. The turnover consists of outright transactions as well as repos in eligible securities and treasury bills.

The steady growth in turnover and outright transactions reflects the increasing depth attained by the government securities market and the emergence of an active secondary market in government securities.

**Secondary Market Turnover in the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of NSE** The National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the NSE obtained permission from the RBI to open subsidiary general ledger accounts to offer constituent SGL facility to a wide range of investors. It has set up a common clearing and settlement framework for its SGL constituents to remove the counter-party risks. The majority of trades in government securities takes place through telephone but a large number of trades get routed through NSE brokers.

The trades in Government securities on the WDM segment of NSE have increased substantially. The share of the WDM segment in the total turnover of non-repo (outright) transactions have also increased. The transactions in dated securities account for a substantial share of transactions on the WDM segment. Banks and trading members are the dominant participants in WDM segment and WDM trades respectively.

# **Medium Term Debt Management Strategy**

A Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) was formulated by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the Government on December 31, 2015. The MTDS has been articulated for a period of three years (2015–16 to 2017–18). It is premised on three broad pillars: low costs, risk mitigation and market development in line with the sound international practices while factoring in domestic economic and financial conditions. The low cost objective is pursued through measures such as planned and predictable issuances, suitability of instruments as per investor preferences and improved transparency

through timely and appropriate communication to the market. The strategy adopted to contain rollover risks include switches/buybacks, elongation of maturity and placement of limits on issuances and annual maturities. Interest rate risks were dealt with by keeping the floating rate debt low; foreign currency risks were addressed by issuing debt in domestic currency, developing a stable domestic investor base and a calibrated opening of the g-secs market to foreign investors.

The Reserve Bank will continue to develop the government securities market by introducing new instruments, expanding the investor base and strengthening market infrastructure.

The borrowing programme of the central government is sought to be smoothly completed, while reducing costs and mitigating risks by adopting the following measures:

(i) Continuing the practice of front loading of market borrowings through dated securities.

- (ii) Switching of securities for effective liability management keeping in view the evolving market conditions.
- (iii) Pursuing the objective of elongating the maturity to contain rollover risks.
- (iv) MTDS articulated for three years will be reviewed and rolled over for the next three years (2016–17 to 2018–19).
- (v) Cash Coordination Committee (CCC) comprising members from the Government of India and the Reserve Bank will work towards better information sharing, cash flow forecasting and management.
- (vi) Features of the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme launched during 2015-16 will be improved upon for greater acceptability and expansion of the retail investor base.
- (vii) With the objective of enhancing liquidity and giving a retail push to the secondary market for government securities, a market making scheme will be formulated.
- (viii) The Reserve Bank will continue to make efforts towards market development, providing greater predictability and ease of access to the g-sec auction process by market participants.

# **Tools for Managing Liquidity in the Government Securities Market**

The RBI uses basically two tools to manage liquidity in the government securities market. These are: repos and open market operations. Repos have already been discussed in Chapter 4. The RBI manages short-term liquidity through repos and reverse repos and long-term liquidity through open market sales to absorb liquidity in conjunction with private placement/devolvement and open market purchases in tight liquidity conditions.

## *Open Market Operations*

Open market operation is an important tool of liquidity management. OMOs are actively used to neutralise excess liquidity in the system and to contain wide fluctuations in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets. It is an actively used technique of monetary control in developed countries such as the UK and USA. OMOs directly affect the availability and cost of credit. Its two objectives are: to influence the reserves of commercial banks, in order to control their power of credit creation and to affect the market rates of interest.

OMOs involve the sale or purchase of government securities by the central bank. When the RBI sells government securities in the market, it withdraws a part of the deposit resources of the banks, thereby reducing the resources available with the banks for lending. The bank's capacity to create credit, that is, give fresh loans, depends upon its surplus cash, *i.e.*, the amount of cash resources in excess of the statutory CRR stipulated by the RBI. The open market sale of securities reduces the surplus cash resources of banks as these resources are used to purchase government securities. Banks have to contract their credit supply to generate some cash resources to meet the CRR. The supply of bank credit which involves the creation of demand deposit falls and money supply contracts. The reverse happens when the RBI undertakes open market purchase of government securities. The open market purchase of securities leads to a reduction in the stock of securities of the seller bank and an expansion in the free surplus cash which augments the credit creation capacity of banks. The result is an expansion in the supply of bank credit and an increase in money supply.

OMOs do not alter the total stock of government securities but change the proportion of government securities held by the RBI and commercial and cooperative banks. Open market sales result in a fall in net RBI credit to government (NRCG) and an increase in the other banks' (co-operative and commercial) credit to government (OBCG) without affecting the budget (fiscal) deficit in anyway.

The RBI resorts to private placement when market conditions for government securities are not favourable and conducts open market sales later when liquidity conditions turn favourable. Thus, the RBI influences the resource position of banks, yields on government securities, and cost of bank credit through the open market sale and purchase of government securities.

• OMOs are a tool to manage liquidity in the system through sale or purchase of goverment securities by the RBI.

• Open market sale of securities reduces surplus cash resources of banks.

• Open market purchase of securities increases surplus cash resources of banks.

The RBI can buy or sell or hold government securities of all maturities without any restrictions. The bank purchased and sold government securities upto 1991–92 out of the surplus funds of IDBI, Exim Bank, NABARD, and other institutions under a special buy back arrangement. Till 1991–92, the market of OMOs was quite narrow as interest rates were administered and the government securities market was not broad based either. However, with the initiation of several measures to promote both primary and secondary markets in government securities, the OMO market has become active and OMOs have emerged as an important tool of debt management. Accordingly, various steps have been taken to alter the composition, maturity structure, and yield of government securities. The RBI also introduced the sale of securities from its own account on the basis of repo. Besides this, the bank offers for sale only a select number of securities which it wishes to undertake in response to market conditions, instead of maintaining a list including all dated securities in its portfolio. The RBI has also put on its purchase list a couple of securities for cash with a view to providing liquidity to at least a few securities.

In a move to augment the stock of marketable securities for active OMOs, special securities of value aggregating  $\text{\texttt{F15}}$ ,000 crore at 4.6 per cent were converted into marketable securities of 10-year, 7-year, and 8-year maturities at 13.05 per cent, 12.59 per cent, and 11.19 per cent on June 3, June 18, and August 12, 1997, respectively. The cost of additional interest on account of this conversion is fully borne by the RBI and is paid to the government as part of transfer of profits from year to year.

The RBI included treasury bills of varying maturities in the OMOs in 1998–99. The resort to OMOs epitomizes the move from direct to indirect instruments of monetary control.

OMOs have been successfully used by the RBI to groom or switch operations, *i.e.*, the sale of longterm scrips in exchange for short-term loans. This helps in lengthening the maturity structure of government securities which, in turn, becomes favourable for the working of the monetary policy.

The volume of RBI net sales (sales – purchase) increased over the years except in the year 1994–95 when tight money market conditions prevailed. Since 1996–97, OMOs have come into a sharper focus. The stock of marketable securities was augmented by conversion of special securities into marketable securities for conducting active OMOs. During 1996–97, outright sale of securities came into prominence to absorb excess liquidity which was due to large capital inflows and to maintain domestic interest rate and exchange rate at reasonable levels. The RBI did not purchase any security during 1998–99 through its OMO window. The open market sale rose significantly by 290 per cent in 1998–99. An important aspect in the OMO during 1998–99 was the inclusion of treasury bills of varying maturities. In 2000–01, due to uncertain foreign exchange market conditions and unfavourable market conditions for government securities, the RBI privately placed securities with itself. The securities were subsequently sold on-tap basis and through OMO auctions.

The RBI conducted a series of open market purchases aggregating  $\overline{55,084}$  crore during September 18–October 10, 2001, to support the government securities market in the face of the steep fall in the government securities prices due to adverse external developments after September 11, 2001. Subsequently, with stability in market conditions and easing of liquidity, it resorted to open market sales. These sales helped the RBI to absorb surplus liquidity on an enduring basis, stabilizing the prices of government securities, and offloading the securities privately placed with it. The RBI once again purchased government securities in 2008 and in the subsequent years to ease liquidity conditions in the market.

## **Infrastructure Development of the Government Securities Market**

The government securities market constitutes the principal segment of the debt market. The development of any market requires the strengthening of the market infrastructure with large number of market players who have divergent perceptions about the market and who would continuously provide liquidity. One of the initiatives taken to develop the government securities market during the first stage of the reform process was the setting up of Securities Trading Corporation of India. The STCI, together with Discount and Finance House of India, had the task of developing an active secondary market in government securities.

The RBI introduced the primary dealer system and satellite dealer system to further strengthen the market infrastructure.

#### *Primary Dealer System*

The primary dealer (PD) system was first introduced in the US in 1960. In the US, there are 25 primary dealers, most of which are banking or investment banking institutions. Other countries with a successful PD system include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and the UK. The obligations of PDs in these countries include participating in the primary market, serving as a

• Primary dealers act as market makers in the secondary market of government securities and participate in primary market auctions of government securities. market maker in the secondary market and providing market-related information to the central bank. Some advances countries such as Australia, Germany, and New Zealand have not yet established the PD system.

A system of primary dealers was introduced in India in 1996, to further strengthen the market infrastructure and to make it more liquid and broad based. The objectives of the introduction of this system were as follows.

- To strengthen the government securities infrastructure and facilitate government's market borrowing programme.
- To bring about improvements in the secondary market trading, liquidity and turnover in government securities.
- To encourage a voluntary holding of government securities amongst a wider investor base.
- To make PDs an effective conduit of OMOs.

The major focus of PDs would be on increasing the turnover of government securities rather than becoming a mere repository of this system. Hence, their role would be to act as market makers by providing two-way quotes in the secondary market, thereby ensuring liquidity and support to the primary market operation. In the long run, this system would facilitate the transfer of market-making activities from the RBI to PDs.

PDs can be subsidiaries of scheduled commercial banks, subsidiaries of all-India financial institutions, companies under Companies Act, 1956 engaged predominantly in government securities market, and subsidiaries of foreign banks/securities firms. Every PD has to maintain minimum net owned funds of `50 crore deployed daily in the government securities market. To ensure stability of PDs in times of volatile interest rates, the minimum capital requirement has been increased from  $\overline{50}$  crore to  $\overline{5150}$ crore. PDs which intend to diversify into other permissible activities need to have net owned funds of  $\overline{$}250$  crore as against  $\overline{$}100$  crore earlier.

Banks which do not have a partly or wholly owned subsidiary can undertake PD business if they fulfill the following eligibility criteria:

- 1. Minimum net owned funds (NOF) of  $\bar{\tau}1,000$  crore,
- 2. Minimum capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent and net NPAs of less than 3 per cent and a profit making record for the last three years.

They are also required to ensure that, at any point of time, there is a minimum balance of  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore of government securities earmarked for PD business. Bank-PDs will not have separate access to call money market and liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).

PDs as institutional entities fall in the category of non-banking finance companies. PDs are registered with and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, irrespective of whether they accept public deposits or not.

**Number of PDs** DFHI and STCI were accredited as primary dealers on March 1, 1996. On June 1, 1996, four more PDs—SBI gilts, PNB gilts, Gilts Securities Trading Corporation Limited, and ICICI Securities became operational. As on March 31, 2016, there were 21 approved PDs in the gilts market. Of these, seven were non-bank entities (stand alone PDs) and the remaining 14 were banks undertaking PD business departmentally(Bank PDs) registered as NBFCs under section 45 IA of the RBI act, 1934. The stand alone PDs are Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd, SBI DFHI Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., PNB Gilts Ltd., Morgan Stanley–PD, Nomura FI Sec. Ltd. and Goldman Sachs.

**Obligations Upon PDs** The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 stipulates that the Reserve Bank cannot participate in the primary auctions of government securities from April 1, 2006. Due to this, the responsibility of supporting government securities auctions has shifted to the primary dealers (PDs). PDs are expected to play an active role in the government securities market, both in its primary and secondary market segments. In order to enable PDs to perform their role effectively, the RBI has cast certain obligations upon PDs. The major roles and obligations of PDs are:

- 1. PDs are required to support primary market auctions for issue of Government dated securities and Treasury Bills as per the minimum norms for underwriting commitment, bidding commitment and success ratio as prescribed by RBI from time to time.
- 2. PDs should offer two-way prices (market making)in Government securities, through the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM), over-the-counter market and recognized Stock Exchanges in India and take principal positions in the secondary market for Government securities.

## **Facilities Extended to PDs**

- Provision of current account and SGL facilities with RBI.
- Access to LAF.
- Liquidity support facility.
- A scheme of underwriting and bidding commitments.
- Access to repo market
- Bank PDS are those which take up PD business departmentally as part of the bank itself.
- Stand-alone PDs are NBFCs that exclusively take up PD business and registered as NBFCs under section 45 IA of the RBI Act, 1934.
- From April 1, 2006 the responsibility of supporting government securities auctions has shifted to the primary dealers.
- 3. PDs should maintain adequate physical infrastructure and skilled manpower for efficient participation in primary issues, trading in the secondary market, and to advise and educate investors.
- 4. A Primary Dealer shall have an efficient internal control system for fair conduct of business, settlement of trades and maintenance of accounts.
- 5. A Primary Dealer will provide access to RBI to all records, books, information and documents as and when required.
- 6. PDs' investment in Government Securities and Treasury Bills on a daily basis should be at least equal to its net call/notice/repo (including CBLO) borrowing plus net RBI borrowing (through LAF/Intra-Day Liquidity/Liquidity Support) plus the minimum prescribed NOF.
- 7. PDs should annually achieve a minimum turnover ratio of 5 times for Government dated securities and 10 times for Treasury Bills of the average month-end stocks. The turnover ratio in respect of outright transactions should not be less than 3 times in government dated securities and 6 times in Treasury Bills (Turnover ratio is computed as the ratio of total purchase and sales during the year in the secondary market to average month-end stocks).
- 8. A PD should submit periodic returns as prescribed by RBI from time to time.
- 9. PDs' operations are subject to prudential and regulatory guidelines issued by RBI from time to time.

**Facilities Extended by the RBI to PDs** To strengthen this system and to make PDs fulfill their obligations, the RBI extends to them various facilities which include:

- 1. Access to Current Account facility and Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account facility (for Government securities) with RBI.
- 2. Permission to borrow and lend in the money market including call money market and to trade in all money market instruments.
- 3. Memberships of electronic dealing, trading and settlement systems (NDS platforms/INFINET/ RTGS/CCIL).
- 4. Access to the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) of RBI.
- 5. Access to liquidity support from RBI under a scheme separately notified for standalone PDs.
- 6. Favoured access to open market operations by Reserve Bank of India.

## **Sources and Application of Funds** Call/Notice Money Market

- 1. PDs are permitted to borrow funds from call/notice/term money market and repo (including CBLO) market.
- 2. PDs are allowed to borrow from call/notice market, on an average in a reporting fortnight, up to 225 per cent of their net owned funds (NOF) as at the end March of the preceding financial year.
- 3. PDs may lend up to 25 per cent of their NOF in call/notice market. The limit will be determined by PDs on an average basis during a 'reporting fortnight.'
- 4. These limits on borrowing and lending are subject to periodic review by Reserve Bank of India.

**Liquidity Support from the RBI** In addition to access to the RBI's Liquidity Adjustment Facility, stand alone PDs are also provided with liquidity support by the Reserve Bank of India against eligible Government securities including State Development Loans (SDLs). The parameters based on which liquidity support will be allocated are given below:

- 1. Of the total liquidity support, half of the amount will be divided equally among all the stand-alone PDs. The remaining half (*i.e.*, 50 per cent) will be divided in the ratio of 1:1 based on market performance in primary market and secondary market. Performance in primary market will be computed on the basis of bids accepted in the T-Bill auction and G-sec auction in the proportionate weights of 1 and 3. Similarly, the secondary market performance will be judged on the basis of outright turnover in T-Bills and dated Government securities in the proportionate weights of 1 and 3.
- 2. The PD-wise limit of liquidity support will be revised every half-year (April-September and October-March) based on the market performance of the PDs in the preceding six months.
- 3. The liquidity support to PDs will be made available at the 'Repo rate' announced by the Reserve Bank.
- 4. The liquidity support availed by a PD will be repayable within a period of 90 days. The penal rate of interest payable by PDs if liquidity support is repaid after 90 days is Bank rate plus 5 percentage points for the period beyond 90 days.

**Inter-Corporate Deposits** Inter-Corporate Deposits (ICD) may be raised by Primary Dealers sparingly and should not be used as a continuous source of funds. After proper and due consideration of the risks

Primary Dealers are now allowed to issue subordinated Tier II and Tier III bonds at coupon rates as decided by their Boards of Directors.

# *Role of Primary Dealers in the Primary Market*

Concomitant with the objectives of PD system, the PDs are expected to support the primary issues of dated securities of Central Government and State Government and Treasury Bills of Central Government, through underwriting/bidding commitments and success ratios. The related guidelines are as under:

## **Underwriting of Dated Government Securities**

### **Dated securities of central government**

- 1. The underwriting commitment on dated securities of Central Government will be divided into two parts (i) Minimum Underwriting Commitment (MUC) and (ii) Additional Competitive Underwriting (ACU).
- 2. The MUC of each PD will be computed to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the notified amount of each issue is mandatorily underwritten equally by all PDs. The share under MUC will be uniform for all PDs, irrespective of their capital or balance sheet size. The remaining portion of the notified amount will be underwritten through an Additional Competitive Underwriting (ACU) auction.
- 3. RBI will announce the MUC of each PD and the balance amount which will be underwritten under the ACU auction. In the ACU auction, each PD would be required to bid for an amount at least equal to its share of MUC. A PD cannot bid for more than 30 per cent of the notified amount in the ACU auction.
- 4. The auction could be either uniform price-based or multiple price-based depending upon the market conditions and other relevant factors, which will be announced before the underwriting auction for each issue.
- 5. Bids will be tendered by PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the underwriting commitment and underwriting commission rates. A PD can submit multiple bids for underwriting. Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, RBI will decide the cut-off rate of commission and inform the PDs.
- 6. Underwriting commission: All successful bidders in the ACU auction will be paid underwriting commission on the ACU segment as per the auction rules. Those PDs who succeed in the ACU for 4 per cent and above of the notified amount of the issue, will be paid commission on the MUC at the weighted average of all the accepted bids in the ACU. Others will get commission on the MUC at the weighted average rate of the three lowest bids in the ACU.
- 7. In the GOI securities auction, a PD should bid for an amount not less than their total underwriting obligation. If two or more issues are floated on the same day, the minimum bid amount will be applied to each issue separately.
- 8. Underwriting commission will be paid on the amount accepted for underwriting by the RBI, irrespective of the actual amount of devolvement, by credit to the current account of the respective PDs at the RBI, Fort, Mumbai, on the date of issue of security.

- 9. In case of devolvement, PDs would be allowed to set-off the accepted bids in the auction against their underwriting commitment accepted by the Reserve Bank. Devolvement of securities, if any, on PDs will take place on pro-rata basis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation of each PD after setting off the successful bids in the auction.
- 10. RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting up to 100 per cent of the notified amount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without assigning any reason.
- 11. An illustration pertaining to the underwriting procedure is given in Annexure III.

#### **Dated securities of state governments**

- 1. On announcement of an auction of dated securities of the State Governments for which auction is held, RBI may invite PDs to collectively bid to underwrite up to 100 per cent of the notified amount of State Development Loans (SDL).
- 2. A PD can bid to underwrite up to 30 per cent of the notified amount of the issue. If two or more issues are floated on the same day, the limit of 30 per cent is applied by taking the notified amounts separately.
- 3. Bids will be tendered by PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the underwriting commitments and underwriting commission rates. A PD can submit multiple bids for underwriting.
- 4. Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, the RBI will decide the cut-off rate of commission and the underwriting amount up to which bids would be accepted and inform the PDs.
- 5. RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting up to 100 per cent of the notified amount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without assigning any reason.
- 6. In case of devolvement, PDs would be allowed to set-off the accepted bids in the auction against their underwriting commitment accepted by the Reserve Bank. Devolvement of securities, if any, on PDs will take place on pro-rata basis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation of each PD after setting off the successful bids in the auction.
- 7. Underwriting commission will be paid on the amount accepted for underwriting by the RBI, irrespective of the actual amount of devolvement, by credit to the current account of the respective PDs at the RBI, Fort, Mumbai, on the date of issue of security.

#### **Bidding in Primary auctions of Treasury Bills**

- 1. Each PD will individually commit, at the beginning of the year, to submit bids for a fixed percentage of the notified amount of Treasury Bills in each auction.
- 2. The minimum bidding commitment amount/percentage for each PD will be determined by the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the PD. While finalizing the bidding commitments, the RBI will take into account the net owned funds (NOF), the offer made by the PD, its track record, and its past adherence to the prescribed success ratio. The amount/percentage of minimum bidding commitment so determined by the Reserve Bank will remain unchanged for the entire financial year or till the conclusion of agreement on bidding commitments for the next financial year, whichever is later.
- 3. In any auction of Treasury Bills, if a PD fails to submit the required minimum bid or submits a bid lower than its commitment, the Reserve Bank may take appropriate action against the PD.
- 4. A PD would be required to achieve a minimum success ratio of 40 per cent of bidding commitment for Treasury Bills auctions which will be monitored on a half yearly basis. A PD is required to achieve the minimum level of success ratio in each half year (April to September and October to March) separately.

Primary dealers can undertake 'When Issued' transactions in government securities, sale of securities allotted in primary issues on the same day and short sale in Central Government dated securities.

PDs are expected to play an active role in providing liquidity to the Government securities market and promote retailing. They are allowed to make full use of the facility to distribute Government securities to all categories of investors through the process of placing and picking-up orders on the exchanges. PDs may open demat accounts with a Depository Participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL in addition to their accounts with RBI. Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and demat accounts is enabled by PDO-Mumbai subject to guidelines issued by RBI's Department of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA).

# *Diversification of activities by stand-alone Primary Dealers*

Primary Dealers reported a loss of  $\overline{5700}$  crore during 2004–05 on account of an upturn in interest rates and yields. The Reserve Bank permitted PDs to diversify their activities in addition to their existing business of government securities from July 4, 2006 subject to certain conditions such as:

# **Stand-alone PDs:**

- IDBI Gilts
- ICICI Sec PD Ltd.
- PNB Gilts Ltd.
- SBI DFHI Ltd.
- STCI PD Ltd.
- Morgan Stanley Primary Dealer Pvt. Ltd.
- Nomura Fixed Income Securities Pvt. Ltd.

- 1. PDs, desirous of diversifying their activities should have a minimum net owned funds (NOF) of  $\overline{250}$  crore as against  $\overline{50}$  crore for a PD, which does not propose to diversify its activities.
- 2. The eligible PDs may bifurcate their operations into core activities and non-core activities. The core activities should involve dealing in government securities, interest rate derivatives, security receipts issued by securitization companies/reconstruction Companies, asset backed securities (ABS), mortgage backed securities (MBS) and other fixed income securities such as commercial papers and certificates of deposit, dealing and underwriting in corporate/PSU/FI bonds/debentures, lending in call/notice/term/repo/CBLO market and providing broking services in government securities .The non-core activities of PDs may include investment/trading in equity/units of equityoriented mutual funds/advisory services/merchant banking and other specified activities such as professional clearing services, distribution of mutual fund units, and distribution of insurance products. PDs are not allowed to undertake broking in equity, trading/broking in commodities, gold and foreign exchange. However, all PDs are required to ensure predominance of investment in government securities business by maintaining atleast 50 per cent of their total financial investments (both long-term and short-term) in government securities at any point of time.
- 3. The exposure to non-core activities shall be subject to risk allocation. PDs may calculate the capital charge for market risk on the stock positions/underlying stock positions/units of equity oriented mutual funds using Internal Models (VaR based) based on the prescribed Reserve Bank guidelines. The capital charge for market risk so calculated should not be more than 20 per cent of the NOF as per the last audited balancesheet.
- 4. PDs are not permitted to set-up step-down subsidiaries. PDs that already have step-down subsidiaries (in India and abroad) may restructure the ownership pattern of such subsidiaries. If the PD is a subsidiary of a holding company, the step-down subsidiary of the PD may become another direct subsidiary of the holding company. In case the PD itself is a holding company, then the step-down subsidiary may take up the PD activity and the holding entity may take up activities other than those permitted for PDs. The restructuring should be completed within a period of six months.

The Reserve Bank also gave primary dealers the option to merge with the bank which promoted them. These Bank PDs have to fulfill the eligibility criteria and are subject to all obligation applicable to stand-alone PDs. They have also to adhere to the following prudential norms:

- 1. The capital adequacy requirement for a bank will also apply to its PD business.
- 2. The government securities under PD business are reckoned for the SLR requirement.
- 3. The investment valuation guidelines as applicable to banks with regard to 'held for trading' portfolio are also applicable to the portfolio of government securities earmarked for PD business.

## *Investment Guidelines*

### **Investment in SLR securities (Government Securities)**

- 1. PDs should frame and implement investment and operational policy guidelines on securities transactions which should be approved by their Boards. While laying down these guidelines, the PDs should strictly adhere to Reserve Bank's instructions, issued from time to time. The effectiveness of the policy and operational guidelines should be periodically evaluated.
- 2. PDs should necessarily hold their investments in Government securities portfolio in SGL with RBI. They may also have a dematerialized account with depositories (NSDL/CDSL). All purchase/sale transactions in Government securities by PDs should be compulsorily through SGL/ CSGL/Demat accounts.
- 3. PDs should hold all other investments such as commercial papers, bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, and equity instruments, only in dematerialized form.
- 4. All problem exposures, which are not backed by any security or backed by security of doubtful value, should be fully provided for. Where a PD has filed suit against another party for recovery, such exposures should be evaluated and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors. Any claim against the PD should also be taken note of and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors.
- 5. The profit and loss account should reflect the problem exposures if any, and also the effect of valuation of portfolio, as per the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank, from time to time. The report of the statutory auditors should contain a certification to this effect.

**Investment in non-government securities** The RBI issued norms for investment by PDs in non-SLR debt in March 2004. These guidelines cover PDs' investments in non-government securities (including capital gains bonds, bonds eligible for priority sector status, bonds issued by Central or State public sector undertakings with or without Government guarantees and bonds issued by banks and financial companies) generally issued by corporates, banks, FIs and State and Central Government sponsored institutions, SPVs, etc. These guidelines will, however, not be applicable to (i) units of equity oriented mutual fund schemes where any part of the corpus can be invested in equity, (ii) venture capital funds, (iii) commercial paper, (iv) certificate of deposit, and (v) investments in equity shares. The guidelines will apply to investments both in the primary market and the secondary market. According to the norms,

- 1. The investment of PDs in unlisted non-SLR securities should not exceed 10 per cent of their portfolio. PDs' investment in paper issued by securitization and reconstruction companies and securitized debt in the nature of asset backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) will be included in the 10 per cent ceiling for unlisted debt.
- 2. PDs should not invest in non-SLR papers with an original maturity of less than one year, other than commercial paper and certificates of deposits. PDs are barred from investing in un-rated non-SLR bonds. The RBI has excluded investment in mutual fund schemes, which invest their entire corpus in debt securities from these norms for PDs. In addition, PDs are required to report their secondary market transactions in corporate bonds done in the OTC market on FIMMDA's reporting platform.

### *Supervision of PDs*

PDs have been brought under the purview of the BFS in 2002–03 in view of their growing systemic importance in terms of the following attributes : (a) their large number, (b) highly leveraged portfolios with short-term funds, (c) substantial share in the government securities market, and (d) a significant position in the money market, comparable with banks. The RBI also undertakes on-site inspection of each PD besides the off-site supervision through prescribed periodic returns.

The off-site surveillance of PDs is done on the basis of three basic returns—PDR I, II, and III. PDR I is daily statement of sources and uses of funds and is used to monitor the deployment of call borrowing and the RBI liquidity support, leverage, and duration of PDs portfolio. PDR I return has been revised to capture more details on sources such as ICDs and CPs. PDR II is a monthly statement on the basis of which bidding commitments, success ratio, underwriting performance, and secondary market turnover of PDs are monitored. PDR III is a quarterly return on the basis of which the capital adequacy of PDs is monitored. Apart from these regular returns, additional details are called for as and when necessary. The ALM guidelines for NBFCs with some modifications were also made applicable to PDs. A new quarterly return—PDR IV was introduced from the quarter ended March 31, 2004. PDR IV is a quarterly return on certain balance sheet and profit and loss indicators.

# **Trading of G-Sec on Stock Exchanges**

- 1. With a view to encouraging wider participation of all classes of investors, including retail, in G-Sec, trading in G-Sec through a nationwide, anonymous, order driven screen-based trading system on stock exchanges, in the same manner in which trading takes place in equities, has been permitted. Accordingly, trading of dated G-Sec in demat form is allowed on automated order driven system of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd., Mumbai (BSE), the Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) and the MCX Stock Exchange. This trading facility is in addition to the reporting/trading facility in the NDS. Being a parallel system, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corporations/clearing houses.
- 2. SPDs shall play an active role in providing liquidity to the G-Sec market and promote retailing. They shall, therefore, make full use of the facility to distribute G-Sec to all categories of investors through the process of placing and picking-up orders on the exchanges. SPDs may open demat accounts with a Depository Participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL in addition to their accounts with RBI. Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and own demat account is enabled by PDO-Mumbai subject to guidelines issued by Department of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA), RBI.
- 3. For trading of G-Sec on stock exchanges the following shall be adhered to by SPDs:
  - (i) SPDs shall take specific approval from their board to enable them to trade in the stock exchanges.
  - (ii) SPDs shall undertake transactions only on the basis of giving and taking delivery of securities.
  - (iii) Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process. All trades shall be settled either directly with clearing corporation/clearing house (in case they are clearing members) or else through clearing member custodians.
  - (iv) The trades done through any single broker shall also be subject to the current regulations on transactions done through brokers.
  - (v) A standardized settlement on T+1 basis of all outright secondary market transactions in G-Sec has been adopted to provide the participants more processing time for transactions and to help in better funds as well as risk management.
  - (vi) In the case of repo transactions in G-Sec, however, market participants will have the choice of settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis, as per their requirements.
  - (vii) Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/non-availability of clear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL transactions will be applicable. Stock exchanges will report such failures to the respective PDOs.
  - (viii) SPDs who are trading members of the stock exchanges may have to put up margins on behalf of their non-institutional client trades. Such margins are required to be collected from the respective clients. SPDs shall not pay up margins on behalf of their client trades and incur overnight credit exposure to their clients. So far as the intraday exposures on clients for margins are concerned, the SPDs shall be conscious of the underlying risks in such exposures.
  - (ix) SPDs, who intend to offer clearing/custodial services, shall take specific approval from SEBI in this regard. Similarly, SPDs who intend to take trading membership of the stock exchanges shall satisfy the criteria laid down by SEBI and the stock exchanges.

### *Primary Dealers Association of India*

PDs formed an autonomous, Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) in 1996. The role of PDAI is as follows:

- To promote a liquid debt market and set common standards for market participants.
- To achieve a harmonious integration of different segments of markets.
- To build a healthy relationship between different segments of market participants.
- To remove some legal, procedural, and administrative bottlenecks in the efficient functioning of the market.

Banks and PDs together formed another autonomous self-regulatory body, Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDAI), in 1997.

These two SROs have been proactive and are closely involved in contemporary issues relating to the development of the money market and government securities market. The credit for upgrading the technological infrastructure in these two markets goes to these two SROs. The representatives of the PDAI and FIMMDAI are members of the Technical Advisory Group on Money and Government Securities Markets of the Reserve Bank. The FIMMDAI has now taken over the responsibility of publishing the yield curve in the debt markets. The FIMMDAI prepared the guidelines for standard procedures and documentation to be followed by the participants in the commercial paper market and certificate of deposit market. Currently, the FIMMDAI is working towards the development of uniform documentation and accounting principles of the repo market.

**Operations of PDs** PDs bid substantially higher as against their bidding commitments in the primary market.

In the secondary market also, PDs achieved a higher turnover. In the secondary market, PDs individually achieve a minimum annual total turnover ratio (outright and repo transactions) of 5 times in dated government securities and 10 times in T-Bills. PDs also achieve the minimum annual outright turnover ratio of 3 times in dated G-Sec and 6 times in T-Bills. This reflects that PDs have made an effort to provide liquidity to the secondary market in government securities in their existence of twenty years. In a short span of time, PDs have sharpened their trading skills which has helped them in earning a greater return on assets. Besides this, factors such as a sharp decline in long-term interest rates, high liquidity, increase in investor preference for government securities, and thrust on the retailing of government securities have helped PDs in increasing the turnover in government securities.

The RBI, by way of a circular on July 26, 2002 made it mandatory for PDs to make public their performance accounts and results by way of newspaper advertisements.

The RBI divested its entire holdings in two PDs—Securities Trading Corporation of India and Discount and Finance House of India to avoid any potential conflict of interest generated by the ownership of regulated financial institutions.

Yields on government securities moved up by around 150 basis points during the year 2004–05. All PDs made losses as the soft interest rate regime ended. This resulted in low volumes, volatility in prices and low profitability. Moreover, PDs have to fulfill their bidding obligations and turnover requirements which has had an impact on their profitability. This led to a decline in the number of active PDs in the market, thus, limiting competition.

The RBI has proposed to provide exclusivity to PDs in primary issuances through the introduction of book building for government security issues. Introduction of book building will necessitate that every player subscribing to an issue goes through the PD, who will run the book for an issue of government securities. This will enable the PD to make an effective bid as he will be aware of the quantity and price at which the demand for the issue is coming in and also provide an alternative revenue streams for PDs. Moreover, business opportunities for primary dealers are expected to decline with the reduction in the fiscal deficit, hardening of government security yields and with electronic trading of securities and auctions. Hence, the RBI is considering proposal to permit primary dealers to invest in overseas sovereign bonds, and allow setting of joint ventures/wholly owned subsidiaries abroad to enable them to diversify their balance sheets.

PDs entirely rely on trading in government and corporate bonds to earn revenues. Recently, they have urged the RBI to allow them into other areas such as equities, interest rate futures, foreign exchange, and commodities to reduce their dependence on bonds to earn revenues.

## **Conclusion**

PDs have done a remarkable job in strengthening the government securities market infrastructure and improving the liquidity and turnover in the secondary market. PDs have emerged as dominant investors in the primary market issuances of government securities. The strengthening of the PD system enabled the RBI to successfully exit from the primary market with effect from April 1, 2006. However, there is still a long way to go for PDs. PDs together or their association, PDAI, should put in more efforts in the following areas for the healthy development of the government securities market:

- PDs or PDAI should take initiative in building awareness of government securities amongst individual investors so that a retail market for government securities is developed. Retailing of government securities is necessary to impart liquidity to the government securities market.
- One of the basic obligations of PDs is to offer two-way quotes in government securities, thereby providing continuous liquidity in the market. There is a need for greater transparency in the marketmaking function of PDs which, in turn, would impart credibility to PDs' operations. This will also help in retailing of government securities.
- PDs should continuously disseminate information to the RBI regarding market development. This would help the bank to know when to intervene in the market.
- PDs should strengthen their capital base to reduce their dependence on call money borrowings. This will automatically reduce any risk arising on account of market volatility.
- In Stage II of LAP, one-third of the liquidity support normally available to them at fixed rate of interest would then be available at market rates. This calls for a careful future business planning on part of PDs.
- PDs should adopt proper risk management practices to improve their returns.
- PDs should expand their branch network and spread their operations to other places to cater to the investment requirements of corporates and other large investors in government securities.

They need to be more proactive and business minded.

**Satellite Dealers** In order to widen the scope for organized dealing and distribution arrangement in the government securities market and to support the system of primary dealers, the RBI introduced a supporting infrastructure in the form of satellite dealers (SDs). SDs form the second tier of trading and distribution of government securities.

The guidelines for registration of satellite dealers in government securities market were announced on December 31, 1996. According to the guidelines, subsidiaries of scheduled commercial banks and all-India financial institutions (AIFIs), and companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 with minimum net owned funds of  $\text{\textsterling}5$  crore were eligible to be SDs. In pursuance of these guidelines, the RBI granted approval to 16 entities for registration as SDs in the government securities market.

SDs were permitted to issue commercial papers for raising resources and could avail of liquidity support from the RBI and the facility of ready forward transactions. Some of the satellite dealers were promoted as primary dealers.

The network of satellite dealers was created to promote the retailing of government securities but the performance of the satellite dealers was not found to be satisfactory. The RBI decided to discontinue the system after obtaining the view of the Primary Dealers Association of India. Accordingly, no new SDs will be licensed and existing SDs were required to make action plans satisfactory to the RBI for termination of their operations as SDs by May 31, 2002.

# **Measures to Strengthen the Government Securities Market Infrastructure**

For bringing about an improvement in trading and settlement in the money market and government securities market, the negotiated dealing system (NDS) and Clearing Corporation of India Limited have been set up.

#### *The Negotiated Dealing System*

The Reserve Bank introduced the NDS with a view to reforming the secondary market in government securities and money market operations, introducing transparency, and facilitating electronic bidding in auctions. Test runs on the NDS started in November 2001 and Phase I was operationalized from February 15, 2002, with 41 participants.

The NDS provides an online electronic bidding facility in the primary auctions of central/state government securities, OMOs/LAF auctions. It enables screen-based electronic dealing and reporting of transactions in money market instruments including repo, secondary market transactions in government securities, and dissemination of information on trades with the least time lags.

The NDS is integrated with the securities settlement system (SSS) of the Public Debt Office as also with the CCIL to facilitate paperless settlement of transactions in government securities and treasury bills and bring about improvement in services to investors in government securities. Once a trade is done/reported over NDS, it can be settled either through CCIL or directly through RBI-SGL. Settlement

- NDS provides an online electronic bidding facility in the primary auctions of government securities and an electronic dealing platform for trading in government securities.
- The goverment securities market now has deals being reported on a realtime basis.

through CCIL is on delivery versus payment (DVP-II) mechanism. DVP-II refers to settlement of securities on a gross basis (trade-by-trade basis) while funds will settle on a net basis.

Banks, PDs, and financial institutions having SGL accounts and current accounts with the RBI are eligible to participate in the NDS. It provides an electronic dealing platform for these participants in government securities. It enables the execution of deals in both the computer matching mode or a chat mode for negotiating deals on the system itself. Members are expected to report all the trades negotiated outside the system for settlement. It facilitates member participation in the primary auctions of government securities and treasury bills by submitting their bids/applications for auctions/floatation through their own terminals or pooled terminals. The pooled terminal facility is provided at all regional offices for use by SGL account holders not having member terminals. The NDS is used by the RBI for extending the liquidity adjustment facility to eligible members. All entities having SGL accounts with the RBI were advised to become members of the NDS by May 31, 2002. Till August 5, 2002, 138 SGL account holders were members of the NDS. On an average, 526 deals were reported daily on the NDS, of which 473 deals for  $\overline{3}11,688$  crore were ready for settlement during the quarter ended June 2002. These deals comprised money market deals (109 deals for  $\overline{8,762}$  crore), outright government securities trades (344 deals for  $\overline{2,080}$  crore) and repo transactions among member participants. The settlement of the government securities transactions through the CCIL constituted 91.3 per cent of the total government securities trades dealt/reported on the NDS.

The RBI plans to set up an electronic trading platform for repos in government securities which will function in addition to the existing voice-based system.

As the trading facilities—both negotiated and quote driven—were hardly used, a new platform was started on the NDS of the Reserve Bank—the NDS-OM (the NDS—Order Matching System) for trading in government securities on August 1, 2005. NDS-OM is an anonymous platform which allows sellers and buyers to interface by placing quotes. Transactions are executed by matching quotes. Initially banks and primary dealers were the only two participants allowed to trade using the new system. Mutual Funds which are NDS members and large pension/provident funds like the Central Board of Trustees/Seamens/Coal Miners' funds and insurance companies were later on permitted to access the NDS-OM market by opening temporary current/SGL accounts with the Reserve Bank. Primary dealers are executing trades on behalf of non-bank participants which will drive brokers out of business. The NDS-OM enables odd lot trading, trading of new securities in the when-issued market and trading of CSGL entities. It has become the preferred mode of trading in the government securities market accounting for 60 per cent of trading in this market.

The NDS has brought about significant improvements in secondary markets also. It has helped in increasing the level of transparency of the dealings in government securities, T-bills, and other instruments. The system has facilitated screen-based trading, provision of on-line trade information, and reporting through trade execution system for settlement, thereby improving market efficiency. It has also facilitated dissemination of price information on a real time basis to market participants, thus enabling them to execute trades effectively.

#### *Clearing Corporation of India Limited*

The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) was registered on April 30, 2001 under the Companies Act, 1956. The State Bank of India is the chief promoter of the CCIL. Its other promoters are banks, financial institutions, and PDs. It has been set up as an ordinary, limited liability, non-government company under the Companies Act, 1956 with an equity capital of  $\overline{50}$  crore. It functions like a business entity that is subject to corporate tax on its business profits.

It acts as the central counter-party in the settlement of all trades in government securities, treasury bills, money market instruments, repos, inter-bank foreign exchange deals, and derivatives of any kind where the underlying instrument is a security or money market instrument. The CCIL is the clearing and settling agency in respect of all trades by institutional players such as banks, DFIs, primary dealers, mutual funds, corporates, and NBFCs who account for more than 98 per cent of the total trades. It also supports through its fully owned subsidiary, ClearCorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd., three trading platforms in the forex and money market segments. It launched its forex dealing platform, FX-CLEAR on August 7, 2003 to meet the requirements of the inter-bank foreign exchange market in India. It developed an anonymous trading platform, NDS-OM in August 2005 to facilitate transparent and efficient trading in the government securities market. It launched an electronic screenbased quote driven dealing system-NDS-CALL on September 18, 2006 for call, notice, and term money operations.

After trade has been concluded on the negotiated dealing system (NDS), CCIL takes up the responsibility of settlement of trade via INFINET. During the settlement process, CCIL assumes certain risks, which may arise due to a default by a member to honour its obligations. For this, CCIL has designed the margining system and collects initial margin and mark to market (MTM) margin from members in respect of their outstanding trade. Initial margin covers the likely risk from future adverse movement of prices

#### **Clearing Corporation of India Limited**

- Acts as the central counter-party in settlement of all trades in securities and forex segment.
- Manages risks to avoid system failures
- Provides guarantee to non-SLR trades.
- Operates a settlement guarantee fund
- Manages the NDS-OM and NDS-CALL electronic trading platforms for trading in government securities and call money.
- Introduces innovative products/tools such as ZCYC, Bond and T-bill indices, and benchmarks reference rates.
- Introduced CBLO and FX-CIEAR.

of the securities while mark to market margin covers the notional loss (*i.e.*, the difference between the current market price and the contract price of the security covered by the trade) already incurred by any member. In addition, CCIL also collects volatility margin and operates a settlement guarantee fund (SGF) wherein each member contributes to it.

CCIL has put in place settlement arrangements on the Securities and Forex segments. In the securities segment, the settlement operation has been switched over to DVP III mode with netting of both funds and securities which has facilitated the rollover of repos. This has enabled participants to buy and sell securities on the same day subject to the stipulations of the Reserve Bank. It has also enabled members to reduce the risks from failed trades arising out of the defaults by their counterparties. By becoming central counter party to the trades done by its members, the CCIL absorbs risks.

CCIL acts as a central counter-party for forex trading also. Every eligible foreign exchange contract entered into between members, gets novated and is replaced by two new contracts—between CCIL and each of the two parties, respectively. The rupee leg is settled through the member's current account with the Reserve Bank and the US Dollar leg through CCIL's account with the designated settlement banks at New York. The settlement through CCIL has reduced the gross dollar requirement by more than 90 per cent.

The CCIL manages various risks such as credit and market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk to avoid serious system failures.

In securities transactions, the CCIL covers the credit and market risk by making members maintain initial margins as well as mark-to-market margins to cover future adverse movements of securities and notional loss respectively. Members are required to maintain adequate balances in the settlement guarantee fund (SGF) in the form of eligible government securities/treasury bills and cash (minimum 10 per cent) to cover the margin requirements in respect of their trades.

In foreign exchange transactions, the CCIL resorts to loss allocation mechanism to manage credit and market risk and restricts the membership to authorized dealers only.

To ensure liquidity for uninterrupted settlements, CCIL has arranged rupee securities through member contributions to the SGF, rupee funds through line of credit with various banks, and US dollar funds by way of a fully collateralized line of credit with the settlement bank. It has commenced settlement of forex forward trades with guarantee from the trade date from October 20, 2008.

To deal with operational risk, CCIL is developing a fully automated system for processing trades. A disaster recovery site is being set up at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, to ensure business continuity in case of a disaster.

The CCIL clears all transactions in government securities and repos reported on the NDS of the RBI and also rupee/USD free spot and forward deals. All repo transactions have to be necessarily put through the CCIL and all outright transactions upto  $\overline{z}20$  crore have to be settled through the CCIL. Government securities trades up to  $\overline{z}20$  crore have to be settled compulsorily through the CCIL. Since most transactions are of a value below  $\overline{z}20$  crore, more than 80 per cent of the government securities transactions are compulsorily routed through the CCIL. This move is aimed at protecting retail investors in the government securities market against counter-party risks and defaults and enable higher retail participation in the government securities market. For larger transactions, the market players have the option of settling transactions either through the CCIL or directly through the SGL account system of the RBI.

The RBI has asked banks to report all spot transactions in listed and unlisted non-SLR securities on the NDS and settle through the CCIL. This measure is expected to increase transparency in the non-SLR segment. The CCIL provides guarantee to non-SLR trades which will reduce default risks.

There were 153 active members in CCIL's securities clearing settlement as on March 31, 2009. The size of the guarantee fund was  $\overline{z}4,380.64$  crore. The CCIL's turnover in the government securities segment increased to  $\text{\textless}62,54,579$  crore in 2008–09 from  $\text{\textless}26,92,129$  crore in 2004–05. The CCIL cleared and settled an aggregate volume of  $\text{\textsterling}3,20,16,852$  crore in 2008–09 across its securities, forex, and CBLO segments. The caps placed by the RBI on call money borrowings by banks and PDs, the increased activity in the repo market and the general upswing in the securities market boosted the CCIL's turnover.

The CCIL proposes to launch a screen-based Repo Dealing System which would facilitate dealing in basket repos and special repos. Basket repo enables grouping of the underlying security into different baskets based on instrument category, liquidity and outstanding maturity profile. Special repo enables the borrowers/lenders to specify the security against which they want to borrow/lend. It is also developing a trading system and a system to undertake guaranteed settlement of trades in the IRS/FRA market.

The CCIL, which offers clearing and settlement facilities for inter-institutional government securities transactions and inter-bank foreign exchange transactions, has been recognized as a systemically important payment system (SIPS).

## **Impact of Reforms in the Government Securities Market**

- The operational autonomy of the RBI has increased through measures such as the abolition of automatic monetization through ad hoc T-bills and introduction of the system of WMAs for the central government.
- The introduction of a variety of new instruments such as floating rate bonds, capital indexed bonds, treasury bills of varying maturities, and others, and improvements in market micro-structures such as yield-based and price-based auctions, tap loans, preannounced notified amounts, noncompetitive bids outside notified amounts, re-issue of dated securities, announcing calendar of treasury bills, and the DVP system have added to the breadth and width of the government securities market.
- The institutional infrastructure of the government securities market has improved through the system of PDs.
- The government is borrowing from the market at market rates; this has led to greater market absorption and low devolvement on the RBI and PDs.
- Transparency has increased since the onset of reforms. The RBI has started publishing SGL data regularly. There has been an increase in reporting of deals in government securities on the NSE's WDM screen.
- The reforms have compelled the RBI to increase focus on treasury management and interest rate risk management.
- The auction system for raising funds has contributed to the development of bidding skills among the investors.
- The trading volumes have increased in the secondary market in government securities, reflecting the increasing depth attained by the government securities market. Moreover, the repo transactions have dominated the aggregate turnover which is again a reflection of the emergence of an active secondary market in government securities.
- The RBI has made efforts in the midst of the large borrowing programme of the central government to soften the medium and long-term interest rates on government securities either through direct devolvement or private placement combined with open market operations.
- Open market operations has emerged as an important tool for liquidity management together with repos to neutralize excess liquidity in the system and to contain wide fluctuations in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets.
- The settlement system has improved significantly. Safety of the settlement has been ensured through strict monitoring of the deals by banks and primary dealers and through the delivery versus payment mechanism.
- The consolidation of the government stocks by re-issuances of existing loans has imparted liquidity to the existing stocks and limited the number of floating stocks.
- Retail participation has been encouraged through the scheme of non-competitive bidding facility.
- The RBI introduced the NDS to enhance transparency in trading practices. The CCIL has been set up to significantly improve settlement systems and market efficiency and integrity. The NDS and the CCIL, have brought about a radical transformation in the government securities market which is similar to that which the NSE brought about in the equity markets.
- The government securities market has benefitted from the emergence of self-regulatory bodies, such as, the Primary Dealers Association of India and Fixed Income Money Markets and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA).
- In order to manage the maturity profile and reduce rollover risks of the government debt in a proactive manner, buybacks and switches are conducted by the RBI which has modulated redemption pressures and reduced the quantum of gross borrowing requirement.
- To cater to the demand from long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds, a 40 year security was also issued in 2015–16.

turnover, followed by the government securities market and then the equity market. The size of all the three segments has increased in the post reform period. One of the objectives of the reforms was to foster integration of various segments of the financial markets. The reforms have helped in linking the various segments but these linkages need to get widened and deepened to facilitate linkages with the global financial markets.

# **Conclusion**

The volume of activity in the debt market has increased significantly. The growth of the government securities market in the post-reforms period is noteworthy. The RBI has done a commendable job for the development of the government securities market. The sluggish equity market conditions have shifted the investors' preference towards debt. This has led to a growth in volume of trading not only in the government securities market but in the corporate debt market also. The entire debt market is witnessing an upsurge in trading volumes.

## **SUMMARY**

- 1. The debt market is one of the most critical components in the financial system of any economy and acts as the fulcrum of a modern financial system.
- 2. In the post-reforms era, a fairly well-segmented debt market has emerged comprising the private corporate debt market; the public sector undertakings bond market; and the government securities market.
- 3. The government securities market accounts for more than 90 per cent of the turnover in the debt market. It constitutes the principal segment of the debt market.
- 4. The RBI regulates the government securities market and money market while the corporate debt market comes under the purview of the Securities Exchange and Board of India (SEBI).
- 5. The major participants in the debt market are central and state governments, primary dealers, public sector undertakings, corporates, banks, mutual funds, foreign institutional, investors, provident funds, charitable institutions, and trusts.

- 6. With effect from October 31, 2001, banks, financial institutions, and primary dealers can make fresh investments in and hold bonds and debentures, privately placed or otherwise, only in demat form.
- 7. In the primary market, new debt issues are floated either through prospectus, rights, or private placement. The debt instruments are traded on the OTCEI, the BSE, and the WDM segment of the NSE.
- 8. Corporates adopt either the public offering route or the private placement route for issuing debentures/bonds. The corporate debt market constitutes a small segment of the debt market despite measures taken to promote this market during the 1990s.
- 9. Public sector undertaking bonds are medium-and long-term obligations issued by public sector undertakings. The majority of PSU bonds are privately placed with banks or large investors. PSUs are permitted to issue two types of bonds: tax-free and taxable bonds. PSUs are allowed to issue floating rate bonds, deep discount bonds, and a variety of other bonds. All new issues have to be listed on a stock exchange. The level of activity is quite low as most of the PSU bonds are privately placed leading to a reduction in the floating stock.
- 10. Government securities market not only provides resources to the government for meeting its short-and long-term needs but also acts as a benchmark for pricing corporate papers of varying maturities.
- 11. Government securities are issued by the central government, state governments and semi-government authorities which also include local government authorities such as city corporations and municipalities.
- 12. Considering the significance of a vibrant government securities market and for activating an internal debt management policy, a number of measures were announced in the middle of 1991 to reform the government securities market.
- 13. STRIPS is a process of stripping a conventional coupon bearing security into a number of zero coupon securities which can be traded separately.
- 14. The existence of a strong retail segment is a prerequisite for the development of the government securities market. The RBI has made efforts to promote retailing of government securities.
- 15. The system of ways and means advances (WMAs) has been evolved to accommodate temporary mismatches in government receipts and payments. WMA is not a source of financing budget deficit and is not included in the budget estimates. It is only a mechanism to cover day-to-day mismatches in receipts and payments of the government.
- 16. The Government of India securities are medium-to long-term obligations issued by the RBI on behalf of the government to finance the latter's deficit and public sector development programme. Government securities are issued either through auction, sale, or private placement with the RBI.
- 17. The RBI introduced non-competitive bidding with a provision for allocation of upto 5 per cent of the notified amount in specified auctions of dated securities for allotment to retail investors on a non-competitive basis at the weighted average rate.
- 18. Since 1990–91, the borrowing programme of both the centre and the states handled by the RBI increased more than 40-fold from  $\bar{5}11,000$  crore in 1990–91 to  $\bar{5}4.36$  lakh crore in 2008–09.
- 19. Notwithstanding various reform measures to develop and widen the primary market for government securities, the market continues to be dominated by captive investors such as commercial banks and insurance companies.
- 20. Secondary market in government securities can be categorized into two segments: the wholesale institutional segment and the retail segment.
- 21. The government securities can be held and transacted in two forms dematerialized SGL form and physical form. Registration of the participant with the public debt office of the RBI is mandatory in case of holding and trading securities in the physical form. The RBI acts as

a depository-cum-clearing house and settlement is through accounts maintained with the RBI called the Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) accounts. The physical securities are dematerialized and the relevant holdings are in the form of book entries. Every participant in the government securities market maintains SGL and current accounts with the RBI. SGL accounts are maintained by the public debt office. The transfer of government securities does not attract stamp duty or transfer fee. Moreover, there is no tax deduction at source on these securities.

- 22. The steady growth in turnover and outright transactions reflects the increasing depth attained by the government securities market and the emergence of an active secondary market in government securities.
- 23. The National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of NSE obtained permission from the RBI to open SGL accounts to offer constituent SGL facility to a wide range of investors. It has set up a common clearing and settlement framework for its SGL constituents to remove the counter-party risks.
- 24. Open market operation (OMO) is an important tool of liquidity management. OMOs are actively used to neutralize excess liquidity in the system and to contain wide fluctuations in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets. OMOs involve the sale or purchase of government securities by the central bank.
- 25. A system of primary dealers (PDs) was introduced in India in 1996 to further strengthen the market infrastructure and to make it more liquid and broad based. As on March 31, 2009, there were 19 approved PDs in the gilts market.
- 26. The NDS provides an online electronic bidding facility in the primary auctions of central/state government securities, OMOs/LAF auctions. It enables screen-based electronic dealing and reporting of transactions in money market instruments including repo, secondary market transactions in government securities, and dissemination of information on trades with the least time lags.
