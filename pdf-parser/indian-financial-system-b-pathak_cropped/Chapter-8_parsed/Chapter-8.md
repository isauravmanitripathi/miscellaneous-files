# **Introduction**

The secondary market is a market in which existing securities are resold or traded. This market is also known as the stock market. In India the secondary market consists of recognized stock exchanges operating under rules, by-laws and regulations duly approved by the government. These stock exchanges constitute an organized market where securities issued by the central and state governments, public bodies, and joint-stock companies are traded. A stock exchange is defined under Section 2(3) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, 'as any body of individuals whether incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or controlling the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities'.

# **Functions of the Secondary Market**

- To facilitate liquidity and marketability of the outstanding equity and debt instruments.
- To contribute to economic growth through allocation of funds to the most efficient channel through the process of disinvestment to reinvestment.
- To provide instant valuation of securities caused by changes in the internal environment (company-wide and industry-wide factors). Such valuation facilitates the measurement of the cost of capital and the rate of return of the economic entities at the micro level.
- To ensure a measure of safety and fair dealing to protect investors' interests.
- To induce companies to improve performance since the market price at the stock exchanges reflects the performance and this market price is readily available to investors.

# **Development of the Stock Market in India**

The origin of the stock market in India dates back to the end of the eighteenth century when longterm negotiable securities were first issued. The real beginning, however, occurred in the middle of the nineteenth century, after the enactment of the Companies Act in 1850 which introduced the feature of limited liability, and generated investor interest in corporate securities.

The Native Share and Stock Brokers' Association, now known as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) was formed in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1875. This was followed by the formation of association/exchanges in Ahmedabad in 1894, Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1908, and Madras (now Chennai) in 1937. In order to promote the orderly development of the stock market, the central government introduced a comprehensive legislation called the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.

The Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) was the largest stock exchange in India till the 1960s. In 1961, there were 1,203 listed companies across the various stock exchanges of the country. Of these, 576 were listed on the CSE and 297 on the BSE. However, during the later half of the 1960s, the relative importance of the CSE declined while that of the BSE increased sharply.

Table 8.1 shows the phenomenal growth in the operations of the stock markets in India till the nineties.

Till the early 1990s, the Indian secondary market comprised regional stock exchanges with the BSE heading the list. The Indian stock market was plagued with many limitations, such as the following:

### **Post-Reforms Market Scenario**

After the initiation of reforms in 1991, the Indian secondary market had a four-tier form as follows:

- Regional stock exchanges
- The National Stock Exchanges (BSE and NSE)
- The Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)
- The Inter-Connected Stock Exchange of India (ISE)

The NSE was set up in 1994. It was the first modern stock exchange to bring in new technology, new trading practices, new institutions and new products. The OTCEI was set up in 1992 as a stock exchange, providing small- and medium-sized companies the means to generate capital and It was based on the model of National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) of USA, with modifications to suit Indian conditions.

In all, there were 20 stock exchanges in India—15 regional stock exchanges, the BSE, the NSE, the OTCEI and the Interconnected Stock Exchange (ISE) of India. The ISE was a stock exchange of stock exchanges. The 15 regional stock exchanges located at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata, Cochin, Coimbatore, Delhi, Guwahati, Indore, Jaipur, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Chennai, Pune and Vadodara. They operated under the rules and by laws and regulations approved by the government and the SEBI.

At present, there are four stock exchanges, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India (MSEI) have been granted permission for carrying out trade in four segments—equity, equity derivatives, currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives. SEBI granted recognition to the India International Exchange (IFSC) Limited (India INX) for one year, commencing on the 29th day of December, 2016 and ending on the 28th day of December, 2017. Table 8.2 shows the secondary market structure in India.

## **Regulation of Stock Exchanges**

The stock markets in India are regulated by the central government under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which provides for the recognition of stock exchanges, supervision and control of recognized stock exchanges, regulation of contracts in securities, listing of securities, transfer of securities and many other related functions.

## **Organization, Management And Membership Of Stock Exchanges**

The organizational forms of the various recognized stock exchanges in India were as follows:

| (i) Bombay, Ahmedabad and Indore                                                  | Voluntary non-profit-making association of persons       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| (ii) Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Cochin,<br>Kanpur, Guwahati, Ludhiana and Chennai | Public limited company                                   |
| (iii) Coimbatore and Pune                                                         | Company limited by guarantee                             |
| (iv) The Over the Counter Exchange of India                                       | A company under Section 25 of the Companies<br>Act, 1956 |

The regional stock exchanges were managed by a governing body consisting of elected and nominated members. The trading members, who provide broking services, owned, controlled and managed the exchanges. The governing body was vested with wide-ranging powers to elect office-bearers, set up committees, admit and expel members, manage properties and finances of the exchange, resolve disputes and conduct day-to-day affairs of the exchange.

The OTCEI and the NSE are demutualized exchanges wherein the ownership and management of the exchange are separated from the right to trade on exchange. The National Stock Exchange was the only tax-paying company incorporated under the Companies Act and promoted by leading financial institutions and banks.

Brokers are members of the stock exchange. They enter trades either on their own account or on behalf of their clients. They are given a certificate of registration by the SEBI and they have to comply with the prescribed code of conduct. Over a period of time, many brokers with proprietary and partnership firms have converted themselves into corporate entities. Both NSE as well as OTCEI have laid down strict standards for the admission of members, which relate to capital adequacy, track record, education, experience and so on, to ensure quality broking services.

Brokers are important intermediaries in the stock markets as they bring buyers and sellers together, and aid in price discovery. There are three classes of brokers, namely, proprietary, partnership and corporate. In the old exchanges, most of the brokers are proprietary in nature, whereas in the new exchanges, they are corporate members. Several structural changes have taken place in the Indian broking industry over the past few years. Consolidation and reconstructuring have assumed considerable importance in this segment. As on March 31, 2010, there were 9,772 brokers and 4,424 brokers in the cash segment registered with the SEBI. The CSE has the highest number of brokers followed by the NSE, the OTCEI and the BSE.

A stock broker is required to pay an annual registration fee of  $\overline{5,000}$ , if his turnover per year does not exceed  $\bar{\tau}1$  crore. If it does, he has to pay  $\bar{\tau}5,000$  plus one-hundredth of 1 per cent of the turnover in excess of  $\bar{\tau}1$  crore. About 5 years from the date of initial registration, he has to pay  $\bar{\tau}5,000$  for a block of 5 financial years. The exchange also levies transaction charges.

The brokerage on transactions varies from broker to broker. The maximum brokerage that can be levied is 2.5 per cent of the contract price, exclusive of statutory levies such as SEBI-turnover fee, service tax and stamp duty. He is also required to pay the exchange, the transaction charges at the rate of 0.0035 per cent ( $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}$ 3.5 per  $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}$ 1 lakh) of the turnover. Trading members are also required to pay securitiestransaction tax (STT) on all delivery-based transaction, at the rate of 0.125 per cent (payable by both buyer as well as seller), and, in case of non-delivery transactions, at the rate of 0.025 per cent, for equities payable by the seller alone). Stamp duties are also payable by him as per the rates prescribed by the relevant states.

Brokers can now offer direct market-access (DMA) facility to institutional clients that allow clients a direct access to the exchange-trading system, through the broker's infrastructure, without any manual intervention by the broker. This enables brokers to have a direct control of clients over orders, faster execution of client orders, reduced risk of errors associated with manual-order entry, greater transparency, increased liquidity, lower-impact costs for large orders, better audit trails and better use of hedging and arbitrage opportunities through the use of decision-support tools/algorithms for trading.

Consolidation is taking place in the broking industry. Small brokerages are shutting shop as the big broking entities have cornered a big chunk of the broking business.

## **Demutualization of Stock Exchanges**

#### **Demutualization**

- Separation of ownership rights and trading rights.
- Stock exchange is a corporate tax paying entity.
- Safeguards the interest of investors
- Brings out greater transparency in the functioning of the stock exchanges.

All the stock exchanges in India, except the NSE and the OTCEI, were broker-owned and brokercontrolled. In other words, it was the brokers who traded, collectively owned and managed these exchanges. The ownership and managerial rights of the brokers often led to a conflict of interests, wherein the interest of brokers was preserved over those of the investors. Instances of price rigging, recurring payment crisis on stock exchanges and misuse of official position by office bearers, have been unearthed in the last few years. As a result, both rolling settlement as well as demutualization of stock exchanges were announced to preserve their integrity.

Demutualization is the process by which any member-owned organization can become a shareholderowned company. Such a company could either be listed on a stock exchange or be closely held by its shareholders.

Stock exchanges in India were either Section-25 companies under the Companies Act or an association of persons. Hence, stock exchanges were exempt from all taxes. The NSE, the OTCEI and the ICSE were set up as demutualized stock exchanges. The NSE was set up as a demutualized entity and is owned by financial institutions. Although the ISE was set up as demutualized, it was not a profit-making organization, which means that even if the profit gets generated, it cannot be distributed among owners, like in the NSE. Like the ISE, the OTCEI has been set up with a not-for-profit motive. It was the first demutualized exchange in the country, set up with a share capital of  $\bar{\tau}10$  crores and promoted by prominent Indian financial institutions. Table 8.3 provides a comparison of the NSE model and international models of demutualized exchanges.

Through demutualization, a stock exchange becomes a corporate entity, changing from a non-profitmaking company to a profit- and tax-paying company. Demutualization separates the ownership and control of stock exchanges from the trading rights of its members. This reduces the conflict of interest between the exchange and the brokers and the chances of brokers using the stock exchanges for personal gains. With demutualization, stock exchanges have access to more funds for investment in technology, mergers with and acquisition of other exchanges, and for strategic alliances with other exchanges. Members of the stock exchange also benefit by demutualization as their assets become liquid and they get a share of the profits made by the exchange through dividends. Demutualization makes operations of the stock exchange transparent, which facilitates better governance.

Demutualization process is similar to a company-going public—owners will be given equity shares. The exchange offers equity capital, either through dilution of existing promoters stake or by the fresh issue of capital. The process seeks to give majority control (51per cent) of the exchange to investors who do not have trading rights. This is to allow a better regulation of the exchange. Once listed as a public company, the exchange will be governed by the corporate-governance codes to ensure transparency.

There has been a global trend towards demutualization, wherein 17 stock exchanges including NAS-DAQ, and those of Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, London and Tokyo have already been demutualized, and another 15 are in the process of demutualization. The Amsterdam and Australian Stock Exchanges have become publicly listed companies. In Asia, the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) and the Singapore Monetary Exchange have merged.

In November 2002, SEBI approved the uniform model of corporatization and demutualization of stock exchanges, recommended by the Kania Committee. The committee recommended that stock exchanges in India, which were set up as associations of persons, should be converted into companies, limited by shares. The three stakeholders of the exchange—the shareholders, brokers and the investing public should equally represent the board. The trading and ownership rights, currently coded in the broker's membership card, should be separated. A broker will get trading rights after paying a certain fee, fixed by the exchange. The ownership right, however, will reside with the shareholders of the corporatized exchange. The shares of an exchange can also be listed on other exchanges.

The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act was amended on October 12, 2004, through an ordinance, making it compulsory for the exchanges to convert into corporate entities and delink their broker members from the

#### **Box 8.1** NASDAQ

The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) demutualized the NASDAQ stock exchange in the year 2000 by way of a twophase private placement ofsharesto dilute the stake of NASD in Nasdaq to 27 per cent. It raised a total of USD 516 million in the first phase and later raised another USD 240 million by offering convertible debentures in a private offering which could be converted to a 9.8 per cent stake in Nasdaq. Today, the exchange has over 2,900 investors.

So the question<br>of fiscal benefit prior to demutualization does<br>not arise.                                                                                          |
| Transfer of Assets                                                   | Assets were transferred from the mutual entity<br>to the for-profit demutualized company and<br>shares were given to the members in lieu of<br>the ownership in the old entity. There was no<br>cash consideration paid. Since an Initial Public<br>Offer (IPO) was also made in many cases, the<br>valuation of the shares were done by the market<br>and no separate valuation exercise was required<br>as for example in the case of the LSE where a<br>bonus issue was made. | The question of transfer of assets did not<br>arise because the NSE was set up by the<br>institutions as a demutualized company itself.                                                                                                             |
| Enactment of Legislation<br>to Give Effect to<br>Demutualization     | In several countries, a separate legislation was<br>necessary as in the case of Australia, Hong<br>Kong, Toronto and Singapore.

management. The ordinance restricts brokers' representation in the governing-body board of stock exchanges to 25 per cent. It also reduces their shareholding in the exchange to 49 per cent from the existing 100 per cent.

Moreover, 51 per cent of the stake of an exchange should be held by the public, other than shareholders having trading rights. Brokers' trading rights will be distinct from their ownership and management right in all exchanges. The segregation is expected to safeguard the interest of investors and bring about a greater transparency and efficiency of stock exchanges. The ordinance also allows inter-exchange trading among brokers, which would promote a trading platform for small- and mid-cap companies.

With corporatization, the assets owned by the exchanges become the personal property of the brokers. Brokers demanded a one-time exemption from all taxes, including capital-gain tax in respect of all the property of the exchange. The budget for 2003–04 announced an exemption from the payment of capitalgain tax for exchanges on corporatization.

In order to speed up the process of demutualization and corporatization of stock exchanges, the finance minister in the Finance Budget 2005–06, announced a one-time exemption from the stamp duty that is payable on transfer of assets.

The SEBI made it mandatory for stock exchanges to dilute 51 per cent ownership in favour of public. In India, three stock exchanges—the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange (ASE) and the Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange (MPSE), did not have a corporate structure as they functioned as associations of persons. They were first corporatized and then demutualized. The BSE completed the process of demutualization in June 2007.

All stock exchanges had completed their corporatization and demutualization process, and were functioning as for-profit companies, limited by shares, and at least 51 per cent of their equity-share capital is held by public other than shareholders having trading rights therein. Various investors like public-sector banks, public-sector insurance companies, public-sector undertakings (PSUs), industrial-development corporations, corporates and individuals had subscribed to the equity-share capital of the stock exchanges.

In view of the special nature of stock exchanges, the SEBI laid out norms in regard to the shareholding pattern, for recognized stock exchanges in respect of which the scheme for corporatization or demutualization has been approved by the Board under Section 4B of the Act.

- 1. The minimum stake of a single shareholder in a recognized stock exchange, directly or indirectly, cannot exceed 5 per cent of the total equity, and that at least 51 per cent of the total equity in such exchanges should be held by public. The holding limit of a single shareholder was enhanced to 15 per cent in respect of six categories of shareholders, which are public financial institutions, stock exchanges, depositories, clearing corporations, banks and insurance companies.
- 2. Any shareholder holding more than 1 per cent of the exchange's total equity cannot hike the stake, post-implementation of these norms.
- 3. No shareholder having trading rights in a recognized stock exchange shall, prior to issuance of the confirmation under Regulation 7, transfer his shares in such recognized stock exchange to any person otherwise than in accordance with Chapter II.
- 4. The private placement would be in line with the rules in the Companies Act.

These norms prevent any single entity from acquiring a substantial stake and, say, in the functioning of stock exchanges. Also, they enable foreign investors to acquire shares in stock exchanges and encourage competition among exchanges. The government has permitted 49 per cent (26 per cent by FDI and 23 per cent by FII) foreign investment in stock exchanges. Strategic investments in stock exchanges are required for the revival and growth of stock exchanges, so that they can compete globally. SGX and Deutsche Börse AG hold 5 per cent stake each in the BSE. In NSE, entities such as the NYSE Group, Goldman Sachs, General Atlantic and Softbank Asian Infrastructure Fund have a stake of 5 per cent each.

## **Policy on review of Ownership and Governance of Market Infrastructure Institutions**

A Committee was constituted to examine the issues arising from the ownership and governance of Market Infrastructure Institutions (Mlls). The committee has submitted its report. The Board considered the Report of the committee and other related matter and took the following major decisions:

#### *Networth and Ownership Norms for MIIs*

- 1. The Stock Exchanges will have minimum networth of  $\bar{\tau}$ 100 crore and the existing Stock Exchanges will be given 3 years to achieve this networth of  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore. The minimum networth for the Clearing Corporation (CC) and the Depository will be  $\bar{\tau}$  300 crore and  $\bar{\tau}$ 100 crore respectively. All existing clearing corporations shall be mandated to build up to the prescribed networth of  $\overline{\tau}300$ crore over a period of three years from the date of notification/circular.
- 2. i. The Stock Exchanges will have diversified ownership and no single investor will be allowed to hold more than 5 per cent except the Stock Exchange, Depository, Insurance Company, Banking Company or public financial institution which may hold upto 15 per cent.
  - ii. At least 51 per cent of the holding of the Stock Exchanges shall be held by public.
  - iii. In case of CCs at least 51 per cent holding will be held by Stock Exchanges. No Stock Exchange can hold more than 15 per cent in more than one CC. To ensure diversified ownership for shareholders other than Stock Exchanges, the limit of 5 per cent and 15 per cent shall apply as in the case of Stock Exchanges**.**
  - iv. In case of depositories minimum 51 per cent holding will be held by sponsors and the existing list of sponsors will continue. No other entity will be allowed to hold more than 5 per cent of equity share capital. Stock Exchange can hold upto 24 per cent.

v. The shareholding limits prescribed for each category of investors shall be inclusive of all instruments that provide for equity or rights over equity at any future date. The voting rights of no shareholder shall, however, exceed the prescribed maximum shareholding limit at any point in time.

#### *Governance Structure*

1. Autonomy of Regulatory Departments in MIl will be maintained in order to avoid conflicts of interest between regulatory and business functions of the MII—

#### **a. Member**

- i) The heads of departments of Member Regulation will directly report to an independent committee of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MD/CEO (dual reporting).
- ii) The long term goal would however be to set up an independent SRO at an appropriate time in future and provide the seed fund for the same.

#### **b. Listing Regulation**

- i) In Order to prevent a regulatory race to the bottom SEBI will prescribe the minimum listing standards to be followed by Exchanges.
- ii) The head of departments of Listing Regulation will cSrecr. report to an independent committee of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MO/CEO (dual reporting).

#### **c. Trading Regulation**

The surveillance function will report to an independent committee of the Board of the Exchange as well as to the MD/CEO.

All the independent committees will have a majority of Independent directors and will be headed by one of them.

 **d.** Besides the above a Conflict Resolution Committee (CRC) will be formed by SEBI with majority external and Independent members to deal with all issues concerning conflicts of interest. Issues of conflicts will be referred by Exchanges or may be taken up suo motu by CRC. The independent committee of Exchanges responsible for regulatory functions shall have regular interaction with CRC.

#### **e. Separation of Risk Management to Independent Clearing Corporation**

Among the functions of the Exchange it is the Clearing Corporation (CC) or Clearing House that fully bears the risk of payment and delivery by providing a guaranteed settlement of all transactions on the Exchange. It has therefore been decided, inter alia, that the central role of the clearing function will be separated into an independent corporation with its own prescribed networth:

- i. Clearing and settlement must compulsorily be carried out through a recognized clearing corporation under Regulation framed by SEBI.
- ii. To ensure effective supervision of CCs through regulations of SEBI.
- iii. CC will constitute a risk committee comprising independent members which shall report to the Board of the CC as well as directly to SEBI on issues and matters so identified and prescribed.
- iv. An expert committee will be set up by SEBI to examine the viability of introducing a single clearing corporation or interoperability between different CCs.
- 2. The Board of Stock Exchanges/CC. will not have any Trading Member/Clearing Member representative. However, an Advisory Committee shall be constituted by the Board of Stock Exchange/ CC, comprising of Trading Members/Clearing Members, to take benefit of experience of such Members. All recommendations of the Advisory Committee shall be placed in the ensuing Board meeting for consideration and appropriate decision. The Public Interest Directors representation on Board of Stock Exchange shall not be lesser than the number of shareholder directors and in case of recognized clearing corporation will be 2/3 of the Board strength.
- 3. Appointment of all Directors to the Board of Stock Exchanges/CC will be subject to approval by SEBI. Appointment of MD/CEO of Depository will also be subject to approval by SEBI.
- 4. The compensation structure for key management personnel are to be based on the principles of sound compensation practices issued by international fora like Financial Stability Board. The decisions in this regard are directed towards curbing incentives that result in excessive risk taking in the short term:

#### **Part One: Policies and Programmes**

- i. A compensation committee consisting of majority Public Interest Directors (PID) and chaired by a PID will determine the compensation of Key Management Personnel.
- ii. The variable pay component will not exceed one-third of total pay.
- iii. Of the variable pay 50 per cent of it will be paid on a deferred basis after three years
- iv. ESOPs and other equity linked options in the Mll will not form part of the compensation for the identified key management personnel.

- v. The compensation policy to key management personnel will be approved by SEBI. Also, the terms and conditions of the remuneration shall not be changed without the approval of SEBI.
- vi. The compensation policy may have 'claw back' arrangements.

#### **Profits of MIIs**

- 1. To bolster the risk management capacity of C.C. the stock exchange will be mandated to transfer 25 per cent of their profits to the Settlement Guarantee Fund of the CCs where their trades are settled.
- 2. In case of depository 25 per cent of the profits will be transferred to Investor Protection Fund of the depositories.
- 3. The non-core activities of Mlls will have to be segregated to a separate legal entity and when a related business of an Mll delivers a service to another Mll it will provide equal and fair access to all.

#### **Listing**

- 1. The stock exchanges may be permitted to list when they put in place the appropriate mechanisms for tackling conflicts of interest.
- 2. The stock exchanges will not be allowed to list on itself.
- 3. A recognized stock exchange shall be eligible for listing after three years of continuous trading operations immediately preceding the date of application of listing.
- 4. Depository may also be allowed to list but not the clearing corporation considering its risk bearing role.

## **Policy on Exit of Non-operational Stock Exchanges**

The following was decided by the board with regard to exit of stock exchanges which are non-operational or have been de-recognized:

- 1. The Board decided the process of de-recognition and exit of stock exchanges. A stock exchange without any trading at its own platform or where the annual trading is less than  $\bar{\tau}$  1,000 crore may apply for voluntary de-recognition and exit. If the stock exchange eligible for voluntary de-recognition is not able to achieve a turnover of  $\bar{\tau}$  1,000 crore on continuous basis or does not apply for voluntary de-recognition and exit within a period of two years from the date of notification, SEBI shall proceed with the compulsory de-recognition and exit of such stock exchange.
- 2. With regard to exit option to shareholders of exclusively listed companies, a mechanism of dissemination board at stock exchange is decided on the lines of bulletin board.
- 3. With regard to treatment of assets of the de-recognized stock exchanges, the Board decided that the stock exchanges may be permitted to exit subject to certain conditions such as payment of statutory dues to Government/SEBI contribution of certain percentage of assets of the exchange towards Investor Protection and Education Fund etc.
- 4. The trading members of the de-recognized stock exchange will continue to avail trading opportunity through its existing subsidiary company, which will function as a normal broking entity, at the Exchanges having nationwide trading terminals.

As on March 31, 2016, 17 regional stock exchanges had been granted exit by SEBI. Exclusively listed companies at Regional Stock Exchanges (RSEs), which failed to obtain a listing on any other stock exchange, had to be listed companies and moved to the dissemination board by the exiting stock exchange. The exiting stock exchanges were required to enter into an agreement with at least one of the stock exchanges with nationwide trading terminals providing a dissemination board. In 2015–16, shares of 372 exclusively listed companies at RSEs were made available for buying/selling on the dissemination board of NSE. Similarly at BSE, in 2015–16, the shares of 1,422 exclusively listed companies at RSEs were made available for buying/selling on the dissemination board.

## **Listing Of Securities**

#### **Listing of Securities**

- Permits trading
- Unlocks the value of the company
- Creates wealth effect

A company has to list its securities on the exchange so that they are available for trading. A company can seek listing on more than one stock exchange. Earlier, it was compulsory to list on the regional stock exchange that is nearest to its registered office, but now it is not mandatory. A security listed on one exchange is permitted for trading on the other.

A company seeking listing of its securities on the stock exchange is required to file an application, in the prescribed form, with the Exchange before issue of Prospectus by the company, where the securities are issued by way of a prospectus or before issue of Offer for Sale, where the securities are issued by way of an offer for sale. The prospectus should state the names of the stock exchanges, where the securities are proposed to be listed. It has to enter into a listing agreement with the stock exchange. As per Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956, a company seeking listing of its securities on a stock exchange is required to submit a letter of application to all the stock exchanges where it proposes to have its securities listed, before filing the prospectus with the registrar of companies. Section 21 of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956, deals with the listing of the public companies. Section 19 of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules, 1957, deals with the requirements and documents to be submitted with respect to the listing of securities on a recognized stock exchange. The documents that need to be submitted are: Memorandum and articles of association and, in case of a debenture issue, a copy of the trust deed, prospectus or statements in lieu of prospectus, offers for sale and circulars or advertisements offering any securities for subscription or sale during the last 5 years, balance sheets and audited accounts for the last 5 years, or in the case of new companies, for such shorter period for which accounts have been made up; a statement showing dividends and cash bonuses, if any, paid during the last 10 years (or such shorter period as the company has been in existence, whether as a private or public company) and dividends or interest in arrears, if any; certified copies of agreements or other documents relating to arrangements with or between vendors and/or promoters, underwriters and sub-underwriters, and brokers and sub-brokers; a statement containing particulars of the dates of, and parties to all material contracts, agreements (including agreements for technical advice and collaboration), concessions and similar other documents (except those entered into in the ordinary course of business carried on or intended to be carried on by the company), together with a brief description of the terms, subject matter and general nature of the documents; a brief history of the company since its incorporation giving details of its activities including any reorganization, reconstruction or amalgamation, changes in its capital structure (authorized, issued and subscribed) and debenture borrowings, if any; particulars of shares and debentures issued (i) for consideration other than cash, whether in whole or part, (ii) at a premium or discount or (iii) in pursuance of an option; and a statement containing particulars of any commission, brokerage, discount or other special terms including an option for the issue of any kind of the securities granted to any person. The SEBI issues guidelines/circulars prescribing certain norms to be included in the listing agreement and to be complied by the companies.

In case the exchange does not admit the company's securities for listing, the company cannot proceed with the allotment of shares. However, the company may file an appeal before SEBI under Section 22 of Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA, 1956), and also to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).

A company delisted by a stock exchange and seeking relisting at the same exchange is required to make a fresh public offer and comply with the extant guidelines of the exchange. Provisions in the listing agreement attempt to ensure liquidity and investor protection in the stock market. There were 5,900 securities listed on exchanges and around 6,94,000 unlisted companies in India at the end of March 2009. Unlisted companies follow provisions under the Companies Act which are less stringent. Because the compliance cost of listing are high, companies do not prefer to get listed on the stock exchanges. The compliance costs for listed companies include expenses for carrying out legal formalities, costs for communicating quarterly and annual financial reports to shareholders, printing and posting costs of reports, listing fee to the exchanges and reporting board decisions to exchanges.

A company can seek listing if at least 10 per cent of the securities, subject to a minimum of 20-lakh securities, have been offered to the public for subscription. In addition, the size of the net offer to the public (*i.e.*, the offer price multiplied by the number of securities offered to the public, excluding reservations, firm allotment and promoters' contribution) is not less than  $\overline{x}$ 100 crores and the issue is made only through bookbuilding method with 60 per cent of the issue size allocated to the qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Alternatively, a company has to offer at least 25 per cent of the securities to the general public.

A company needs to obtain 'in-principle' approval for listing from the exchanges having nationwide trading terminals where it is listed, before issuing further shares or securities. Where the company is not listed on any exchange having nationwide trading terminals, it needs to obtain such 'in-principle' approval from all the exchanges in which it is listed before issuing further shares or securities. Moreover, the equity-listing agreement has been amended to prohibit listed companies from issuing shares with superior rights as to voting or dividend vis-à-vis the rights on the equity shares that are already listed.

The basic norms for listing of securities are uniform for all exchanges. They are specified in the listing agreement entered into between the company and the concerned exchange and their compliance is monitored by the exchanges. The stock exchanges levy annual listing fees from the listed companies; this constitutes their major source of income.

The following eligibility criteria have been prescribed effective August 1, 2006 for listing of companies on BSE, through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs):

The post-issue timeline for listing has been reduced from T + 12 days to  $T + 6$  days, increasing the reach of retail investors and reducing the costs involved in a public issue of equity shares and convertibles.
Companies have been classified as large-cap companies and small-cap companies. A large-cap company is a company with a minimum issue size of  $\bar{x}$ 10 crores and market capitalization of not less than  $\bar{x}$ 25 crores. A small-cap company is a company other than a large-cap company.

- 1. In respect of Large-Cap Companies: The minimum post-issue paid-up capital of the applicant company shall be  $\bar{\tau}3$  crores; issue size shall be  $\bar{\tau}10$  crores; and the market capitalization of the company shall be  $\bar{\tau}$ 25 crores (market capitalization shall be calculated by multiplying the postissue paid-up number of equity shares with the issue price).
- 2. In respect of Small-Cap Companies: The minimum post-issue paid-up capital of the Company shall be  $\overline{\tau}3$  crores; the issue size shall be  $\overline{\tau}3$  crores; the market capitalization of the Company shall be  $\overline{\xi}$  crores; the income/turnover of the Company shall be  $\overline{\xi}$  crores in each of the preceding three 12-month period; and number of public shareholders after the issue shall be 1,000. A due diligence study may be conducted by an independent team of Chartered Accountants or Merchant Bankers appointed by BSE, the cost of which will be borne by the company. The requirement of a due diligence study may be waived if a financial institution or a scheduled commercial bank has appraized the project in the preceding 12 months.

The BSE issued new listing norms in August 2002 for companies listed on other exchanges and seeking listing on the BSE. These companies should have a minimum issued and paid-up equity capital of  $\overline{3}$  crores, minimum net worth of  $\overline{3}20$  crores, profit-making track record of 3 years, minimum market cap at two times its paid-up capital, and a dividend track record for three consecutive years with a minimum dividend of at least 10 per cent. Besides, there should be a two-year track record of being listed on a regional exchange. At least 25 per cent of the issued capital should be with a non-promoter and no single shareholder should hold more than 0.5 per cent of the capital.

After a security is issued to the public and listed on a stock exchange, the issuing company has to make continuous disclosures relating to financial results, material information which would have a bearing on the performance of the company, and information in the form of a statement on the actual utilization of funds and actual profitability as against the projected utilization of funds and projected profitability, on a quarterly basis to the stock exchanges. To improve transparency, the SEBI made it mandatory for listed companies to provide their half-yearly results and disclose their balance sheets—audited or un-audited every 6 months to the stock exchanges. Listed companies will also be permitted to submit accounts under the international financial reporting standards (IFRS), which calls for greater disclosures.

The SEBI issued new norms for listing and raising of funds by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on November 9, 2009. According to the norms, Companies listed on the SME exchanges would be exempted from the eligibility norms applicable for IPOs and FPOs prescribed in the SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR). SEBI has prescribed a minimum IPO application size of  $\bar{\tau}1$  lakh in order to have informed, financially sound and well-researched investors with a certain risk-taking ability. The minimum trading lot under the SME platform would be Rs1 lakh. For listing on the main boards of NSE and BSE, an upper limit of  $\overline{z}25$  crores paid-up capital has been prescribed for a company wanting to be listed on the SME platform/exchange and having a minimum paid-up capital of  $\bar{\tau}$ 10 crores. In other words,  $\bar{\tau}$ 25 crores would be the maximum capital permissible to be raised under the SME platform. If the paid-up capital is more than  $\overline{z}25$  crores, trading will be on the main platform. The entire public offer of small and medium companies will have to be underwritten. The offer document will have to be filed with SEBI and the exchange. No observations would be issued by SEBI on the offer documents filed by the merchant bankers.

An exchange can take some disciplinary actions, including suspension/delisting of securities if a company fails to comply with the requirements. Delisting of securities means removal of securities of a listed company from the stock exchange where it was registered. As a result of this, the company ceases to be traded at that stock exchange. There are two methods for delisting: compulsory and voluntary.

A stock exchange may compulsorily delist the shares of a listed company under certain circumstances such as non-compliance with the listing agreement for a minimum period of 6 months, failure to maintain the minimum trading level of shares on the exchange, insider trading, manipulation of share prices, unfair market practices by promoters/directors, inability to meet current debt obligations or to adequately finance operations due to sickness, or has not paid interest on debentures for the last 2-3 years, or has become defunct, or there are no employees, or liquidator appointed. Under compulsory delisting, the promoter of the company shall be liable to compensate the shareholders of the company by paying them the fair value of the securities held by them and acquiring their securities, subject to their option to remain security holders with the company. In such a case, there is no provision for an exit route for the shareholders except that the stock exchanges would allow trading in the securities under the permitted category for a period of 1 year after delisting.

The SEBI has issued the delisting guidelines for voluntary delisting from any stock exchange other than the regional stock exchange. The companies need to obtain prior approval of the holders of the securities sought to be delisted, by a special resolution at a General Meeting of the company. The shareholders will be provided with an exit opportunity by the promoters or those who are in the control of the management.

Companies can get delisted from all stock exchanges following the substantial acquisition of shares. The regulations state that if the public shareholding goes down to 10 per cent or less of the voting capital of the company, the acquirer making the offer, has the option to buy the outstanding shares from the remaining shareholders at the same offer price. However, under the existing SEBI takeover code, the exit price is based on the average of the preceding 26-week high and low prices.

An exit-price mechanism called 'reverse book-building method' is used to arrive at the price at which the shares will be bought from the shareholders. However, an exit opportunity need not be given in cases where securities continue to be listed in a stock exchange having nationwide trading terminals.

Dual Listing of shares of companies is not allowed in India. Dual Listing allows a company to be listed on stock exchanges of two countries. This enables an investor to buy/sell shares in one country and sell/buy them in another country where they are listed. For example, Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever are listed on the stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and Rio Tinto Group is listed on the stock exchanges of Australia and the United Kingdom. Dual Listing is required when two companies in two countries enter into an agreement to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise (without an outright merger), while retaining their separate legal entity and the existing stock exchange listings. Bharti Airtel and the South Africa-based Telco, MTN sought dual listing of their shares where Bharti shares could be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and MTN on NSE or BSE. But the Indian government policy does not allow dual listing. There are many issues which need to be resolved to enable dual listing. Domestic trading in shares denominated in foreign currency is not permitted; and to enable this, the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the Companies Act need to be amended. Moreover, the Indian rupee needs to be fully convertible. In addition, the domestic company's and the foreign company's composition of Boards should be identical and the stock exchanges of both the countries should have similar rules and regulations.

Consolidation and Streamlining of Listing Requirements for Companies SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations) consolidate and streamline the provisions of existing listing agreements for different segments of the capital market equity (including convertibles) issued by the entities listed on the main board of stock exchanges; small and medium enterprises listed on the SME exchange and institutional trading platforms; non-convertible debt securities; non-convertible redeemable preference shares; Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs); and securitized debt instruments and units of various schemes issued by mutual funds. The listing regulations have, thus, been structured to provide ease of reference while consolidating all the listing requirements for the various types of securities listed on the stock exchanges into one single document.

The listing regulations are sub-divided into two parts: (a) substantive provisions incorporated in the main body of the listing regulations; and (b) procedural requirements provided in the schedules to the listing regulations.

### *The salient features of the Listing Regulations are:*

**a. Guiding Principles** The Listing Regulations provide the broad principles (in line with the IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation) for periodic disclosures by listed entities and also incorporate the principles for corporate governance (in line with the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance). These principles underlie the specific requirements prescribed in the different chapters of the Listing Regulations. In the event of the absence of any specific requirement or if there is ambiguity, these principles will serve to guide the listed entities.

**b. Common Obligations Applicable to All Listed Entities:** Obligations which are common to all the listed entities have been enumerated. These include general obligation of compliance of the listed entity, appointment of a common compliance officer, filings on an electronic platform and mandatory registration on SCORES.

**c. Specific Obligations:** Obligations which are applicable to specific types of securities have been incorporated under separate chapters.

**d. Obligations of Stock Exchanges and Actions in Case of Default:** Stock exchanges have been given the responsibility of monitoring compliance or the adequacy/accuracy of compliance with the provisions of the Listing Regulations and to take action for non-compliance.

**e. Ease of Reference:** Related provisions have been aligned and provided in one place for ease of reference. For example, all clauses dealing with disclosure of events or information which may be material or price sensitive which were spread across the listing agreement have been provided as a schedule to the Listing Regulations. All disclosures to be made on the website of the listed entity have been enumerated in a single place for ease of reference and all requirements pertaining to disclosures in the annual report have been combined.

**f. Streamlining and Segregation of Initial Issuance/Listing Obligations:** In order to ensure that there is no overlapping or confusion on the applicability of the Listing Regulations, pre-listing requirements have been incorporated in respective regulations–ICDR Regulations, ILDS Regulations, etc. These provisions pertain to allotment of securities, refund and payment of interest, a 1 per cent security deposit (in case of public issuance), etc. Post-listing requirements have been incorporated in the Listing Regulations.

**g. Alignment with the Provisions of the Companies Act, 2013:** Wherever necessary, the provisions of the Listing Regulations have been aligned with those of the Companies Act, 2013.

**h. Listing Agreement:** A shortened version of the listing agreement (about two pages) has been prescribed which is required to be signed by a company getting its securities listed on the stock exchanges. Existing listed entities are required to sign the new listing agreement within six months of the notification of the Listing Regulations.

#### *Listing Compliance:*

SEBI envisaged and implemented four levels of monitoring for listed entities by way of regulations and guidelines. At the first level, company secretaries and the respective boards of directors of the listed entities will monitor the compliance of various regulatory requirements. Compliance reports on corporate governance and the report of an independent company secretary on compliance related issues are now required to be placed before the boards of listed entities. The boards are required to review the compliance reports as well as corrective steps taken in case of any non-compliance.

At the second level, an independent practising company secretary will review compliance and will certify the same as required under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The certification in this regard is published in the annual report of the company which, inter-alia, includes the observations of the practicing company secretary. As mentioned earlier, SEBI has made it mandatory that such reports (along with the corrective steps taken) should be placed before their boards.

At the third level, the stock exchanges will monitor compliance or regulatory requirements of listed companies. Based on their monitoring they may levy fines, penalties, freeze the promoters' holdings in the company or suspend trading in the securities of the company depending on the level of non-compliance. At the fourth level, SEBI will have overall regulatory oversight on the compliance standards of the corporate sector through various reports received from the stock exchanges.

### **Risk Management**

The SEBI has laid down risk management policies to mitigate market, operational and systemic risks. Designing effective risk management policies leads to enhancement of investor protection and market development.

On the instructions of the SEBI, the stock exchanges have developed a comprehensive risk management system to promote a safe and efficient market. Stock exchanges have laid down trading rules and regulations for broker-members, set up market surveillance systems to curb excess volatility, created trade/settlement guarantee fund to ensure timely settlements even if a member defaults to deliver securities or pay cash, and set up a clearing corporation to guarantee financial settlement of all trades and thereby reduce credit risk in the settlement system. The Clearing Corporation matches the transactions, reconciles sales and purchases and daily settlements. It is also responsible for the risk management of its members and conducts inspection and surveillance. It also collects margins and capital from members and monitors their net worth requirement. Its major role is to ensure the fulfilment of every contract either by becoming a counter-party itself to every trade or by guaranteeing the performance of all trades. This risk management system was absent in the pre-reforms period and the setting up of the system is one of the landmark achievements of financial market reforms.

## **Trading Rules and Regulations**

Strict rules and regulations have been framed to prevent unfair trading practices and insider trading. The trading rules relate to the margin system, intra-day trading limit and exposure limit. Brokers are levied various types of margins such as daily margins, mark-to-market margins, ad hoc margins and volatility margins to check price volatility.

Stock exchanges impose different types of margins on brokers for individual stocks, depending on the exposures taken by these brokers in these stocks, both on a proprietary basis and on behalf of clients, vis-à-vis the overall market exposure in the scrips. Several of these margins are paid upfront by brokers.

These margins are collected to prevent operators from taking market positions in excess of their buying capacities and are used to settle dues to the exchange/clearing corporation/traders in the event of any fund shortage faced by the broker. The margins vary from operator to operator depending on the size of the positions taken in the market. There is a real-time monitoring of the intra-day trading limits and gross exposure limits by the stock exchanges. There is an automatic deactivation of trading terminals in case of breach of exposure limits. The collection of margins from institutional clients is on  $T+1$  basis.

As a large section of the market makes margin payments by routing trades through brokers who pay lower margins, the SEBI stipulated that the stock brokers/sub-brokers of one exchange cannot deal with the brokers/sub-brokers of the same exchange either for proprietary trading or for trading on behalf of the clients without prior permission. It has also stipulated that a stock broker/sub-broker of an exchange can deal with only one broker/sub-broker of another exchange for proprietary trading offer, intimating the names of such stock broker/sub-broker to his parent stock exchange.

If the markets become volatile, the exchanges impose different types of margins such as value-at-risk (VaR) to minimize the risk of default by either counter-party. The system of collecting margins is devised in such a manner that higher exposures attract higher margins. Besides the normal margin, scrips with unusually high trading volumes attract special margins or a special ad hoc margin to keep defaults at bay.

The SEBI has shifted the margining system from net basis to gross basis (sale and purchase) with effect from September 3, 2001, and introduced a 99 per cent VaR-based margin for all scrips in the compulsory rolling system with effect from July 2, 2001. VaR measures the worst-expected potential loss from an unlikely adverse event in a normal, everyday market environment. Prior to VaR, trade positions were reported at book value only and no considerations were made for market changes. This margin is kept in a manner that covers price movements for more than 99 per cent of the time. Usually, three sigma (standard deviation) is used for the measurement.

The intra-day trading limits, that is, limit to volume is specified and no broker's trading volume can exceed this limit. If a broker wishes to exceed the limit he has to deposit the additional capital with the exchange. The upper limit for the gross exposure of a broker is fixed at 20 times his capital to ensure market safety. Besides these, there are capital adequacy norms for members, indemnity insurance and online-position monitoring by exchanges.

To ensure fair trading practices, the SEBI has formulated Insider Trading Regulations prohibiting insider trading by making it a criminal offence. To enhance transparency of the takeover process and to protect the interests of the minority shareholders, there are now separate regulations relating to acquisitions and takeovers.

# **Circuit Breakers**

To contain the excessive volatility in prices, the SEBI introduced, in 1995, scripwise daily circuit breakers/ price bands. The circuit breakers bring about a halt/suspension in trading, automatically for a specified period, if the market prices vary unusually on either side, that is, move out of a pre-specified band. Circuit breakers do not halt trading but no order is permitted if it falls out of the specified price range.

Circuit breakers allow participants to gather new information and assess the situation. This helps in controlling the panic. It helps exchange-clearing houses to monitor their members. However, the introduction of circuit breakers precipitates matters during volatile moves and leads to chaos as participants rush to execute their orders before an anticipated trading halt.

In the United States, the system of circuit breakers was introduced in 1987 to halt a sharp fall in share prices. In India, circuit breakers are used to halt both sharply rising as well as declining prices. Price bands, which were originally fixed at 8 per cent, were relaxed in case of 100 scrips in January 2000, when a further variation of 4 per cent in the scrip beyond 8 per cent was allowed after a cooling-off period of 30 minutes. In June 2000, the price band was relaxed by 8 per cent from 4 per cent in case of scrips under rolling settlement. These price bands were removed for all stocks in the rolling mode from July 2, 2001, and for the entire market from January 2, 2002. An index-based, market-wide circuit-breaker system at three stages of the index movement, either way at 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent is now applied. To enhance safety, individual scripwise price bands of 20 per cent either way have been prescribed for all securities except those available for trading in the derivatives segment, and new listings.

For the first time since their introduction in July 2001, the Sensex and Nifty attracted the index-wide circuit filters and trading on BSE and NSE was halted two times (for a total of 3 hours) on May 17, 2004. Monday, May 17, witnessed the biggest intra-day fall (842.37 points or 17.59 per cent) and the secondbiggest, single-day fall (564.71 points or 11.14 per cent) of the Sensex. The market reacted adversely to the statements of some leaders of the new Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government regarding policy matters including disinvestment in the PSUs, liberalization of foreign-direct investment (FDI) norms and the sale of non-performing assets by banks and financial institutions. On November 26, 2008, markets hit lower circuits on the news of global financial crisis. For the first time on Monday, May 18, 2009, markets hit two upper circuits (first circuit at over 10 per cent and the next at 20 per cent) when a clear mandate for the Congress-led UPA was announced. May 18, 2009 was the reverse of May 17, 2004. Trading was halted within seconds of opening of the markets when the 30-share Sensex surged 14.70 per cent or 1,789.88 points to 13,963.30 and the 50-unit S&P CNX Nifty gained 531.65 points or 14.48 per cent to 4203.30.

### **Box 8.2** Index-wide Circuit Breakers

The BSE and the NSE implement the index-based market-wide circuit breaker system on a daily basis based on the previous day's closing level of the index. The market-wide circuit breakers would be triggered by movement of either the Sensex or the NSE S&P CNX Nifty whichever is breached earlier.

- In case of a 10 per cent movement of either of these indices, there would be a one-hour market halt if the movement takes place before 1 p.m. In case, the movement takes place at or after 1 p.m. but before 2:30 p.m., there will be a trading halt for one-half hour. In case the movement takes place at or after 2.30 p.m., there will be no trading halt at the 10 per cent level and the market will continue trading.
- In case of a 15 per cent movement of either index, there will be a two-hour market halt if the movement takes place before 1 p.m. If the 15 per cent trigger isreached on or after 1 p.m. but before 2 p.m., there will be a one-hour halt. If the 15 per cent trigger is reached on or after 2 p.m. the trading will halt for the remainder of the day.
- In case of a 20 per cent movement of the index, the trading will be halted for the remainder of the day.

As an additional measure of safety, individual scrip-wise price bands have been fixed by as

- i. In addition to the market wide index based circuit filters, there are individual scrip wise price bands of 20% either way, for all scrips in the compulsory rolling settlement except for the scrips on which derivatives products are available orscripsincluded in indices on which derivative products are available.
- ii. Appropriate individualscrip wise price bands upto 20% shall be applicable on those scrips on which no derivatives products are available but which are part of index derivatives.

Daily price bands of 2 per cent (either way) on a set of specified securities

Daily price bands of 5 per cent (either way) on a set of specified securities

Daily price banks of 10 per cent (either way) on specified securities

Price bands of 20 per cent (either way) on all remaining securities (including debentures, warrants, preference shares etc. which are traded on CM segment of NSE),

No price bands are applicable on: scrips on which derivative products are available or scrips included in indices on which derivatives products are available.

- To further strengthen the mechanism of index based market-wide circuit breaker as under:
- (a) NSE and BSE shall compute their market-wide index (NIFTY and SENSEX respectively) after every trade in the index constituent stocks and shall check for breach of market-wide circuit breaker limits after every such computation of the market-wide index.
- (b) In the event of breach of market-wide circuit breaker limit, stock exchange shall stop matching of orders in order to bring about a trading halt. All unmatched orders present in the system shall thereupon be purged by the stock exchange.
- (c) BSE and NSE shall implement suitable mechanism to ensure that all messages related to market-wide index circuit breakers are given higher priority over other messages. Further, the systems (including the network) for computation of market-wide index, checking for breach of circuit breaker limits and initiating message to stop matching of executable order and acceptance of fresh orders, shall not be used for any other purposes.
- (d) BSE and NSE shall include in the scope of their annual system audit a review of its index based market-wide circuit breaker mechanism with the view to identify improvements.

# **Dematerialization of Securities**

To eliminate various problems such as theft, fake/forged transfers, transfer delays and the paperwork associated with physical certificates, an electronic book entry form of holding and transferring securities has been introduced. Investors have the option to hold securities in either physical or dematerialized form. In order to expedite the process of dematerialization, the SEBI has mandated the compulsory settlement of trade in demat form in certain select scrips. Securities issued through an IPO can be settled only in a dematerialized form. Henceforth, all IPOs will be issued in the dematerialized form. Two depositories—the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and the Central Depository Service Limited (CDSL)—offer trading facility in the dematerialized form. The dematerialization process is almost complete and more than 99 per cent of the turnover settled by delivery is in the dematerialized form.

# **Trading Arrangements**

The open outcry system, prevalent a few years ago on regional stock exchanges, has been replaced by an online, screen-based electronic trading system. The NSE and the OTCEI had adopted screen-based trading right from inception. With almost all the exchanges going electronic, trading has shifted from the floor to the brokers' office where trades are executed through a computer terminal. All stock exchanges together have 8,000 terminals spread across the country. In a screen-based trading system, a member can feed into the computer the number of securities and the prices at which he would like to transact and the transaction is executed as soon as it finds a matching order from a counter party. The electronic trading system is superior to the open outcry system of the past. It ensures transparency, as it enables participants to see the full market during real time. It increases information efficiency by allowing a faster incorporation of price-sensitive information into prevailing prices and thereby helps in an efficient price discovery. This also results in the operational efficiency as there is a reduction in time, cost, risk of error, and fraud and elimination of a chain of brokers and jobbers, which result in low transaction costs. This system has enabled a large number of participants, in every part of the country, to trade in full anonymity with one another simultaneously, thereby improving the depth and liquidity of the market. This has led to the integration of different trading centres spread all over the country into a single trading platform.

The SEBI has permitted the setting up of trading terminals abroad as well as Internet trading. Now, investors in any part of the world can route the order through the Internet for trading in Indian scrips. Internet trading is more cost effective than using trading terminals.

There are two types of trading systems—order-driven trading system and quote-driven trading system. In the order-driven system, orders from all over the country are entered into an electronic system and matched directly and continuously without the involvement of a jobber or a market maker. In the quotedriven system, there are market makers who continuously offer two-way quotes—buy-and-sell quotes and are willing to buy and sell any quantity. The BSE provides both these systems while the NSE provides only the order-driven system.

There are two types of orders: limit orders and market orders. Limit orders are those trades which will be only executed at the price specified by the investor. Usually, retail investors and fund houses place limit orders. Market orders are those trades which are executed at the latest quoted bid or offer price on the trading screen.

There are certain orders (buy or sell) which already exist in the trade book at the time of trade matching which are known as passive orders. While active orders are incoming orders that are matched against the passive orders, stock exchanges charge different transaction fees for both passive and active orders.

#### **Steps Involved in Online Trading**

1. An investor/trader needs to sign the 'member–client agreement' if dealing directly with a broker or a 'broker–sub-broker–client tripartite agreement' if dealing with a sub-broker in order to execute trades on his behalf from time to time. An investor/trader has also to furnish details such as permanent account number (PAN), which has been made mandatory for all the investors participating in the securities market;,his name, date of birth, photograph, address, educational qualifications, occupation, residential status (Resident Indian/NRI/others); bank and depository account details; and if registered with any other broker, then the name of that broker and the concerned stock exchange and the Client Code Number in the client registration form. All brokers have been mandated to use the unique client code that is linked to the PAN details of the respective client, which will act as an exclusive identification for the client. The broker

### **Electronic Trading Systems**

- Ensures transparency
- Increases information efficiency.
- Increases operational efficiency.
- Improves depth and liquidity of the market.
- Provides a single trading platform.

opens a trading account in the name of the investor for maintenance of transactions executed, while buying and selling the securities.

- 2. An investor has to open a Beneficial Owner Account (BO Account)/Demat Account with a depository participant in his name for the purpose of holding and transferring securities. He also has to open a bank account which is used for debiting or crediting money for trading in the securities market.
- 3. Investor/trader who wants to trade places order with a broker to buy/sell the required quantity of specified securities.
- 4. The order is matched at the best price based on the price–time priority.
- 5. The order which is executed electronically is communicated to the broker's terminal.
- 6. The broker issues the trade confirmation slip to the investor/trader.
- 7. The broker issues contract note to the investor/trader within 24 hours of trade execution. A contract note is a confirmation of trades done on a particular day on behalf of the client by the broker. It imposes a legally enforceable relationship between the client and the broker with respect to purchase/sale and settlement of trades. It also helps to settle disputes/claims between the investor and the broker.

 The stock exchanges assign a Unique Order Code Number to each transaction, and once the order is executed, this order code number is printed on the contract note. The time when the investor/trader has placed the order and the time of execution of the order have to be mentioned in the contract note.

- 8. The payment for the shares purchased or delivery of shares in case of sale of shares is required to be done prior to the pay-in date for the relevant settlement.
- 9. Pay-in of funds and securities take place before  $T+2$  day as the settlement cycle is on  $T+2$ rolling-settlement basis, w.e.f. April 1, 2003. Pay-in day is the day when the broker shall make payment or delivery of securities to the exchange.
- 10. Pay-out of funds and securities take place on  $T+2$  day. Pay-out day is the day when the exchange makes payment or delivery of securities to the broker. The broker makes payment to the investor/ trader within 24 hours of the payout.
- 11. The investor/trader can get direct delivery of shares in his beneficial owner account. To avail this facility, he has to give details of his beneficial owner account and the DP-ID of his Depository Participant (DP) to his broker along with the standing instructions for 'Delivery-In' to his DP for accepting shares in his beneficial owner account. After the receipt of these instructions, the clearing corporation/clearing house sends pay-out instructions to the depositories and the investor/trader receives pay-out of securities directly into his beneficial owner account.
- 12. In case of short or bad (non) delivery of funds/securities, an auction of securities on the pay-in day is held to settle the delivery. The Exchange purchases the required quantity in the Auction Market and delivers them to the buying trading member. The shortages are met through auction process and the difference in price indicated in the contrac t note and the price received through auction is paid by the member in the Exchange, which is then liable to be recovered from the client. Auction ensures that the buying trading member receives the securities. The Exchange purchases the requisite quantity in auction market and gives them to the buying trading member. Auction price applicable is previous day's close price.

In case the shares could not be bought in the auction, the transaction is closed out as per SEBI guidelines. The guidelines stipulate that the close-out price will be the highest price recorded in that scrip on the exchange in the settlement in which the concerned contract was entered into and up to the date of auction/close out or 20 per cent above the official closing price on the exchange on the day on which auction offers are called for (and in the event of there being no such closing price on that day, then the previous day's closing price), whichever is higher.

### **Direct-Market Access**

The SEBI allowed trading members (Brokers) to offer Direct Market Access (DMA) to institutional clients such as foreign institutional investors (FIIs), mutual funds and insurance companies in April 2008. These institutional clients can directly execute their buy-and-sell orders without any manual intervention by their brokers. The benefits of DMA are:

1. It prevents the practice of front-running by brokers who are trading ahead of the client based on the knowledge of the client order. Brokers profit from the price changes which take place when large institutional orders are placed. With DMA, the secrecy of the orders can be maintained as the orders are routed directly through the computer system.

- 2. It enables a faster execution of orders with a minimal risk of errors from the manual order entry.
- 3. It reduces malpractices and price manipulation, enhances transparency and increases liquidity as the orders are visible to the entire market rather than to a particular person/group.
- 4. It results in lower impact costs for large orders. Moreover, institutional client can break large orders into smaller ones, thereby reducing the bid-ask spread. In addition, it results in saving, in the form of low brokerage charges.
- 5. It enables **algorithmic trading** wherein the traders instal computers running complex mathematical algorithms and place buy-and-sell orders automatically in the trading system through DMA. Algorithmic trading or program trading is a software program built on certain mathematical models, which enables traders to detect an arbitrage opportunity between the cash and the futures market and place orders on exchanges in real time. It enhances efficiency in trading, reduces transaction costs and prevents information leakage. Foreign broking firms such as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse offer these trading services.

Algorithmic trading is popular in developed countries but it has not taken off in a big way in India because of lack of liquidity beyond the top 15–20 actively traded scrips and both the exchanges' systems not being equipped to handle very heavy orders of trades, when the market is unusually active.

# **Bulk Deal**

A 'bulk" deal constitutes all transactions in a scrip (on an exchange) where the total quantity of shares bought/sold is more than 0.5 per cent of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the exchange. The quantitative limit of 0.5 per cent can be reached through one or more transactions executed during the day in the normal market segment.

## **Disclosures**

- 1. The disclosure shall be made with respect to all transactions in a scrip where total quantity of shares bought/sold is more than 0.5 per cent of the number of equity shares of the company listed on the stock exchange.
- 2. The brokers shall disclose to the stock exchange the name of the scrip, name of the client, quantity of shares bought/sold and the traded price.
- 3. The disclosure shall be made by the brokers immediately upon execution of the trade.
- 4. The Stock exchanges shall disseminate the aforesaid information on the same day after market hours to the general public.

# **Block Deal**

Block deal is execution of large trades through a single transaction without putting either the buyer or seller in a disadvantageous position. For this purpose, stock exchanges are permitted to provide a separate trading window. Block deal will be subject to the following conditions:

- 1. The said trading window may be kept open for a limited period of 35 minutes from the beginning of trading hours *i.e.*, the trading window shall remain open from 9.15 am to 9.50 am.
- 2. The orders may be placed in this window at a price not exceeding +1% (Explanation for you: It is  $+/- 1\%$ ) from the ruling market price/previous day closing price, as applicable.
- 3. An order may be placed for a minimum quantity of 5,00,000 shares or minimum value of  $\bar{z}$ 5 crore.
- 4. Every trade executed in this window must result in delivery and shall not be squared off or reversed.
- 5. The stock exchanges shall disseminate the information on block deals such as the name of the scrip, name of the client, quantity of shares bought/sold, traded price, etc to the general public on the same day, after the market hours.
- 6. Disclosure of trade details of 'bulk deals' as specified above shall be continued to be made by the stock exchanges to the general public on the same day after the market hours.

All appropriate trading and settlement practices as well as surveillance and risk containment measures, etc., as applicable to the normal trading segment, shall be applicable and implemented in respect of this special window as well.

## **Negotiated Deals**

- 1. All negotiated deals (including cross deals) shall not be permitted except for those which are executed on the screens of the exchanges in the price and order matching mechanism of the exchanges just like any other normal trade. Provided, however, that Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) can avail of the provisions of the special bargains on the exchanges in accordance with their bye-laws or obtain suitable exemptions from exchanges for purchases or sales between FIIs in such companies where the ceiling of FII investment of 24 per cent or 30 per cent as the case may be, has been reached.
- 2. Negotiated deals in listed corporate debt securities shall not be permitted and all such trades will have to be executed on the price and order matching mechanism of the stock exchanges as in the case of equities.
- 3. Government debt securities and money market instruments are under the regulatory jurisdiction of RBI and do not fall within the purview of SEBI. Therefore the aforesaid decision will not apply to such securities.
- 4. Exemptions would also be granted for dis-investment of Public Sector Enterprises by SEBI on a case to case basis.
- 5. No Exchange shall allow the 'All or None' or 'Minimum Fill' order facility in their trading system

## **Trading and Settlement**

After the reforms, the trading-and-settlement cycle was trimmed from 14 days to 7 days. Later on, securities were traded and settled under a uniform weekly-settlement cycle. In a trading cycle, trades accumulated till the end of a specified period and the positions were settled in the form of payment of cash and delivery of securities. The carry-forward system prevailed for a long period at stock exchanges, as it increased the volume of trading and thereby added to the liquidity of the system. However, it also increased the speculation which, in turn, increased the volatility in prices and defaults by brokers, thereby impeding the price-discovery process. Hence, an alternative system called 'rolling settlement' was introduced in a phased manner.

Under the  $T+5$  basis rolling-settlement system, the trading cycle comprises 1 day and transactions in these securities are settled 5 days after the trade date. The rolling settlement on a  $T+5$  basis was introduced in 10 scrips in January 2000, extended to another 153 scrips in May 2000 and then to 414 securities in July 2001; and thereafter, all scrips were covered under this system. From April 2002, the rolling settlement was on a  $T+3$  basis but since April 2003 it is on a  $T+2$  basis (transactions in securities are settled 2 days after the trade date). Effective implementation and success of the rolling settlement requires electronic fund-transfer facility and dematerialization.

### **Rolling settlement**

In April 2002, the Indian capital markets introduced T+3 rolling settlement cycle. The settlement cycle of T+3 under the Rolling Settlement System, was shortened further to T+2 rolling settlement, w.e.f. April 01, 2003.

### *Systems for Effecting Settlement on T+2 basis*

Activity Schedule for T+2 Rolling Settlement

The activity schedule is as under:

| SI. No. | Day     | Time                                              | <b>Description of Activity</b>                                                                                                                                         |
|---------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         | T       | By 1.00 p.m.                                      | Trade Day                                                                                                                                                              |
|         |         |                                                   | Completion of custodial confirmation of trades to CC/CH. (There is no<br>separate extended time limit for late confirmations).                                         |
|         | $T + 1$ | By $2.30$ p.m.                                    | Completion of process and download obligation files to brokers/custodi-<br>ans by the CC/CH.                                                                           |
|         | $T + 2$ | Until 10.30 a.m.<br>By 10.30 p.m.<br>By 1.30 p.m. | Accept Pay-in instructions from investors into pool account.<br>Submit final pay-in files to the depository and the clearing bank.<br>Pay-out of securities and funds. |

The stock exchanges shall also put in place the following systems for effecting settlement on  $T+2$ basis:

- 1. A facility of late confirmation of trades by the custodians shall be provided. However, the time limit for late confirmation shall be fixed in a manner that the download of the final obligation files to brokers is not delayed.
- 2. The stock exchanges would levy an additional charge to discourage late confirmations by the custodians.
- 3. The stock exchanges would provide a system for handling shortages of funds and securities in an expeditious manner to adhere to the time schedule for pay-out.
- 4. The stock exchanges would also amend their byelaws to mandate the pay out of funds and securities to the clients by the broker within 24 hours of the payout.
- 5. The stock exchanges shall design an alternative clearing and settlement system in respect of companies whose shares have not been dematerialized to align the clearing and settlement system for such stocks with the  $T + 2$  rolling settlement.
- 6. The stock exchanges shall not normally permit changes in the Client ID and would keep a strict vigil on cases of client code modification and would implement a monetary penalty structure that would escalate with the number of such incidences. Besides, the exchanges may take necessary action against members making repeated changes. However, genuine mistakes may be allowed to be rectified.
- 7. Stock exchanges would encourage members to adopt automatic downloading of pay-in files for securities and funds. The members would also be encouraged to adopt direct transfer of securities/funds to clients' account on pay-out. The stock exchanges may also provide the following facilities desirable for further smoothing clearing and settlement process, though these may not be pre-conditions for introduction of  $T + 2$  rolling settlement:
  - i. Facility of online confirmation of trades by custodians.
  - ii. System to capture the details of the client's depository account and bank account.
  - iii. System for online transmitting the client wise pay-in obligation to depository so that the depository in turn could download the security pay-in instructions to depository participants in respect of the investor maintaining account with them.
  - iv. System wherein the pay-out files could be sent to the clearing banks with a request to online credit to the bank accounts of the clients.
  - v. The stock exchanges would support development of front end software for brokers to map the Client ID through abbreviated keys to facilitate faster order entry for inserting the unique client code speedily.

### *Activity Schedule for Auction Session*

In the equity segment of stock exchanges, in case of default by the selling broker in a normal settlement, the security delivered short is bought in the auction session (conducted on T+2 day) and is delivered to the buying broker on T+3 day. With a view to facilitating reduction of the time involved in delivering the shares to the buying broker in case of default by the selling broker clearing corporations have been provided the flexibility to decide the time for conducting the settlement of the auction session on or before T+3 day. Thus, the activity schedule for conducting the settlement of the auction session and the close-out has been revised as:

| Auction session                         | $\rm\,By\,T+2$ |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Pay-in/pay-out of auction and close-out | $By T+3$       |

Incase of bank holidays, when multiple settlements (say  $S_1$  and  $S_2$ ) are conducted on the same day (say  $T_m$ ), on the working day immediately following the day(s) of the closure, the auction session shall be as under:

- 1. The auction of first settlement  $(S_1)$  shall be conducted on the same day  $(T_m)$  and settled the next day  $(T + 1)$ .
- 2. The auction for the second settlement  $(S_2)$  shall be conducted on the next day  $(T_m+1)$  along with the shortages/auction of that day. The settlement of the same shall happen on the subsequent day  $(T_m+2)$ .

### **INTERNET TRADING**

Internet trading in India made its debut in April 2000. Through this means of trading, investors can buy and sell shares online through the Internet.

To start Internet trading, an investor has to register himself with a broker offering online services. He has to open a bank account as well as a demat account with the broker. The broker is responsible for the risk management of his clients. The orders get logged directly on the trading platforms within the assigned limits designated by the broker to the clients. Even if the client order exceeds the assigned
limits, the order gets re-routed to the broker's server for authorization or rejection. The broker can change the parameters on-line. His software allows real time market information display, client information display, bank account management, and a transaction history display.

In April 2000, the market was bullish and a large number of players ventured into online (Internet) trading. As many as 79 members took permission for Internet trading. However, after the Ketan Parekh scam, barely 10 members remained online. The market is dominated by *ICICI Direct.com* with a market share of about 50 per cent and *India Bulls.com* with a market share of 26 per cent.

ICICI has emerged as a market leader because it can provide strong connectivity between the trading account, demat account, and bank accounts. Moreover, ICICI's huge off-line presence in various financial services segments and penetration aids in drawing as well as servicing customers. ICICI Direct leads the pack with 1,70,000 trading customers. It executes an average of 1,600 trades a day; this puts it in the same league as the tenth largest online brokerage in the US. *Sharekhan.com* and *5 paise.com* have faded away while *Kotak Street.com* and *HDFC Securities* are hanging on.

Around 44 lakh investors had registered to trade online as on March 31, 2008. There has been a sharp increase in volumes after the rolling settlement was introduced. The online trading volumes rose from  $\overline{(7,288)}$  crore in 2000–01 on the National Stock Exchange to  $\overline{(6,68,399)}$  crore in 2007–08. Around 11.68 per cent of the total trading volume was routed and executed through internet during 2007–08.

Online trading has driven down the transaction costs substantially and increased the liquidity options available to an investor to enter or exit from the stock at his own wish. The Internet has provided a wide range of information to the investor which has enabled him to take calculated risks.

The US has the largest number of cyber investors—approximately 15 million. Online trading has grown tremendously in the US where roughly 40 per cent of retail stock brokerage business is conducted through the Internet. Schwab, a US-based company, is the world's largest discount and web brokerage firm with 5.8 million investor accounts holding more than USD 500 billion in assets.

Compare this with Indian online trading statistics. Online trading represents about 18 per cent of the total traded volumes on the NSE and the BSE.

The stumbling blocks for such low online trading volumes are as follows:

- Erratic bandwidth and erratic net connectivity coupled with low personal computer (PC) penetration.
- Low security and inadequate cyber laws.
- Lack of automation in the banking sector especially among public sector banks. Not many banks offer online transaction of money.
- Incremental and ongoing investment in technology and brand building are required. This is owing to lack of funding for Internet-based business.
- Stipulation from the SEBI—Know Your Customer (KYC)—which requires that companies actually meet their customers before allowing them to trade on their site. This requires a large off-line structure which most of the companies do not have.
- A big time lag of 5–10 minutes between the placing of an order and its execution. The high volatility prevailing in the market leads to fluctuations in prices.
- High cost of transactions as online brokers charge brokerage as steep as 0.20–0.25 per cent for nondelivery based transaction and between 0.50–0.75 per cent for delivery based transaction.
- Absence of streaming data on the investor's computer. The broker gets streaming data on his computer while the client does not. Clients get a browser-based web application which works on a request reply model, most suited for document presentation,
- An online investor pays more margin for trading than the off-line investor and his funds are also tied up for more trading days.

#### **Box 8.3** To Trade Online Using e-broking Facility

- Register yourself with the online trading portals listed on the site.
- You must be a registered iconnect user.
- On placing an order for buy/sell of securities through the listed, online trading portal, click on 'Pay Through'—Bank listed on the
- online portal which will direct you to a login screen of your account.
- Once the details of your Login ID and password are entered, you are required to verify the transaction details and confi rm the
- transaction by entering your transaction ID and password. An email confi rmation will follow regarding the status of your transaction once your order is executed.
- Your account status will be updated on a real time basis.

• The high development, acquisition, maintenance and service costs. The cost of servicing one internet client may range between  $\overline{55,000}$ – $\overline{58,000}$  annually.

There is great potential for the growth of Internet trading in India. What is required is a regulatory authority to control this market; availability of high bandwidth, and an online infrastructure. Investor interest in Internet trading has to be sustained and this requires innovations and new products. Broking firms should devise distinct marketing and service strategies.

# **STOCK MARKET INDEX**

The stock market index is the most important indices of all as it measures overall market sentiment through a set of stocks that are representative of the market. The stock market index is a barometer of market behaviour. It reflects market direction and indicates day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices. The market index reflects expectations about the behaviour of the economy as a whole. It is a precursor of economic cycles. The function of a stock index is to provide investors with information regarding the average share price in the market. A wellconstructed index captures the overall behaviour of the market and represents the return obtained by a typical portfolio investing in the market. An ideal index must represent changes in the prices of scrips and reflect price movements of typical shares for better market representation. Stock index is a barometer of a nation's economic health as market prices reflect expectations about the economy's performance. Stock markets tend to be buoyant when the economy is expected to do well. The bell wether Sensex, if it touches the psychologically golden 35,000 mark, indicates that the country's fnancial and economic growth is surging ahead.

Stock indices are termed as leading economic indicators as they indicate what is going to happen in the economy in the future. The returns generated in the stock market are based on future expectations. The future streams of expected returns from the companies are discounted to arrive at their present value known as market price.

A good market index incorporates a set of scrips which have high market capitalization and high liquidity. Market capitalization is the sum of the market value of all the stocks included in the index. The market value is derived by multiplying the price of the share by the number of equity shares out-standing. Liquidity is reflected in the ability to buy or sell a scrip at a price close to the current market price. In other words, the bid–ask spread is minimum.

 The index on a day is calculated as the percentage of the aggregate market value of the set of scrips incorporated in the index on that day to the average market value of the same scrips during the base period. For example, the BSE Sensex is a weighted average of prices of 30 select stocks and S&P CNX Nifty of 50 select stocks.

## **Methodologies for Calculating the Index**

## **Market Capitalization Weighted**

- 1. **Full market capitalization method:** In this method, the number of shares outstanding multiplied by the market price of a company's share determines the scrip's weightage in the index. The shares with the highest market capitalization would have a higher weightage and would be most influential in this type of index. Examples: S&P 500 Index in USA and S&P CNX Nifty in India.
- 2. **Free-float market capitalization method:** Free-float is the percentage of shares that are freely available for purchase in the markets. It excludes strategic investments in a company such as the stake held by government, controlling shareholders and their families, the company's management, restricted shares due to IPO regulations, and shares locked under the employee stock ownership plan. In this methodology, the weight of a scrip is based on the free-float market capitalization. Free-float market capitalization reflects the investible market capitalization which may be much less than the total. Closely held companies would have a much lower weightage and companies with high free-float, *i.e.*, higher investible shares, would be rewarded. Companies which provide high shareholder value but have less free-float would be marginalized.

Free-float market capitalization method is superior to full market capitalization method in several ways.

- Free-float is rational in the sense that it factors in the constituent shares to the extent they are available for trading in the market. For instance, ONGC has a free-float of less than 15 per cent and hence it has a weight of under 5 per cent in the free-float weighted sensex.
- The free-float methodology helps in designing a broad-base index wherein the concentration of top few companies and their influence on index movement is reduced. It avoids the undue inf uence of closely held large capitalization stocks on the index movement and prices.
- An index-based on free-float methodology, is useful to active fund managers as it enables them to benchmark their fund returns vis-a-vis an investible index.
- It avoids multiple counting of company shares through cross holding.

## **Functions of an Index**

- To serve as a barometer of the equity market.
- To serve as a benchmark for portfolio of stocks.
- To serve as underlying for futures and options contracts.

#### **Categories of Holding Excluded from the Definition of Free-float**

- Holdings by founders/directors/ acquirers/bodies with controlling interest.
- Government hold-ing as promoter/acquirer.
- Holdings through the FDI route.
- Strategic stakes by private corporate bodies/individuals.
- Crossholdings by associate/group companies.
- Equity held by Employee Welfare Trusts.
- Locked-in shares.

Passive investing (index investing) in the developed market is around 10 per cent. The free-float index helps fund managers in better tracking and replication as the weight of scrips in the index is based on their float available in the market, which helps them in investing in those scrips. The free-float methodology has become popular the world over. Since June 2001, the entire range of FTSE (Financial Time Stock Exchange) indices are fully free-float adjusted. S&P's indices around the world are free-float. All Dow Jones indices except Dow Jones Industrial Average are free-float adjusted.

The BSE has taken a lead on free-floating the indices. It made a beginning by launching on July 11, 2001, the country's first free-float index, 'BSE-TECK Index,' an index for technology, entertainment, communication, and other knowledge-based sectors. The BSE has introduced this methodology in the case of the BSE sensex since September 1, 2003. Now the BSE sensex is a free-float sensex.

**Free-float Factors** The BSE has adopted the international practice of assigning a free-float factor to each company. Free-float factors are assigned according to a banding structure consisting of ten bands into which each company falls, based on its percentage of shares in free-float. The banding structure means that the actual free-float of a company is not taken as it is but rounded off to the higher multiple of 5 or 10 depending upon the banding structure adopted. The exact free-float of a company is roundedoff to the higher multiple of 10. For example, if the free-float factor of a company is, say, 16 per cent, a free-float factor of 0.2, *i.e.*, 20 per cent is applied. If the free-float factor changes, adjustment to the index is made only if the new free-float crosses either the lower band or the higher band by 2 percentage points. The free-float factor is then multiplied with the full market capitalization of the company to arrive at the free-float capitalization. Based on the percentage of a company's free-float capitalization to the total free-float capitalization of the sensex, weights are assigned to each company.

In order to reduce the frequency of index adjustments arising out of a change in free-float of a company, the BSE refined the banding structure and increased the number of bands from 10 to 20. In the 20 band system, a company having a free-float of 60.1 per cent would be assigned a free-float factor of 0.65 and another company having a free-float of 67 per cent would be assigned a free-float factor of 0.7. A Free-float factor of say 0.55 means that only 55 per cent of the market capitalization of the company will be considered for index calculation.

3. **Modified capitalization weighted:** This method seeks to limit the influence of the largest stocks in the index which otherwise would dominate the entire index. This method sets a limit on the percentage weight of the largest stock or a group of stocks. The NASDAQ-100 Index is calculated by using this method.

**Price Weighted Index** In this method, the price of each stock in the index is summed up which is then equated to an index starting value. An arbitrary date is set as the base and the Laspeyre's Price Index which measures price changes against a fixed base period quantity weight is used. In case of a stock-split, the market price of the stock falls and this results in less weightage in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nikkie 225 are price-weighted indices.

**Equal Weighting** In this method, each stock's percentage weight in the index is equal and hence, all stocks have an equal influence on the index movement. The value line index at Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT) is an equal weighted index.

# **Global Stock Market Indices**

**The Dow Jones lndustrial average** It is the most widely watched and quoted index because of its long existence. The Dow has 30 constituents and it follows the methodology of price-based weightage. Changes to stocks included in the Dow are infrequent: three stocks were added/dropped in 1991, four in 1997, and four in 1999. The addition of Microsoft and Intel in 1999 was the first inclusion of Nasdaq market stocks to the Dow 30.

**The Nasdaq composite index** This index is the market capitalization weightages of prices for all the stocks listed in the Nasdaq stock market. The Nasdaq Composite began on February 8, 1971, with a base of 100.

**The Nasdaq 100 index** Nasdaq 100 comprises the largest computer, software and telecom stocks by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. For a company to be included in the Nasdaq 100, it must have a minimum average trading volume of 1,00,000 shares per day and must have been trading on a major exchange for at least a year or two.

**The S&P 500 index** This index comprises 500 biggest publicly traded companies in the US by market capitalization. Most money managers treat the S&P 500 as a proxy for the US stock market. The S&P 500 tries to cover all major areas of the US economy. To be included, a company must be profitable, the prospective company must not be closely held (at least 50 per cent of its stock should be public) and must have a large trading volume for its shares (not less than a third of its total shares).

**The FTSE 100** The FTSE 100 consists of the largest 100 companies by full market value listed on the London Stock Exchange. The FTSE 100 is the benchmark index to indicate the performance of the European market. It is a market-capitalization-weighted index that also considers the free-float weightages of individual stocks before including them in the index.

**The MSCI Indices** Include the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and Far East), MSCI Europe, MSCI World, MSCI (EMF), and MSCI Pacific Basin Indices.

The MSCI World Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure global developed market equity performance. As of April 2002, the MSCI World Index consisted of the following 23 developed market country indices: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The MSCI EAFE Index is a free-float market capitalization index that is designed to measure developed market equity performance. As of April 2002, it consisted of 21 developed market country indices, excluding the US and Canada.

The MSCI EMF (Emerging Markets Free) Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity performance in the global emerging markets. As of April 2002, the MSCI EMF Index consisted of the following 26 emerging market country indices: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela.

## **Major Indices in India**

There are two major indices in India: BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. The BSE Sensitive Index of equity share prices was launched in 1986. It comprises 30 shares and its base year is 1978–79. The major criterion for selection of a scrip in the Sensex is large market capitalization. Besides this criterion, other criteria like listed history, track record, industry/sector representation, number of trades, average value of shares traded per day as a percentage of total number of outstanding shares, are considered for inclusion in the Sensex. The scrip selection is also based on a balanced representation of the industry, leadership position in the industry, continuous dividend-paying record, and track record of promoters. Since its beginning in 1986, it was revised for the first time on the 50th *Independence Day*, August 15, 1997, by replacing 15 scrips. During this revamp, the scrips of banks and financial institutions with a weightage of 14.6 per cent were included on the index for the first time. It was revised again in October 1998 to replace some old economy stocks such as Arvind Mills, Great Eastern Shipping, Steel Authority of India, and IPCL with some new economy stocks such as Infosys, NIIT, Castrol, and Novatris. The sensex was revamped again on March 11, 2000, which came into effect on April 10. Certain scrips, such as Indian Hotels, IDBI, Tata Chemicals, and Tata Power were replaced by Satyam Computers, Zee

#### **Major Indices**

- Sensex
- S&P CNX Nifty

Telefilms, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Reliance Petroleum. The new economy stocks had a 50 per cent weightage in the index. Today, only eight of the original club of 30 remain, the others have been supplanted by companies whose scrips are far more indicative of the happenings in the market.

The TCS has the highest weightage of 9.94 per cent in index market capitalization, followed by Reliance Industries with 8.15 per cent, and HDFC Bank with 7.92 per cent. The BSE Sensex represents 44 per cent of the BSE market capitalization and 14 most-important listed and traded sectors. The BSE Sensex scrips, on average, account for 52 per cent of the trading volumes on a daily basis and 35 per cent of total trades executed on the exchange.

Another index which has become very popular in a short span of time is the S&P CNX NIFTY. The NSE began equity trading in November 1994, and its volumes surpassed that of the BSE in a very short span of time. The NSE and CRISIL undertook a joint venture, wherein they jointly promoted India Index Services and Products, a specialized organization to provide stock index services. This organization developed scientifically devised indices of stock prices in the NSE in technical partnership with Standard and Poor (S&P). The NSE introduced this index to reflect the market movements more accurately, provide fund managers with a benchmark for measuring portfolio performance and develop a reference rate for introducing index-based derivative products. The S&P CNX Nifty launched on July 8, 1996, comprises 50 scrips which are selected on the basis of low impact cost, high liquidity and market capitalization. The impact cost is the percentage marking from the (bid + ask)/2 suffered in executing a transaction. The 'Bid' is the buyer's price—the price at which there is a ready buyer for the stock which he intends to sell. The 'Ask' (or offer) is the price at which there is a seller ready to sell his stock and this is the price the buyer needs to know when he is buying a stock.

Lower the impact cost, higher the liquidity of a stock and vice versa. Suppose a scrip trades at a bid price of  $\text{\textsterling}99$  and an asking price of  $\text{\textsterling}101$ , the ideal price is  $\text{\textsterling}100$ . If a buy order for 1,000 shares goes through at  $\overline{\tau}102$ , then the market impact cost is 2 per cent. If a buy order for 2,000 shares goes through at  $\overline{5104}$ , then the market impact cost at 2,000 shares is 4 per cent. For a stock to be included in the S&P CNX Nifty, it must trade in the total portfolio of  $\bar{\tau}2$  crores at an impact cost of less than 1.5 per cent on 85 per cent of the trading days. Nifty represents about 44 per cent of the total market capitalization on the NSE. The S&P CNX Nifty is a widely used indicator. Index funds and index futures and options, launched at the NSE, are based on the S&P CNX Nifty.

Both BSE as well as the NSE use the weighted average method of averaging whereby each stock is given a weight in proportion to its market capitalization. Suppose an index contains two stocks, A and B. If A has a market capitalization of  $\overline{\xi}3,000$  crores and B has a market capitalization of  $\overline{\xi}1,000$ crores, then a 75 per cent weightage is attached to the movements in A and a 25 per cent weightage to the movements in B.

Besides these two indices, the other popular indices are the Economic Times Ordinary Share Price Index, Financial Express Ordinary Price Index and the RBI Index of Security Prices. These indices comprise 72, 100, and 338 scrips, respectively. The major regional stock exchanges such as Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi and Ahmedabad have their own indices. The other major indices are the OTCEI index, the CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) index, the CRISIL CNX indices (mid-cap 200, PSE index, IT index and MNC index) and the Business Line (all India) Index.

## **Stock Exchanges**

## **The Bombay Stock Exchange**

Trading in securities has been in vogue in India for a little over 200 years. Trading in securities dates back to 1793, most of them being transactions in loan securities of the East India Company. Rampant speculation was a common feature even during those times. The broking community prospered as there was a rise in prices which led to a share mania during 1861–65. This bubble burst in 1865 when the American Civil War ended. The brokers realized that investor confidence in the securities market could be sustained only by organizing themselves into a regulated body with defined rules and regulations. This realization resulted in formation of 'The Native Share and Stock Brokers' Association,' which later came to be known as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). In 1875, these brokers assembled at a place now called Dalal Street. The BSE was set up as a voluntary, non-profitmaking association of broker members. It emerged as a premier stock exchange after the 1960s. The increased pace of industrialization caused by the two world wars, protection to the domestic industry and the government's fiscal policies aided the growth of new issues, which, in turn, helped the BSE

to prosper. The BSE dominated the Indian capital market by accounting for more than 60 per cent of the all-India turnover.

Until 1992, the BSE operated like a closed club of select members. With the securities scam outburst in 1992 and the SEBI taking over the reins of the stock market, the BSE had to bring about changes in its operational policies. Until March 1995, the BSE had an open outcry system of trading. However, when faced with a stiff competition from the NSE, the country's first modern, computerized and professionally managed stock exchange set up in 1994, the BSE had to change its system of trading and operations. On March 14, 1995, the BSE turned to electronic trading whereby the brokers trade using computers. This system is known as the BSE On-line Trading System (BOLT). Screen-based trading was initially confined to 818 major scrips. Trading in all the 5,000 scrips of the BSE was transferred to BOLT on July 3, 1995. The introduction of BOLT helped in improving trading volumes, significantly reducing the spread between buy-and-sell orders, better trading in odd-lot shares, fixed-income instruments and dealings in the renunciation of rights shares.

In 1995, BOLT was limited to Mumbai, whereas the NSE was operating at the national level. As a result, the BSE was losing countrywide business. The BSE, therefore, submitted a proposal for allowing the installation of terminals connected to BOLT in centres outside Mumbai. After rejecting the proposal four times, on October 29, 1996, the SEBI finally allowed the BSE to use its BOLT system nationwide.

Today, BOLT is spread over 330 cities with 15,471 TWSs (trader work stations). Later, the BSE set up a central depository system to dematerialize shares and promote demat trading.

The carry forward system, or *badla*, was a unique feature of Indian stock exchanges, particularly of the BSE. *Badla* was a unique selling proposition of the BSE. *Badla* provided the facility for carrying forward the transaction from one settlement to another. In simple terms, it was the postponement of the delivery of or payment for the purchase of securities from one settlement period to another. This facility of carry forward provided liquidity and breadth to the market. It was invented in the BSE and other exchanges copied the mechanism as it facilitated share financing, share lending, and carry forward simultaneously. It was a stock lending facility (since shares were needed to postpone a sell position) as well as a money market operation (since finance was needed to postpone a buy decision). By bringing in outside money to fund the carry forward of the long positions, *badla* acted as a bridge between the money market and the stock market. This system also helped in moderating extreme movement of stock prices, as it facilitated short selling in a rising market and long purchases in a declining market. It acted as a risk-hedging instrument wherein an investor could hedge against a likely fall or rise in prices by selling or buying in a carry forward market.

# *Badla* **Mechanism**

*Badla* was allowed in the specified group of shares of the BSE. This specified group was also known as the forward group as one could buy or sell shares in it without physical delivery. The carry forward session (*badla* session) was held on every Saturday at the BSE.

A contract for current settlement could be executed in any of the following three ways:

- Delivery against a sale contract given and delivery against a purchase contract received, and payment received/made at the contract rate.
- Squaring off of transactions wherein a reverse transaction of either buying or selling of shares squared up with the earlier outstanding position and the difference in prices settled.
- A contract in respect of which delivery was given or taken and which was not offset by an opposite transaction during the settlement period, could be carried forward to the next settlement period at the making up price, *i.e.*, the closing quotation on the last trading day and the difference between the contract rate and the making up price settled. This postponement of the delivery of or payment for the purchase of securities from one settlement period to another was referred to as carry forward.

*Badla* involved four parties: the long buyer—a buy position in a stock without the capacity to take delivery of the same, the short seller—a sell position without having the delivery in hand, the financier and the stock lender.

If the quantum of delivery sales exceeded the quantum of delivery purchases, financiers known as *vyaj badlawala* came forward to assist in completing the deal, took delivery in the current settlement, made the delivery in the next settlement to the buyers and, by doing so, helped in carrying forward the transaction. The difference between the current settlement rate and the sale rate for the next settlement which they received was the interest charges known as *seedha badla* and the transaction was known as *vyaj* or *mandi badla*. If the quantum of delivery purchases exceeded the quantum of delivery sales, share financiers known as *teji badlawala* would give delivery in the current settlement to the buyers at the settlement rate and take the delivery back in the next settlement from the seller at lower sale rates. The difference between the two rates earned by them was known as 'backwardation' or *ulta badla* and the transaction was known as *mal badla* or *teji badla*.

*Badla* charges were market-determined and varied from scrip to scrip and from settlement to settlement. *Badla* rates ranged from 15 per cent to 36 per cent on a yearly basis. The SEBI banned *badla* charges for carry forward sales (short position) if the net carry forward buy (long) positions exceeded short positions. If the market was overbought (net long), there would be more demand for funds and the carry forward rates would be high; the reverse would be true when the market was oversold (net short). An oversold market would result in high demand for securities and the stock lender would get returns.

These transactions were completely hedged and stock exchanges guaranteed settlements and conducted auctions of shares in case of defaults. However, these guarantees were not available in unofficial or parallel *badla* markets which existed in Kolkata and Mumbai. Kolkata had a 90 per cent unofficial *badla* market and as a result, it had to undergo a payment crisis in 2001.

*Badla,* or the carry forward facility, was quite popular, accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the trade at all stock exchanges.

# **Advantages**

The *badla* system contributed to the increase in the volume of the trading activity at the BSE as it facilitated brokers to carry forward their positions and leverage. Moreover, as *badla* financiers were earning higher returns through this mechanism, they were lending a larger amount of funds, leading to an increase in trading activity. *Badla* along with other factors such as increased network, boom periods, and increased participation by retail investors was instrumental in the increase of volume of trading activity from `500 crore in 1991–92 to `9,000 crore in 2000. *Badla* was also a vehicle of speculation.

The 135-year-old *badla* system was banned in 1993 by the SEBI as it led to excessive speculation and increased market risk. It was also uncontrolled and unregulated which enhanced market risk and the prices of scrips could be manipulated under *badla* as brokers could easily corner liquid stocks. Moreover, brokers evaded margins and manipulated *badla* rates. Following the ban, however there was a steep decline in the volumes in the specified group following the ban. Therefore, it was revived and resumed again on the BSE in January 1996 on the recommendations of the G. S. Patel Committee. Later, in March 1997, the SEBI constituted the J. R. Varma Committee to review the revised carry forward system. The committee recommended a modified carry forward system (MCFS) which was accepted by the SEBI.

The MCFS was replaced by another carry forward mechanism—Borrowing and Lending of Securities Scheme (BLESS)—on January 27, 2001. This scheme was similar to Automatic Lending and Borrowing Mechanism (ALBM) of the NSE. The difference between ALBM/BLESS and *badla* was that while under ALBM/ BLESS one could withdraw the securities financed by paying a small margin of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, under *badla,* securities were kept with the clearing house and could not be withdrawn. Due to the facility of withdrawal of securities under BLESS/ALBM, a broker could create an exposure seven to eight times the amount invested in these deferral products.

In March 2001, after the Ketan Parekh scam came to light and the payment crisis in the Kolkata Stock Exchange, the SEBI completely banned *badla* and all deferral products—ALBM and BLESS—from July 2001. With this ban again, the volume of trading on BSE slumped from an average daily turnover of `5,220 crore in May 2001 to around `700 crore in July 2001—a decline of more than 70 per cent in a period of two months. This old system has been replaced by a new system—rolling settlement.

# **Listing Categories**

Before *badla* was resumed in 1996, there were only two categories of securities listed on the BSE—the specified group of shares comprising the securities in which carry forward deals were allowed and the cash group shares in which no carry forward deals were permitted. Later, it was observed that the facility **Types of** *Badla* **Transactions**

*Vyaj badla* known as *mandi badla. Teji badla* known as *mal badla.*

of carry forward was not being used in all the 94 scrips in the specified group. Hence, after *badla* was resumed, the size of the specified group was reduced to 32 scrips on April 3, 1996.

The BSE later decided to regroup the existing A and B group shares into three categories.

**A Group** This group consists of large turnover and high floating stock, with large market capitalization. In other words, scrips included in this group are blue-chip companies. Carry-forward deals and weekly settlement were allowed in this group. At present, there are 150 scrips in this group.

**B1 Group** This group includes scrips of quality companies with an equity above  $\overline{\mathfrak{g}}_3$  crores, with high growth potential and trading frequency. No carry-forward facility was allowed in this group.

**B2 Group** This group of scrips were just like those of B1 but with a fortnightly settlement. However, in September 1996, the BSE introduced a weekly settlement for all scrips listed on the exchange, thus doing away with the distinction between the B1 and B2 groups. This group consists of low trading volume scrips, with an equity below  $\overline{\ell}3$  crores, and surveillance measures initiated against most of them for suspected price manipulations.

Both B1 and B2 groups have been merged into one group known as B Group since April 1, 2008. All companies not included in group 'A', 'S' or 'Z' are clubbed under this category.

Subsequently, a Z group was introduced in 1999 with scrips of companies that do not meet the rules, regulations and stipulations laid down by the exchange. It is a buyer-beware company. There are some 300 scrips in the group. The companies that failed on a frequent basis to disclose quarterly results, to address investor grievances and make an arrangement with depositories to demat shares or even pay the exchange-listing fees are transferred by the exchange to this category. All Z-category stocks result in deliveries. The trading is on a trade-to-trade basis and no squaring up is permitted in intra-day trading as in other groups. The exchange authorities review their performance on a regular basis; and if a company satisfies the requirement, it is reverted back to its original group.

A new F group pertaining to the debt-market segment and G group pertaining to the governmentsecurities market was started with effect from September 9, 1996.

The BSE set up the BSE INDONext market as a separate trading market on January 7, 2005 on its BOLT system as S group.

The scrips are transferred on a trade-to-trade basis from the regular segment to T group. Settlement of trades is done on the basis of gross obligations for the day. No netting is allowed and every trade is settled separately.

Scrips in the BSE-Indonext segment S, which are settled on a trade-to-trade basis as a surveillance measure, are transferred to the **TS** group.

There were 5,834 companies were listed on BSE till March 31, 2017.

## **BSE Indices**

The first index launched by BSE was the BSE Sensitive Index (Sensex) in 1986. Since then, in the last 15 years, it has launche d 13 more indices. The BSE Sensex of equity-share prices was launched with the base year of 1978–79. It comprises 30 scrips. The BSE Sensex was followed by the BSE National in 1989.

This is a broader index comprising 100 scrips. The BSE introduced two new indices during 1993–94 the BSE 200 and the Dollex. The BSE 200 reflects the movements in the shares of 200 selected companies from its specified and non-specified lists. The Dollex is a dollar version of the BSE 200, which has 1989–90 as its base year. The BSE Dollex indices are Dollex 30, 100 and 200. The BSE introduced five sectoral indices from August 1999—the BSE IT Index, the BSE Capital Goods Index, the BSE FMCG Index, the BSE Health Care Index and the BSE Consumer Durables Index. In 2001, the BSE launched the BSE-PSU Index Dollex-30 and the BSE-Tech Index. Market capitalization of all the indices is a free-float market capitalization except for BSE-PSU Index. Subsequently, it introduced seven new sectoral indices which include auto, bank, metal, oil and gas, power, realty and tech. The other major indices introduced are small cap, midcap, BSE100, BSE 500 and BSE IPO. From June 2017, Differential Voting Rights (DVRs) are eligible for index inclusion provided that the ordinary share class is part of the index and the DVR shares outstanding are greater than 10% of the ordinary shares outstanding. In addition, the DVRs must individually satisfy all other index eligibility criteria. DVRs satisfying the index eligibility criteria are aggregated with the company's common stock and index construction is done based on the aggregated company data.

**Bull Rally** The first bull rally was witnessed in 1992 when the reforms were announced in the Manmohan Singh Budgets. The sensex climbed from 1017.72 on January 17, 1991 to a peak of 4467.32 on April 23, 1992. On October 17, 2003, the BSE Sensex closed at 4,930.53. This was the fastest rally of 2,006 points in the last decade. This 2,006-point rally came in 123 trading days, since April 25, 2003, when the Sensex was 2,924.12 points. However, the fastest rally, outside the current decade, was during the Harshad Mehta Scam when the Sensex gained 2,193 points in 31 trading days between February 7, and April 2, 1992. The biggest bull run was inspired by 'Big Bull' Harshad Mehta and expectations of foreign money coming into the local equity market. The Sensex moved up by 127 per cent from 1,885 to 4,285 levels.

The second 1,150-plus point rally during March–August 2003 in the equity market was the largest halfyear rally in more than a decade. The BSE Sensex then registered the biggest post-reform gain—a record rise of 83.37 per cent during the year 2003–04. Unlike some previous rallies, this rally was a broad-based one, not driven by a few scrips of one or two sectors. Investors holding a diversified portfolio recorded an all-round gain. Moreover, there was also a considerable amount of FII interest in the Indian markets.

Between the last week of October 2004 and end-March 2005, a strong rally pushed the BSE Sensex to a historic high of 6,915.06 on March 8, 2005. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, renewed buying interests by FIIs, an acceleration in the industrial activity, an improved financial performance of Indian companies, a moderation of domestic inflation, an easing of international crude-oil prices, an unprecedented pick-upon in bank credit and policy initiatives relating to the FDI in telecom and construction sections contributed to the upsurge in the Sensex.

The Sensex crossed the 8,000 level—a historic high on September 8, 2005. The Sensex closed on that day at 8,053—a rise of 106 points. The BSE Sensex crossed the 5-digit mark on February 6, 2006 when it touched 10,122. It touched 12,000 on April 20, 2006 and 12,671 on May 11, 2006, but it went into a free fall after May 12, 2006, lost 30 per cent over a month, touched bottom at 8,799 on June 14, 2006 and drove investors into a panic.

The Sensex touched 11,015 on August 8, 2006 and 12,010 on September 15, 2006. It crossed the 13,000 mark on October 30, 2006 when the index rallied 117 points to close at 13,024. Investors' wealth in the 30 Sensex companies, measured in terms of the cumulative market value of these firms, soared to over  $\bar{\mathcal{F}}16,50,000$  crores, from about  $\bar{\mathcal{F}}15,00,000$  crores on April 20, 2006. Total investor wealth soared to over 34,00,000 crores on October 30, 2006. Strong economic growth, robust corporate results, a stable rupee, inflation and interest rates, lower crude-oil prices and high FII investment gave a fillip to market sentiments which drove the Sensex to amazing heights.

In 2006, the Sensex joined a select club of global indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng which had crossed the 10,000 mark. India became the first BRIC country to join an exclusive club of developed markets whose market capitalization of companies listed on the stock exchanges exceeds the GDP. A comparison of the market capitalization with GDP is primarily made to assess the valuation levels of the markets. The total listed market capitalization touched  $\overline{3}34$  lakh crores on October 16, 2006 exceeding the GDP figure of around  $\overline{32}$  lakh crores during the financial year 2006.

The Sensex touched an all-time high of 21,206.77 on January 10, 2008, but then started declining on account of adverse global developments. The Sensex rose on account of improvements in the global financial markets scenario during 2009–10 and 2010–11.

The Sensex crossed 32,000 mark in September 2017.

## **Conclusion**

The oldest stock exchange of India faced rough weather when the National Stock Exchange (NSE) was set up in 1994. It was opined that the BSE would not be in a position to face stiff competition from this new and modern stock exchange. However, the BSE revamped its operations quickly, adopted modern technology, and gave tough competition to the NSE. This competition among the exchanges has made the Indian capital market more mature.

The BSE is still in the process of reforming itself. The involvement of BSE brokers and its elected members in a series of scams has affected its image and small and institutional investors have more or less lost faith in it. It completed the process of demutualization and corporatization in May 2007. The Singapore stock exchange (SGX) and the Deutsche Borse (DB) are BSE's strategic partners holding 5 per cent stake each in the exchange. They have a combined investment of  $\overline{380}$  crore at  $\overline{5200}$  per share.

The BSE's network outside Mumbai has not expanded significantly. The BSE lacks in liquidity and needs to draw in more players like market makers to create liquidity. The BSE and NSE had commenced derivatives trading in 2000 but NSE dominates the derivatives market. The oldest stock exchange in order to regain a competitive edge over NSE, it reformulated its strategies and effectively implemented them to
recover its lost market share. BSE is slowly surging ahead by gaining substantial market share both in the cash segment and especially in the derivatives segment.

## **The National Stock Exchange Of India**

The stock markets witnessed many institutional changes in the 1990s. One of them was the establishment of the NSE, a modern stock exchange which brought with it the best global practices.

The NSE was incorporated in November 1992 with the following objectives:

- To establish a nationwide trading facility for equities, debt instruments, and hybrids.
- To ensure all investors all over the country equal access through an appropriate communication network.
- To provide a fair, efficient, and transparent securities market to investors through an electronic trading system.
- To enable shorter settlement cycles and book-entry settlement system.
- To meet the current international standards of securities markets.

The Pherwani Committee, which mooted the setting up of the NSE, wanted different trading floors linked through a technologically backed, automated network thereby creating an exchange with a national network. However, instead of providing a common platform for all regional stock exchanges, the NSE is competing with the BSE, thus creating a problem of survival for other exchanges.

The NSE, unlike other Indian stock exchanges, is a tax-paying company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. It has been promoted by leading financial institutions and banks to provide automated and modern facilities for trading, clearing and settlement of securities in a transparent, fair and open manner and with countrywide access.

The exchange is professionally managed in that the ownership and the management of the NSE are completely separated from the right to trade on the exchange. In order to upgrade the professional standards of the market intermediaries, the exchange lays stress on factors such as capital adequacy, corporate structure, track record and educational experience.

NSE's membership is always on tap and anyone who meets the eligibility criteria such as cash deposits and high net worth can become a member. A member, who wants to quit business, can do so freely and refund deposits after meeting all liabilities.

NSE members are connected to the Exchange from their work stations to the central computer located at the exchange through a satellite using VSATs (very small aperture terminals). The NSE has installed over 2,648 VSATs in over 201 cities across the country. Members can place orders from their office and extend connectivity to clients through their computer-to-computer-link (CTCL) facility outside their premises. Registered dealers of the members have remote trading terminals at their offices and they trade electronically on the 'NSE–NEAT' trading system through the CTCL server installed at the members' office. Through this facility, members can have a total control over their network and can closely monitor the orders placed by their registered dealers/branches.

The NSE was granted recognition as a stock exchange in April 1993 and it started operations with the wholesale debt market (WDM) segment in June 1994. It started equity trading in November 1994 and, in a short span of 1 year, surpassed the volume at the BSE, the largest stock exchange in the country. The NSE is the only stock exchange in the world to get to the first place in the country in the very first year of its operations.

The NSE offers a trading platform for a wide range of products for multiple markets, including equity shares; warrants; exchange-traded funds (ETF); mutual funds; debt instruments including corporate debt, central and state government securities, treasury bills, commercial paper and certificate of deposits; derivatives like index futures and options, stock futures and options and currency futures. The Exchange provides trading in four different segments, namely, Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment, Capital Market (CM) segment, Futures & Options (F&O) segment and the Currency Derivatives (CD) segment.

There are more than 1,800 companies listed on the NSE and more than 95 per cent of these are actively traded.

The NSE introduced, for the first time in India, fully automated, screen-based trading, eliminating the need for physicaltrading floors. This screen-based trading was the first to go live in the world through satellite communication.

The NSE developed a system of managing the primary issues through screen-based automated trading system.

The NSE offers its nationwide network for conducting online IPOs through the book-building process. It operates a fully automated, screen-based, bidding system called NEAT IPO that enables the trading members to enter bids directly from their offices through a sophisticated telecommunication network.

The NSE developed a new trading application, NOW, or 'NEAT on Web' in May 2008. This platform allows the trading members to connect to the Exchange through the Internet, and has resulted in a significant reduction in both access cost as well as turnaround time for providing access.

The NSE is the first stock exchange to help promote institutional infrastructure of the capital market.

NSE offers more than 10 asset classes and has taken initiatives to strengthen the securities industry by providing several new products like Mini Nifty, long dated options and mutual fund service system. It has introduced services like DMA, FIX capabilities co-location facility and mobile trading to cater to the evolving needs of the market and participants. NSE has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Singapore Exchange (SGX) to cooperate in the development of a market for market linked products and services to be listed on SGX.

In 1995, the NSE set up the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL)—the first clearing corporation in the country, to provide settlement guarantee. To promote dematerialization of securities, it jointly set up with the erstwhile UTI and the IDBI, the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)—the first depository in India.

The NSE set up India Index Services and Products Limited (IISL), a joint venture of CRISIL and NSE, in May 1998, to provide indices and index services. IISL is India's first specialized company focusing upon the index as a core product and maintains over 96 equity indices comprising broad-based, benchmark indices, sectoral indices and customized indices.

The NSE's IT set-up is larger than that of any company in the country. It has a state-of-the-art clientserver application. The NSE was the first exchange to grant permission to brokers for Internet trading. The NSE incorporated a separate entity—NSE IT Ltd in October 1999, to service the securities industry in addition to the management of IT requirements of the NSE. It also set up NSE Infotech Services Ltd to focus on IT. It caters to the IT needs of NSE and all its group companies exclusively. The data and info-vending products of the NSE are provided through a separate company DotEx International Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the NSE. DotEX also offers 'NOW' a fully managed, secure and reliable trading gateway, providing immediate, scalable and seamless access through internet to members and internet investors

The commodity exchange platform—NCDEX—was jointly set up by the NSE with financial institutions. In order to provide clearing-and-settlement services to NCDEX, it promoted a company—National Commodity Clearing Limited (NCCL) in 2006. The clearing and settlement covers contracts in 44 products ranging from agricultural commodities to base metals, energy, polymers and precious metals. In 2008, it set up a national-level electricity exchange—Power Exchange India (PXI) Ltd, again the first of its kind in the country.

The NSE is ranked third in terms of number of equity shares traded and is the eighth largest derivatives exchange in the world.

# **Membership Pattern on the NSE**

The management of the NSE is in the hands of professionals, as distinct from the trading members, to avoid any conflict of interest. If the applicant is an individual/partnership firm/corporate, then the individual/at least two partners of the applicant firm/at least two directors of the applicant corporate must be graduates, possess at least 2-year experience in securities market, not debarred by the SEBI and not engaged in any fund-based activity. A trading member is admitted to any of the following combinations of market segments: (a) wholesale debt market (WDM) segment, (b) capital market (CM) and the futures and options (F&O) segments, (c) CM segment and the WDM segment or (d) all the three segments.

# **Indices**

The NSE Fifty was rechristened as the S&P CNX Nifty on July 28, 1998. This index is widely used as it reflects the state of the market sentiments for 50 highly liquid scrips. The base period for the S&P CNX Nifty is November 3, 1995. The S&P CNX Nifty is computed using a float-adjusted, market capitalization-weighted methodology. It accounts for 58.64 per cent of the total market capitalization of CM segment of NSE and 51.39 per cent of the traded value of all the stocks on the NSE as at end-March 2008. It is used as a benchmarking fund portfolios, index-based derivatives and index funds.

The CNX Nifty Junior is a mid-cap index introduced in January 1997 to cater to the growth companies in the economy. The base period is November 3, 1996. Companies include those which are traded with an impact cost of less than 2.5 per cent on 85 per cent of the trading days. It accounts for 9.60 per cent of the market capitalization of CM segment of NSE as at end-March 2008.

A new index called the S&P CNX Defty (dollar-denominated S&P CNX Nifty) was introduced on November 26, 1997. It shows returns on the S&P CNX Nifty index in dollar terms. The S&P CNX Defty serves as a performance indicator to FIIs, offshore funds and others. It is also used as an effective tool for hedging Indian equity exposure. This new index is available online.

The other popular indices are the Nifty mid-cap 50, the CNX mid-cap 50, the S&P CNX Sectoral Indices, such as IT, Bank, FMCG, Public Sector Enterprises (PSE), MNC, Services, Energy, Pharma, Infrastructure, PSU Bank, Realty, Petrochemicals and services.

NSE launched on January 29, 2008 an environment, social and corporate governing (ESG) index, the first of its kind, to measure practices based on quantitative as opposed to subjective factors.

These indices are maintained, monitored and updated by India Index Services and Products Limited (IISL). A joint venture between the NSE and CRISIL, IISL is the only specialized organization in the country to provide stock-index services. It introduced the country's first infotech, sector-specific index in September 1998.

# **National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited**

In April 1995, the NSE set up the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL), a wholly owned subsidiary, to undertake clearing and settlement at the exchange. It commenced operations from April 1996. It operates with a well-defined settlement cycle, aggregates trades over a trading period, nets the positions to determine the liabilities of the members, and ensures movement of funds and securities to meet respective liabilities. Its central functions are clearing and settlement of trades and risk management.

It was set up with the following objectives:

- to bring and sustain confidence in clearing and settlement of securities;
- to promote and maintain, short and consistent settlement cycles;
- to provide counter-party risk guarantee, and
- to operate a tight risk containment system.

#### **Functions of NSCCL**

- Clears all trades
- Determines obligations of members
- Arranges for pay-in and pay-out of funds/ securities
- Receives funds/ securities
- Processes for shortages in funds/ securities
- Guarantees settlement
- Collects and maintains margins/collateral/ base capital/other funds
- Counter party to all settlement obligations of the members

The NSCCL assumes the counter-party risk of each member and guarantees settlement. Settlement guarantee is a guarantee provided by the clearing corporation for the settlement of all trades even if a party defaults to deliver securities or pay cash. The NSCCL started the settlement guarantee fund for the capital market in June 1996 with an initial corpus of  $\bar{\tau}$ 300 crore. This fund stood at  $\bar{\tau}$ 2,700 crore at the end of March 2006. It cushions itself from any residual risk. Members contribute to this fund which is utilized for the successful completion of settlement. A separate settlement guarantee fund (SGF) is maintained for the futures and options (F&O) segment.

There are four entities linked with the Clearing Corporation (NSCCL) in the clearing and settlement process.

![](2__page_34_Figure_3.jpeg)

- **Custodian/Clearing members:** Clearing members have to make available funds and/or securities in the designated accounts with clearing bank/depositories to meet their obligations on the settlement date. Custodian is a clearing member but not a trading member. They settle trades assigned to them by trading members. The NSCCL notifies the relevant trade details to custodians on the trade day who affirm back. If a custodian confirms to settle that trade, he is assigned that particular obligation by the NSCCL. There are 19 custodians empanelled with the NSCCL.
- **Clearing banks:** They are a key link between the clearing members and clearing corporation. Every clearing member is required to open a dedicated clearing account with one of the designated clearing banks. The NSCCL, in association with clearing banks, provides working capital funding to clearing members. A clearing bank has to enter into an agreement with the NSCCL and the clearing member and open clearing accounts with depositories. The clearing member has to approach its bank, which would extend the funding requirements in consultation with the NSCCL.
- **Depositories:** They hold securities in dematerialized form for the investors in their beneficiary accounts. Every clearing member is required to maintain a clearing pool account with the depositories. The depository runs on electronic file to transfer securities from accounts of the custodians/ clearing member to that of the NSCCL and vice versa.
- **Professional Clearing Members (PCMs):** They are a special category of members with clearing rights but with no trading rights and who perform functions similar to those of custodians. PCMs clear and settle trade for their clients who may be individuals or institutions.

The NSCCL carries out the clearing and settlement process with the help of clearing banks and depositories which results in an actual movement of funds and securities on the prescribed pay-in and pay-out day.

The clearing members bring in the securities in designated accounts with the two depositories—the CM pool account in the case of the NSDL and designated settlement accounts in the case of the CDSL and funds in the designated accounts with clearing banks. The clearing banks, on receiving electronic instructions from the NSCCL, debit accounts of clearing banks and credit accounts of the clearing corporation. This is termed as pay-in of funds and securities.

The NSCCL, after providing for shortages of funds/securities, sends electronic instructions to the depositors/clearing banks to credit accounts of clearing members and debit accounts of the clearing corporation. Thus, the settlement cycle is complete once the pay-out of funds and securities is done.

# **Margin Requirements**

The NSCCL imposes stringent margin requirements as part of its risk containment measures. For imposing margins, the stocks are categorized as follows:

- The stocks, which have traded atleast 80 per cent of the days during the previous 18 months, shall constitute Group I and Group II.
- Out of the scrips identified above, those having a mean impact cost of less than or equal to one per cent shall be under Group I and the scrips where the impact cost is more than one, shall be under Group II.

## **NSCCL Products and Services**

- Clearing and settlement
- Guarantee
- Risk management
- Direct payment to clients
- Constituent SGL account
- Mutual fund service system

- The remaining stocks shall be under Group III.
- The impact cost shall be calculated on the 15th of each month on a rolling basis considering the order book snapshots of the previous six months. On the basis of the calculated impact cost, the scrip shall move from one group to another group from the 1st of the next month. The impact cost is required to be calculated for an order value of  $\bar{\tau}$ 1 lakh.

The daily margin is the the sum of mark to market margin (MTM margin) and value at risk-based margin (VaR-based margin). The VaR margin is applicable for all securities in rolling settlement.

For the securities listed in Group I, scripwise daily volatility is calculated using the exponentially weighted moving average which is 3.5 times the volatility. For the securities listed in Group II, the VaR margin is higher of scrip VaR  $(3.5 \delta)$  or three times the index VaR and it is scaled up by root 3. For the securities listed in Group III, the VaR margin is equal to five times the index VaR and scaled up by square root of 3. The VaR margin rate for a security constitute the following:

- The index VaR would be the higher of the daily Index VaR based on the S&P CNX Nifty or the BSE Sensex. The index VaR would be subject to a minimum of 5 per cent.
- An additional VaR margin of 6 per cent as specified by the SEBI.
- The NSCCL may stipulate security specific margins for the securities from time to time.

The mark to market margin is calculated on the basis of a notional loss which the member would incur in case the cumulative net outstanding position of the member in all securities, at the end of the relevant day were closed out at the closing price of the securities as announced at the end of the day by the NSE. Mark to market margin is calculated by marking each transaction in a scrip to the closing price of the scrip at the end of trading. In case the security has not been traded on a particular day, the latest available closing price at the NSE is considered as the closing price. In the event of the net outstanding position of a member in any security being nil, the difference between the buy and sell values would be considered as notional loss for the purpose of calculating the mark to market margin payable. MTM profit/loss across different securities within the same settlement is set off to determine the MTM less for a settlement. Such MTM losses for settlements are computed at client level.

The NSCCL has introduced the facility of direct payment to clients' account on both the depositories—the NSDL and the CDSL. Based on the information received from members, the NSCCL sends pay-out instructions to the depositories which enables the clients to receive the pay-out directly into their accounts on pay-out day.

The NSCCL also offers constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) facilities to investors in government securities. SGL is a facility provided by the RBI to large banks and financial institutions to hold their investments in government securities in the electronic book entry form. The securities held in SGL can be settled through a delivery-versus payment (DVP) mechanism which ensures simultaneous movement of funds and securities.

Mutual Fund Service System (MFSS) is a facility provided by the NSCCL to investors for transacting in dematerialized units of open-ended schemes of mutual funds. The objective is to provide to the investor a one-stop shop for transacting in financial products. MFSS addresses the need for a common platform for sale and repurchase of units of schemes managed by various funds. The exchange, with its extensive network covering around 400 cities and towns across the country, offers a mechanism for electronic online collection of orders from the market and the Clearing Corporation acts as a central agency for the clearing and settlement of all orders. The transactions are not covered by settlement guarantee.

The NSCCL was permitted to operate a stock lending/borrowing scheme from July 1998. The NSE and the NSCCL commenced the automated lending and borrowing mechanism (ALBM) for lending and borrowing of securities from February 10, 1999. The ALBM facilitated borrowing/lending of securities/ funds at market-determined rates to meet immediate settlement requirements or payment obligations at a reasonable cost and low risk. The ALBM was NSE's answer to BSE's *badla.* The ALBM was restricted to only the S&P CNX Nifty and the CNX Nifty Junior Index securities. *Badla* was supposed to be a pure financing mechanism while ALBM was a security lending and borrowing mechanism. The trades in the ALBM segment were guaranteed by the settlement fund of the NSE. This deferral product has been banned by the SEBI along with other deferral products from July 2001.

# **Capital Market Segment of the NSE**

The capital market segment, which covers trading in equities, commenced trading on November 3, 1994. NSE adopted the order-driven trading system as opposed to a quote-driven system. The order-driven system helped reduce jobbing spreads to cut down transaction costs.

| <b>NSE</b>                       | <b>Market</b><br><b>Share</b><br>(per<br>cent) |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|                                  |                                                |
| Segment                          | $2015 - 16$                                    |
| Capital<br>market                | 84                                             |
| <b>Futures</b><br>and<br>options | 73                                             |
| Currency<br>Derivatives          | 54                                             |

As on March 31, 2013, there were 1,666 listed companies on NSE. On an average, 85 per cent of their stocks are traded every day. The exchange covers 90 per cent of all-India market capitalization.

Trading volumes increased tremendously during the years 1994–95 to 2000–01. A major reason for this growth was the nationwide reach of the NSE. The superior technology of the NSE enabled an investor in a remote part of the country to trade safely. The liquidity in the NSE market was not limited to highmarket capitalization stocks, but was found in other mid- and low-capitalization stocks as well. Trading volumes declined in 2001–02, but again, picked up in the first quarter of 2002–03. There was a strong buying interest in mid-cap technology stocks, in PSU scrips following acceleration of the disinvestment programme and in banking scrips due to their improved performance and relaxation in FDI limits. The market capitalization of listed companies depicts a rising trend except in the year 2000–01 due to a decline in the market prices of IT stocks.

On June 4, 2007, the S&P CNX Nifty Index scaled to a peak of 4362.95 and the market capitalization of the scrips was a record high of  $\overline{39,78,381}$  crores on June 29, 2007. The secondary market was buoyant during 2005–06 and 2006–07 on account of earnings growth reported by Corporates, relaxation in fringe benefit tax (FBT) treating open-ended and close-ended equity or oriented schemes on par for dividend distribution tax, strong macro-economic fundamentals, raising FII limit in debt market and favourable global economic environment. The Nifty declined to 3,021 in 2008–09 on account of global economic crisis but with an improvement in global economic scenario increased to 5,249 in 2009–10 and 5,834 in 2010–11. 2010–11. During September 2017, the Nifty rose to a level of 10,000 with an improvement in the macro-economic conditions.

## **Conclusion**

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) completed 23 years of operations on June 30, 2017. The exchange is credited with technology innovation, speeding up of the process for dematerialization, introduction of effective risk containment measures and the introduction of derivatives trading. It has spread to 364 cities using close to 3900 VSATs. It is a dominant stock exchange accounting for 84 per cent of the traded volume in the cash segment and 74 per cent of the traded volume in the derivatives segment.

The NSE has emerged as a technology-driven stock exchange. It has rightly positioned itself as 'the exchange with a difference'. In order to maintain its leading position among exchanges, it increases the number of users by trying to meet their growing and ever changing types of needs through innovative efforts. Its aim is to continuously upgrade technology systems and trading practices. The setting up of the NSE has changed the face of the Indian stock market. The NSE won the inaugural Wharton-Infosys Business Transformation Award in the 'organization-wide transformation' category for Europe and the Asia-Pacific region for harnessing technology to create a world class exchange and using it as an instrument of change for the industry as a whole. The NSE was the third largest exchange in the world in 2005 in terms of the number of transactions.

It received the Asian Banker Achievement Awards 2015 for the best Stock Exchange of the year.

# **Regional Stock Exchanges**

One significant aspect of the Indian capital market is the existence of as many as 19 regional stock exchanges—the highest in the world. RSEs existed in developed markets also but ultimately, they had to shut down or merge with the principal exchanges. Over 20 stock exchanges existed in the UK until 1973. By 1965, the regional exchanges joined together to form the Federation of Stock Exchanges and amalgamated to become a fully unified stock exchange in 1973.

Australia had six exchanges which got together and established the Australia Associated Stock Exchanges (AASE), a company limited by its guarantee, to represent them at the national level. In 1987, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) commenced operation, with the six capital city exchanges as its wholly owned subsidiaries. In Italy, all securities listed on the Milan Stock Exchange and nine other RSEs were transferred to a national computerized order-driven trading system under the Italian Stock Exchange in 1991. Today, the Italian stock market is a computerized system which has no specific location.

In India, the area of operation and jurisdiction of the regional stock exchanges were specified. The emergence of a number of regional stock exchanges was the result of India's geographical and telecommunications limitations.

These regional stock exchanges provided investors an access to big brokers in Mumbai. They also served as a link between the local companies and local investors. Reputed local companies could get themselves listed on these exchanges and the regional stock exchanges promoted trading in these local scrips. This led to a competition among issuers and they listed their securities on as many exchanges as possible to attract investors from all over the country. Moreover, each regional stock exchange followed its own practice and procedures in respect of listing and trading of securities, clearing and settlement of transactions, and risk containment measures. This resulted in a waste of the resources of the issuers for complying with the listing requirement of a number of exchanges simultaneously. Again, competition amongst exchanges increased to attract as many issuers as possible. The listing fees constitutes a major source of income and to maintain these fees, listing standards were diluted. The regional stock exchanges did well till the beginning of the 1990s.

In the 1990s, new stock exchanges—the Over the Counter Exchange of India, the National Stock Exchange, and the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange of India—were set up and permitted nationwide trading. Subsequently, all stock exchanges were permitted to expand across the nation. Inspite of this expansion, the turnover did not increase because with the spread of online trading, traders in remote parts of the country could deal directly with the NSE or the BSE. Hence, there was no need to go through regional exchanges. Besides this, members of these regional stock exchanges involved themselves in speculation instead of reaching out to new investors and catering to local companies in an efficient manner. With turnovers plunging, most RSEs acquired membership of the BSE or the NSE and became their stockbrokers.

Many large companies decided to delist on all stock exchanges except the BSE and the NSE. Since listing fees constitutes the major source of income, the question of viability of these stock exchanges arose. Apart from listing fees, another source of income for stock exchanges is interest and rent. These stock exchanges receive custodial deposits for risk management and earn interest on them. Despite increase in the interest income, most of the stock exchanges incurred losses.

The daily turnover at the Delhi Stock Exchange plunged to  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore in 2002. Stock exchanges such as Guwahati, Cochin, Jaipur, Bhubaneshwar, Mangalore, Madhya Pradesh, and Magadh had an almost negligible turnover. There was insignificant or no trading at all in these stock exchanges. The percentage of turnover on regional stock exchanges was around 1.1 per cent in 2003–04.

In 2001–02, the NSE commanded around 80 per cent of the turnover, while the BSE accounted for 16 per cent only. The regional stock exchanges together accounted for the remaining 4 per cent of the total turnover.

The share of the RSEs came down to a meagre 1 per cent in 2004–05, 0.19 per cent in 2005–06 and 0.01 per cent in 2008–09. The Mangalore Stock Exchange was not given recognition by the SEBI in 2004–05. The Magadh, Hyderbad and Saurashta-Kutch ((SKSE) stock exchanges have been derecognized by the SEBI. After the derecognition, the stock exchange might continue as a corporate entity but cannot use the expression 'stock exchange' or any variant of this in its name or its subsidiary's name.

There was hardly any transaction in the 13 out of the 15 regional stock exchanges during 2008–09. With a significant decline in the trading at the RSEs, they set up subsidiaries; and these subsidiaries acquired access to national exchanges at concessional rates. Some of the subsidiaries are profitmaking entities providing securities trading, depository participant services and distribution of mutual funds.

The RSEs were needed when there was no electronic trading. With the NSE and the BSE offering nationwide, screen-based trading, the question has arisen whether the RSEs are needed at all.

Looking at this scenario, it seems that, in the long run, there will be only two stock exchanges in India: the NSE and the BSE. The lead that the NSE has gained over the BSE will increase in the coming years as the NSE is perceived to be more investor-friendly than the BSE by most investors. The RSEs will be forced to down their shutters as low turnover volumes will result in huge revenue deficits. Moreover, most of the stock exchanges do not have the money to upgrade their IT infrastructure, a prerequisite to survive and compete in the future.

With a view to reviving the regional stock exchanges, the SEBI allowed the outside investors to invest in them. It allowed single-entity holding up to 15 per cent in the stock exchanges. The government has allowed foreign direct and portfolio investors to buy into the equity of stock exchanges with a limit of 49 per cent. However, despite the outside investors' investment, these stock exchanges have not yet managed to restart operations.

There are seven stock exchanges in India, of which four—BSE, NSE, Calcutta Stock Exchange and Ahmedabad Stock Exchange have been granted permanent recognition, the Metropolitan Stock Exchange of India Ltd. has been granted renewal of recognition while the remaining two stock • Both BSE and NSE together accounted for 99.99 per cent of turnover during 2012–13.

exchanges, Magadh Stock Exchange and the Delhi Stock Exchange, have been de-recognized and are in the process of exiting. Out of the four permanent exchanges, Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and Calcutta Stock Exchange are also in the process of exit. Pursuant to the exit policy for de-recognized/ non-operational stock exchange notified by SEBI in 2012, 17 stock exchanges have exited so far. Of these, 12 exited during 2012–13, 2013–14 and 2014–15 and five more stock exchanges exited during 2015–16. Now there are no regional stock exchanges as both Calcutta Stock Exchange and Ahmedabad Stock Exchange who had been granted permanent recognition have exited in 2017.

SEBI laid down a framework in November 2008, to promote several trading platforms or exchanges for trading of shares of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

## **I Eligibility criteria for setting up of new stock exchange/platform of an existing stock exchange for the SME sector**

## **Measures To Boost Liquidity In The Secondary Market**

A number of measures were taken by the SEBI to increase liquidity in the stock market. The stock market was opened to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) for investment. The depository system, stock-lending system, buy-back of shares, market making system, margin trading of shares, and rolling

At present there are no regional stock exchanges.

settlement were introduced to increase liquidity in the stock market. A brief profile of each of these measures is presented as follows:

# **Investment by Foreign Institutional Investors in the Indian Stock Market**

An important feature of the 1990s was the participation of FIIs in the stock market. FIIs were allowed to participate in the Indian capital market in September 1992. Earlier, FIIs could invest in Indian securities only through the purchase of GDR, foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), and foreign currency bonds issued by Indian issuers.

The SEBI (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995, define foreign institutional investor as an institution established or incorporated outside India, which proposes to make investment in India in securities. They are eligible to purchase shares and convertible debentures issued by Indian companies under the Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS).

FIIs commenced their operations in the Indian stock markets with a token investment of  $\bar{v}0.6$  crore in January 1993. They have become active investors since August 1993. FIIs such as mutual funds, pension funds, and country funds are operating in the Indian capital market.

## *Routes for Investment in Indian Stock Markets*

There are three routes through which FIIs can invest in the Indian stock market. The first is the direct route, the second is participatory notes and the third is through FII sub-accounts. In the direct route, the foreign entity applies to the SEBI for registration as FII. Sub-account means any person resident outside India, on whose behalf investments are proposed to be made in India by a foreign institutional investor and who is registered as a sub-account under SEBI (FII) regulations. The names of the sub-accounts on whose behalf the Foreign Institutional Investor is investing are to be disclosed to the SEBI by the Foreign Institutional Investor. An institution or fund or portfolio established or incorporated outside India, a broad based fund or proprietary fundor a foreign corporate or individual can register as sub-accounts. The government allowed listed foreign companies with an asset base of not less than \$2 billion and a proven track record of profitability and foreign individuals with a minimum net worth of \$50 million to register as sub accounts and trade in local stocks.

FIIs have to clearly segregate their own funds and that of their sub-accounts. The SEBI simplified the process of approval of sub-accounts of registered FIIs. FIIs can setup sub-accounts in Mauritius to enter India. While sub-accounts have certain administrative costs, it is less expensive than buying a participatory note. India has a double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) with Mauritius, which makes it an attractive platform for flow of investment to India. Because of the tax avoidance treaty, most FIIs are registered in Mauritius and declare their income as capital gains and pay no tax. SEBI has also made it mandatory for FIIs to disclose all information relating to sub-accounts through joint undertakings. The sub-account applicant and the FII through whom the application for registration is made, have to submit joint undertakings. These include a written submission that the sub-account is not a non-resident Indian (NRI) or an overseas corporate body and the source of income of the applicant is from known and legitimate means. The total number of FIIs and sub-accounts registered with SEBI as on September 18, 2008 was 1,506 and 4,576 respectively.

Participatory notes (P-notes) are overseas derivative instruments issued by SEBI-registered FII to foreign investors for trading in the Indian stock market. These derivative instruments derive value from underlying securities such as equity and equity-linked instruments. These foreign investors do not get registered with SEBI out of choice or regulatory issues. As they are not registered with the SEBI, the identity of the actual investor and source of funds remain disguised. These notes are generally issued by associates of India-based foreign brokerage houses. Morgan Stanley, Credit Lyonnais, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are the biggest issuers of participatory notes. The SEBI issued some directives to monitor investment through participatory notes. It is mandatory for FIIs to fully disclose various details of offshore derivatives instruments such as participatory notes, equity linked notes and others With effect from February 2004, participatory notes against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regulated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can also be made to other regulated entities only subject to compliance with 'know your client requirements.' This means that FIIs can not issue participatory notes to unregulated entities such as Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) and non-resident Indians (NRIs). It is mandatory for FIIs to report the issuance/renewal/cancellation/redemption of such **instruments** 

#### **FIIs in India**

- Direct route
- Participatory notes
- FII sub-account
#### *FIIs and their impact on the Indian Stock Market*

#### **Role of FIIs in the Indian Stock Market**

- Trendsetters
- Market movers
- Promoters of new technology and trading.

It is the influence of the FIIs which changed the face of the Indian stock market. Screen-based trading and depository are realities today largely because of FIIs. Equity research was something unheard of in the Indian market a decade ago. It was FIIs who eased the pressure on the rupee from the balance of payments' position and lowered the cost of capital to Indian business. It is due to FIIs that a concept like corporate governance is being increasingly adopted by Indian companies; this is benefiting domestic investors also. FIIs are the trendsetters in any market. They were the first ones to identify the potential of the Indian technology stocks. When the rest of the investors invested in these scrips, they exited the scrips and booked the profits. Before the arrival of FIIs, the activity in stocks used to be evenly distributed, with a little difference between the volumes in specified and cash groups. However, since FIIs concentrate on the top 200 companies against the 6,000 listed companies on the BSE, stocktrading activity has concentrated in these liquid scrips, making the less-liquid scrips totally illiquid. Thus, FIIs have become the driving force behind the movements of stock indices in the Indian stock markets.

Looking to the active participation of FIIs in the Indian stock markets, many broking firms converted into corporate entities. This corporatization of brokerage houses resulted in an increased transparency of broking firms and reduction of broking charges, which, in turn, added more depth and width into the bourses.

Rolling settlement was introduced at the insistence of FIIs, as they were uncomfortable with the *badla* system. The major beneficiaries of the rolling-settlement system are FIIs, as short-settlement cycles offer them a quick exit from the market.

With their massive financial muscle, FIIs have almost replaced the conventional market movers of the Indian bourses. Today, financial institutions and mutual funds including UTI can do little to help the stock markets at a time of crisis. Even UTI, which used to be a counter force for FIIs, has ceased to play that role in the Indian stock markets.

FII inflows create a bull run which encourages participation of small investors. FIIs caused the bull run of 2003 which enabled the government to carry out its disinvestment programme.

### **FOREIGN PORTFOLIO INVESTORS**

## **Depositories**

The increase in the volume of activity on stock exchanges with the advent of on-screen trading coupled with operational inefficiencies of the former settlement and clearing system led to the emergence of a new system called the depository system. The SEBI mandated compulsory trading and settlement of select securities in dematerialized form. All securities are held, traded, and settled in demat form. Two depositories have come into existence—the NSDL and the CDSL. Demat settlements have eliminated bad deliveries and other related problems associated with physical securities.

Depositories are discussed in detail in Chapter 18.

## **Buy Back of Shares**

Buy back of shares means that a company purchases or buys back its own shares, which it had issued previously to the shareholders. The company has the option to either cancel them or hold them as treasury-frozen stock. The difference, though technical, is significant. For example, a company buys back one crore equity shares of the face value of  $\bar{\tau}$ 10 at  $\bar{\tau}$ 100 each. If the shares are cancelled, the equity base of the company will be reduced by  $\overline{\tau}10$  crore, while the reserves will be depleted by  $\overline{\tau}90$  crore. If the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock, the shares will not be extinguished but will be held neither as an investment nor as equity. They can be revived by reissuing them at a later date or for employee option.

A company may be motivated to buy back its own shares for any of the following reasons:

- A company with surplus cash to invest and buy back may consider it to be a worthwhile investment proposition as it carries minimum risk compared with other avenues of investment such as investment in new projects, development of new products, acquisitions, and takeovers.
- For a company facing a threat of hostile takeover, share buy back would help its promoters to increase their proportional shareholding in the company.
- A company may think of altering its capital structure if its equity is disproportionately large. Buy back may help the company to achieve a target capital structure.
- A panic driven fall in share prices can be arrested through buy back of shares.
- A company intending to improve market quotes of its scrips may choose buy back rather than pay higher dividends as buy back signals management confidence. Moreover, buy back provides an exit route to investors in case of illiquid scrips.

Buy back is a tool to increase the wealth of the shareholders. With share buy back, a reduction in the floating stock of the company takes place, which improves the earnings per share (EPS) which, in turn, increases the market price of the share. At high market prices, a company can come out with new issues at a premium and thereby lower its cost of capital.

**Methods of Share Buy Back** Section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 contains the basic framework for companies to buy back its own securities. Section 77A (5) provides the methods of buy back . The buy-back under sub-section (1) may be:

- a. from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis; or
- b. from the open market; or
- c. from odd lots, that is to say, where the lot of securities of a public company, whose shares are listed on a recognized stock exchange, is smaller than such marketable lot, as may be specified by the stock exchange; or
- d. by purchasing the securities issued to employees of the company pursuant to a scheme of stock option or sweat equity.

The SEBI (Buy back of Securities) Regulations, 1998 contains the procedure for buy back. Share buy back can be done in two ways: through a tender offer or through an open market repurchase. The tender offer to shareholders can be either at the market price or at a premium to the market. In going for a tender offer route, a company can adopt a fixed price tender or go for an auction. Auctions are generally held when a company is under a takeover threat and is interested in buying back a large number of shares at the lowest possible price.

The open market repurchase route is used when the desired number of shares to be bought back is relatively small. Buy back from the open market can be either through the book building process or by direct purchase on the stock exchange. Most companies prefer the open market purchase route.

**Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998** The buy back of shares was prohibited in India until October 31, 1998. Indian companies were permitted to buy back their own shares by the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998. The ordinance inserted two new sections (77A and 77B) in the Companies Act, 1956 which laid down the provisions and restrictions relating to buy back of shares. Under the new provision, a company may buy back its own shares or other specified securities from its free reserves, securities premium account, or the proceeds of an earlier issue other than a fresh issue of shares made specifically for buy back purpose.

Buy back is permitted only when the company satisfies the following conditions:

- It is authorized by its articles.
- A special resolution has been passed in the general meeting of the company authorizing the buy back.

• When a company repurchases its own shares, it is buy back of shares.

• A company can buy back its shares either through a tender offer or through an open market repurchase.

- The buy back does not exceed 25 per cent of the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company.
- The debt equity (including free reserves) ratio is not more than 2:1 after such buy back.
- All shares and other specified securities are fully paid-up.
- The buy back is in accordance with the SEBI regulations framed for the purpose.

It is further stipulated that a company that has defaulted on repayment of deposit, term loan, redemption of debenture/preference shares and so on, will not be permitted to buy back shares. Buy back of shares through subsidiary companies or investment companies is also prohibited.

Following the promulgation of the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, the SEBI issued regulations on the buy back of shares by listed companies on November 10, 1998. The facility of buy back of securities by listed companies was introduced to increase liquidity in securities and to enable companies to enhance the shareholders' wealth.

The SEBI has a stipulated time limit to ensure the completion of the buy back process, speedily. If shares are bought back through stock exchanges, an offer for buy back should not remain open for more than 30 days. The verification of shares received in the buy back has to be completed within 15 days of the closure of the offer. The payments for accepted securities has to be made within 7 days of the completion of verification and bought-back shares have to be extinguished within 7 days of the date of the payment.

The SEBI relaxed buy back norms in 2001. Companies can now buy back shares upto 10 per cent of the equity capital and free reserves just by a board resolution, without seeking shareholders' approval. The moratorium on the fresh issue of shares after a buy back programme was reduced to 6 months from the earlier 24 months. On October 25, 2001, the SEBI relaxed the yearly creeping acquisition limit by promoters to 5 per cent from 10 per cent a year without the SEBI approval. On October 27, 2008, the SEBI allowed promoters to buy upto 75 per cent in listed companies through the creeping acquisition route-5 per cent a year without the SEBI approval.

These relaxed norms led to a spurt in buy back activity. The biggest buy back earmarked in 2001 was that of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)—to the tune of  $\bar{\tau}1,100$  crore at  $\bar{\tau}353$  per share. The other large buy backs were Bajaj Auto ( $\overline{720}$  crore) followed by Raymonds ( $\overline{7486}$  crore), GE Shipping  $(\bar{\tau} 150 \text{ core})$ , and Indian Rayon ( $\bar{\tau} 143 \text{ core}$ ).

Most blue chip companies such as Cadburys, Reckitt Benckiser, Philips, and others offered to buy back shares at more than a 25 per cent premium to market price. This move was on account of various reasons. One of the reasons cited is that these MNCs were forced to go public by the government in the late 1970s. Now there were no restrictions or obligations for them to remain listed on the domestic exchanges. Another reason cited is that with stringent listing requirements—MNCs found it both difficult and expensive to adhere to these requirements. These delistings were done as a part of a costcutting exercise and not for shutting down of the Indian operations. Moreover, the centre has been liberalizing foreign direct investment (FDI) norms since the early 1990s. MNCs can set up 100 per cent subsidiaries or increase the parent's stake in their existing subsidiaries, associates, or affiliates by way of creeping acquisition, or an open offer. These delistings are a loss to the domestic investors who not only part with the shares at a depressed price but are also deprived from participating in the future growth of these companies. The exit of these companies took place when there was dearth of good quality paper. Moreover, it had an adverse impact on market capitalization, liquidity, as well as volumes at the exchanges.

Most of the buy backs by cash-rich corporates were at cheap prices, leaving minority shareholders stranded. The price of the share buy backs were based on prices of the previous six months and during that time, share prices were quite low. Many of the promoters took advantage of low prices to hike their stake.

In buy-back regulations the regulator found that there were instances where companies were announcing a buy-back at a certain price and they were not even using 25 per cent of what was allotted for buy-back. Moreover, some companies are trying to use the buy-back regulations not to reward shareholders but to manipulate the share price. Hence, SEBI is now coming out with a new buy-back regulation and has already come out with a discussion paper on share buy-back.

#### 1. **Minimum buy back quantity**

1.1 Pursuant to the order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal dated 26.09.2008 in the matter of Sasken Communications Limited and after observing instances of companies not buying a single share or buying negligible quantity after buy-back announcement, the Merchant Bankers are being advised to ensure that a minimum of 25 per cent of maximum buy-back proposed/ disclosed and bought back.
Companies on an average have bought back 49.96 per cent of the maximum quantity proposed for buyback in the financial years 2009–10 and 2010–11 after the aforesaid prescription. Taking the above into consideration, it is proposed to mandate 50 per cent as the minimum quantity.

#### 2. **Maximum period to complete the buy back**

It is proposed that companies complete the buy back in 3 months. To ensure that only serious companies launch the buyback program, it is further proposed that these companies be mandated to put 25 per cent of the maximum amount proposed for buy back in an escrow account.

#### 3. **Post buy back obligations**

It is proposed that listed companies coming out with buyback programs may not be allowed to raise further capital for a period of two years.

#### 4. **Disincentive for not completing the buyback program successfully**

In order to ensure that the companies do not launch buyback programs for stabilizing the share price, it is proposed that companies who are not able to buy back 100 per cent of the proposed amount (or the proposed maximum number of shares) may not be allowed to come with another buyback for a period of atleast one year irrespective of the mode of approval for buy back.

#### 5. **Rationalization of ongoing disclosure requirements**

The following are proposed:

- i. The company shall disclose the number of shares purchased and the amount utilized to the exchanges on daily basis.
- ii. The company shall disclose the following details regarding the buyback offer to the exchanges on monthly basis and also include the same while publishing quarterly and annual results:
  - a. Total number of shares proposed to be bought back in the offer.
  - b. Cumulative number of shares bought back till the end of previous reporting period and amount utilized for the same.
  - c. Number of shares bought back during the current reporting period and amount utilized for the same.
  - d. Cumulative number of shares bought back till the end of the current reporting period and amount utilized for the same (b+c).
  - e. Number of shares yet to be bought back and amount yet to be utilized.
  - f. Cumulative number of shares extinguished and destroyed till the end of previous reporting period.
  - g. Number of shares extinguished and destroyed during the current reporting period
  - h. Cumulative number of shares extinguished and destroyed till the end of the current reporting period (f+g).
- iii. It is felt that the current requirement of publishing the disclosures in the news papers on fortnightly basis and every time an additional 5 per cent of maximum shares on offer were bought back only adds to the cost of buyback program. In view of the above and in view of the same being included as part of quarterly financial results which are published, it is proposed to do away with the requirement of fortnightly publication. iv. In addition, the companies have to disclose on a monthly basis why the proportionate quantity was not bought during the month, wherever applicable.

#### 6. **Limit for open market method**

It is proposed that buy-back of 15 per cent or more of (paid up capital + free reserves) must be only by way of a tender offer method.

### 7. **Procedure for buy-back of physical shares (odd lot) in Open Market Purchase Method** The following changes are proposed:

- i. Creation of separate window in trading system for buying physical shares. This window will remain open only during the buy-back program.
- ii. Shareholders holding 500 shares or less in physical form will be eligible to tender their shares in this window (It may be noted that the trading in Odd Lot Segment on the exchange is also limited to 500 shares).
- iii. Such shareholders may be permitted to tender shares to a broker designated for the purpose by the company, without the need to open a trading account or strict compliance with KYC norms.

However, the requirement of PAN/Aadhar may be made mandatory for such shareholders holding shares in the physical form.

- iv. The shareholder can tender the shares to the designated broker directly or to the company, who can then put the transaction through the designated broker.
- v. Buy-back price for such shareholders may be Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the shares bought (in the normal segment) during the calendar week in which such shares were received by the broker. In case no shares were bought back in the normal market during the aforesaid week, the last week when the company has bought may be considered.
- vi. The Public Announcement shall contain information mentioned above.

### 8. **Removal of restriction on issuance of shares pursuant to Employee Stock Option (ESOP) schemes during the buy-back offer**

It is proposed that the issuance of shares pursuant to obligations arising out of Employee Stock Option schemes may be allowed during the buy-back period subject to the following:

- i. The shares are not allotted to directors and key managerial personnel of the company.
- ii. There is no acceleration in the vesting period.

### 9. **Extinguishment of shares in buyback process**

The following is proposed regarding extinguishment of shares in open market purchase method of buyback:

- i. The companies shall extinguish/destroy shares bought back during the month, on or before fifteenth day of the succeeding month subject to the companies destroying the bought back shares in the last month within seven days of the completion of the offer.
- ii. As detailed disclosure regarding extinguishment and destruction of shares have been proposed above, the existing requirement of furnishing a separate certificate by the company to SEBI in this regard may be done away with.
- 10. **Dealing in shares or other specified securities in the stock exchange during the period of buy back**

Section 19(1 )(e) of SEBI(Buy back of Securities) regulations, 1998 reads as under:

"The company shall ensure that the promoter or the person shall not deal in the shares or other specified securities of the company in the stock exchange during the period the buy-back offer is open."

It is proposed to extend this restriction to dealing in the securities of the company in off market as well.

# **Conclusion**

Buy back of shares was permitted to increase liquidity in securities. However, buy backs resulted in the delisting of good scrips and brought low prices to small shareholders. To prevent the delisting of good scrips, the SEBI issued directives that a company could delist only if it had been listed on a stock exchange for a minimum period of three years. The draft of the new takeover code suggests that delisting would not be allowed through the buy back route. The centre should also revise the FDI guidelines with a view to encouraging even those MNCs which are setting up a 100 per cent subsidiary to list eventually within a certain time frame.

# **Market Making System**

The extensive reforms in the last decade have transformed the operations of the securities market. Transaction costs have reduced and transparency has increased with the introduction of electronic trading and order-matching system at all stock exchanges. However, there are still a large number of shares that are not actively traded despite the fact that many of them have some intrinsic value.

To provide liquidity to the illiquid scrips, market makers are required who will continuously provide two way quotes. A market maker puts up a buy quote and a sell quote simultaneously. Thus, he creates a market for a scrip wherein it can be easily bought and sold. This process is called market making mechanism. For rendering these services, the market maker is allowed to buy and sell at a different rate, with the differential rate ranging from 3 per cent to 10 per cent. This difference is his income for providing these services.

Market making was much in use during the floor-based trading era when jobbers used to play the role of market makers. However, market making is almost absent in the screen-based trading era. The major hindrances to its development are the non-availability of back-finances to brokers, lack of incentives such as authority to route trades through market makers, and lack of market depth. The market making scheme has been introduced in the derivatives segment also where it has not yielded the expected results.

• Market maker is an individual or a firm who gives two-way: buy and sell quotes for a stock(s).

Internationally, the market making concept is highly advanced and a highly specialized job, with select firms specializing in it. The market making responsibility is taken up by firms who have specialized in this activity on the basis of the size of the companies and select industries. Some market makers cater to particular regions of the country or purely to institutional clients. The market making activity is very active in the US markets, especially in NASDAQ. Among the top NASDAQ-listed companies, Oracle has as many as 101 active market makers followed by Cisco systems with 99, Dell Computer with 90, Applied Materials with 88, Intel with 86, and Microsoft with 82. Moreover, Indian stocks such as Sify, with 13 market makers, are clocking an average daily volume of around 50,000 to 60,000 trades, and Rediff, with 9 market makers, manages 4,000 to 5,000 trades. NASDAQ has around 4,730 companies listed, of which over 90 per cent manage to trade on any given day. This volume of trading is due to active market makers. However, in the BSE, out of 5,700 listed companies, hardly 1,500 manage to trade on a given day.

In India, a systematic and organized form of market making was initiated by the OTCEI. At the OTCEI, market making is a compulsory activity and the sponsor has to act as a market maker for at least three years. At the regional stock exchanges, some brokers tried to give two-way quotes to revive some illiquid scrips, but they could not be successful.

To facilitate the market making system on Indian stock exchanges, the SEBI set up a committee on market making under the chairmanship of G. P. Gupta (Chairman, IDBI) to study various facets of market making, including the merits and demerits of the two trading systems—the order driven system and quote driven system. The committee was of the view that shares could be classified into two categories—liquid and illiquid— and market making facility should be provided for illiquid shares. The committee stressed the obligation of market makers to offer continuous two-way quotes which would force them to carry an inventory of stocks. However, this would require a large commitment of capital and lead to an increased exposure to market risks. It is expected that the stock lending scheme and margin trading would give an impetus to market making.

In April, 2010, SEBI put in a framework for setting up of new exchange or separate platform of existing stock exchange having nationwide terminals for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Market making has been made mandatory in respect of all scrips listed and traded on SME exchange. The following guidelines shall be applicable to the Market Makers on the stock exchanges and SME exchange:

# **Guidelines for Market Maker**

With the view to infuse liquidity in the market, the concept of market maker was proposed. Since the introduction of electronic trading and "order matching" system in all the stock exchanges there has been a reduction in transaction costs, speedier execution of trades and gains in liquidity. The volumes have risen a hundred fold in respect of many shares. Increase in trading volume on the exchanges, however, has not been reflected always in the liquidity of all the listed shares. There are a large number of shares that are not actively or frequently traded although many of them have some fundamental strength and intrinsic value. The introduction of market making facility for such shares could be a possible means to infuse liquidity in such shares. The guidelines for market maker as provided below.

Over the past several years the securities market has witnessed a sea change. The market has become more modern in terms of infrastructure, adoption of best international practices and introduction of competition. With the maturity of the regulatory framework and increased market surveillance, the market has also become safer and investor is better protected. The extensive reforms introduced by SEBI over the last few years have enhanced the integrity, transparency and efficiency of the operations of the securities market. The introduction of electronic trading and "order matching" system in all the stock exchanges, have led to reduction in transaction costs, speedier execution of trades and gains in liquidity. The, spreads have dropped by a factor of 10 and volumes have risen a hundred fold in respect of many shares. Increase in trading volume on the exchanges, however, has not been reflected always in the liquidity of all the listed shares. There are a large number of shares that are not actively or frequently traded although many of them have some fundamental strength and intrinsic value. The introduction of market making facility for such shares could be a possible means to infuse liquidity in such shares.

The Market Maker would operate under the regulatory framework as envisaged and laid out herewith in these guidelines. The Exchange would act as a SRO for the purposes of monitoring and effective operations of the Market Makers. The Exchanges have been accorded flexibility to make modifications to the scheme to make it more attractive to the Market Maker to take up commitments under this scheme, however, the terms of selection of scrips, the capital adequacy norms and the risk containment measures such as the price bands and margins would not be altered from those stipulated in these guidelines.

### **I. 1. Criterion for selection of scrips for Market Making**

- ii. Threshold for market making as prescribed will be inclusive of mandatory inventory of 5% of issue size at the time of allotment in the issue.
- iii. Any initial holdings over and above such 5% of issue size would not be counted towards the inventory levels prescribed.
- iv. Apart from the above mandatory inventory, only those shares which have been acquired on the platform of the exchange during market making process shall be counted towards the Market Maker's threshold.
- v. Threshold limit will take into consideration, the inventory level across market makers.
- vi. The market maker shall give two way quotes till he reaches the upper limit threshold, thereafter he has the option to give only sell quotes.
- vii. Two way quotes shall be resumed the moment inventory reaches the prescribed reentry threshold.
- viii. In view of the market maker obligation, there shall be no exemption/threshold on downside. However, in the event the market maker exhausts his inventory through market making process on the platform of the exchange, the concerned stock exchange may intimate the same to SEBI after due verification.

# **Stock Lending and Borrowing (SLB)**

Securities Lending and Borrowing scheme is a facility for lending and borrowing of shares to enable investors to honour trades involving short-selling. The stock lending and borrowing scheme is essentially a facility for short sellers. A short seller is a person who sells shares which he does not own/possess. With the ban on badla, short sellers were often left with uncovered positions when the prices of scrips moved against expectations. This had to be met through auctions, which led to an increase in the loss of short sellers, as auction prices were higher than the last traded prices. Short selling enables the seller to hedge the risk of a long position in the same security or a related security. It enhances market efficiency through price discovery, improves liquidity in the secondary market and reduces volatility in market returns. However, it may also lead to a downward trend in prices, thus, destabilizing the market.

The stock lending and borrowing scheme enables a short seller to minimize his losses by borrowing shares at the time of settlement. As scrips are delivered at the time of settlement, the number of scrips auctioned reduces considerably.

The stock-lending scheme enables a seller to borrow shares from a SEBI-registered intermediary and deliver them to a buyer against outstanding commitments. When the price declines, he replaces the borrowed shares by buying from the market. The borrower of the securities pays the lender interest on the value of the securities borrowed. The borrowers of securities are usually brokers, speculators, market makers, custodian banks, clearing corporations, and finance companies. The lenders are mutual funds, insurance companies, custodian banks, finance companies, brokers, and high net worth individuals.

### *Broad Framework for Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing*

Pursuant to the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC) of SEBI, it was decided to permit all classes of investors to short sell. In order to provide a mechanism for borrowing of securities to enable settlement of securities sold short, it has also been decided to put in place a fullfledged Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) scheme for all market participants in the Indian securities market under the over-all framework of "Securities Lending Scheme, 1997" of SEBI. The Securities Lending Scheme was notified by SEBI on February 06, 1997. The guidelines for this facility of short selling and framework for securities lending and borrowing are specified in Annexure 1 and 2.

To enable the mechanism of short selling, the facility of SLB scheme, was put in place for all market participants, under the overall framework of "Securities Lending Scheme, 1997" of SEBI.

### *Annexure 1 – Broad framework for short selling*

- 1. "Short selling" shall be defined as selling a stock which the seller does not own at the time of trade.
- 2. All classes of investors, viz., retail and institutional investors, shall be permitted to short sell.
- 3. Naked short selling shall not be permitted in the Indian securities market and accordingly, all investors would be required to mandatorily honour their obligation of delivering the securities at the time of settlement.

• Stock lending enables a short seller to borrow stocks from approved intermediaries.

#### **Stock Lending**

- Provides an avenue to stock lenders to earn income.
- Increases liquidity of stock.
- Stabilises market movements.
- Avoids delivery failures.
- Makes difficult manipulation of stock price.

- 4. No institutional investor shall be allowed to do day trading, i.e., square-off their transactions intra-day. In other words, all transactions would be grossed for institutional investors at the custodians' level and the institutions would be required to fulfill their obligations on a gross basis. The custodians, however, would continue to settle their deliveries on a net basis with the stock exchanges.
- 5. The stock exchanges shall frame necessary uniform deterrent provisions and take appropriate action against the brokers for failure to deliver securities at the time of settlement which shall act as a sufficient deterrent against failure to deliver.
- 6. A scheme for SLB shall be put in place to provide the necessary impetus to short sell. The introduction of a full-fledged securities lending and borrowing scheme shall be simultaneous with the introduction of short selling by institutional investors.
- 7. The securities traded in F&O segment shall be eligible for short selling. SEBI may review the list of stocks that are eligible for short selling transactions from time to time.
- 8. The institutional investors shall disclose upfront at the time of placement of order whether the transaction is a short sale. However, retail investors would be permitted to make a similar disclosure by the end of the trading hours on the transaction day.
- 9. The brokers shall be mandated to collect the details on scrip-wise short sell positions, collate the data and upload it to the stock exchanges before the commencement of trading on the following trading day. The stock exchanges shall then consolidate such information and disseminate the same on their websites for the information of the public on a weekly basis. The frequency of such disclosure may be reviewed from time to time with the approval of SEBI.

## *Annexure 2 – Broad framework for Securities Lending and Borrowing*

- 1. The stock exchanges shall put in place, a full-fledged SLB scheme, within the overall framework of "Securities Lending Scheme, 1997" (the scheme), that is open for all market participants in the Indian securities market.
- 2. To begin with, the SLB shall be operated through clearing corporation/clearing house of stock exchanges having nation-wide terminals who will be registered as Approved Intermediaries (AIs) under the SLS, 1997.
- 3. The SLB shall take place on an automated, screen based, order-matching platform which will be provided by the AIs. This platform shall be independent of the other trading platforms.
- 4. In addition to the scrips on which derivatives contracts are available, scrips that fulfill the following criteria shall be considered eligible for SLB:
  - a. Scrip classified as 'Group I security'
  - b. Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) of the scrip, shall not be less than  $\overline{100}$  crores; and
  - c. average monthly trading turnover in the scrip in the cash market shall not be less than  $\overline{5}100$ crores in the previous six months.
- 5. Stock exchanges shall review the scrips eligible for SLB on a half-yearly basis. In the event a scrip fails to meet the eligibility criteria, no new SLB transaction shall be allowed in the scrip from the next trading day. However, the existing contracts in such scrips shall be allowed to continue till expiry.
- 6. All categories of investors including retail, institutional, etc., will be permitted to borrow and lend securities. The borrowers and lenders shall access the platform for lending/borrowing set up by the AIs through the Clearing Members (CMs) (including banks and custodians) who are authorized by the AIs in this regard.
- 7. The Authorised Intermediary (AIs) shall enter into an agreement with CMs for the purpose of facilitating lending and borrowing of securities. The agreement shall specify the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties to the agreement. The agreement shall include the basic conditions for lending and borrowing of securities as prescribed under SLB framework. Further, the exact role of AIs/CMs vis-à-vis the clients shall be laid down in the agreement. AIs shall ensure that there shall not be any direct agreement between the lender and the borrower. In addition to that, AIs may also include suitable conditions in the agreement to have proper execution, risk management and settlement of lending and borrowing transactions with clearing member and client. The AIs shall frame a rights and obligations document laying down the rights and obligation of CMs and clients for the purpose of lending and borrowing of securities. The rights and obligation document shall be mandatory and binding on the CMs and the clients for executing trade in the SLB framework.

- 8. The AIs shall allot a unique ID to each client which shall be mapped to the Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the respective clients. The AIs shall put in place appropriate systemic safeguards to ensure that a client is not able to obtain multiple client IDs.
- 9. The tenure of contracts in SLB may be upto a maximum period of 12 months. The approved intermediary (Clearing Corporation/Clearing House) shall have the flexibility to decide the tenure (maximum period of 12 months).
- 10. The settlement cycle for SLB transactions shall be on T+1 basis. The settlement of lending and borrowing transactions shall be independent of normal market settlement.
- 11. The settlement of the lending and borrowing transactions shall be done on a gross basis at the level of the clients, i.e., no netting of transactions at any level will be permitted.
- 12. AIs would frame suitable risk management systems to guarantee delivery of securities to borrower and return of securities to the lender. In the case of lender failing to deliver securities to the AI or borrower failing to return securities to the AI, the AI shall conduct an auction for obtaining securities. In the event of exceptional circumstances resulting in non-availability of securities in auction, such transactions would be financially closed-out at appropriate rates, which may be more than the rates applicable for the normal close-out of transactions, so as to act as a sufficient deterrent against failure to deliver securities.
- 13. Position limits at the level of market, CM and client shall be decided from time to time by AIs in consultation with SEBI. To begin with (a) the market– wide position limits for SLB transactions shall be 10% of the free-float capital of the company in terms of number of shares (b) No clearing member shall have open position of more than 10% of the market-wide position limits or  $\overline{$}50$  crore (base value), whichever is lower (c) For all institutional investors, the position limits shall be the same as of a clearing member (d) The client level position limits shall be not more than 1% of the market-wide position limits.
- 14. There shall be no lending/borrowing activity during the periods of corporate action in the security and shall be disclosed by AI to the market.
- 15. Details of treatment of corporate actions during the tenure, such as dividend, stock split etc., are specified as below:
  - a. *Dividend:* The dividend amount would be worked out and recovered from the borrower on the book closure/ record date and passed on to the lender.
  - b. *Stock split:* The positions of the borrower would be proportionately adjusted so that the lender receives the revised quantity of shares.
  - c. *Other corporate actions such as bonus/merger/amalgamation/open offer, etc.:* The transactions would be foreclosed from the day prior to the ex-date. The lending fee would be recovered on a prorata basis from the lender and returned to the borrower.
- 16. Any borrowing/lending and return of securities would not amount to purchase/disposal/transfer of the same for the purpose of compliance with the extant FDI/FII limits and the norms regarding acquisition of shares/disclosure requirements specified under the various regulations of SEBI.
- 17. Adequate systems shall be put in place by the stock exchanges/depositories to distinguish the SLB transactions from the normal market transactions in the demat system.
- 18. AIs shall provide suitable arbitration mechanism for settling the disputes arising out of the SLB transactions executed on the platform provided by them.
- 19. AIs shall disseminate in public domain, the details of SLB transactions executed on the platform provided by them and the outstanding positions on a weekly basis. The frequency of such disclosure may be reviewed from time to time with the approval of SEBI.
- 20. The time for SLB session may be extended to the normal trade timings of 9:15 am to 3:30 pm.
- 21. Risk Management
  - a. With regard to risk management in SLB, it is advised that common risk management practices shall be followed by stock exchanges for SLB. It is reiterated that the exchanges should ensure that the risk management framework strikes a balance between ensuring commercial viability of SLB transactions and ensuring adequate and proper risk management. Exchanges should satisfy themselves regarding the adequacy of the risk management system.
  - b. The collateral to be accepted for meeting margin obligations related to SLB transactions shall be in the same form as applicable in the cash market.
- 22. The lender/borrower shall be provided with a facility for early recall/repayment of shares.
- 23. In case the borrower fails to meet the margin obligations, the AI shall obtain securities and square off the position of such defaulting borrower, failing which there shall be a financial close-out.

- 24. In case lender recalls the securities anytime before completion of the contract, the AI on a best effort basis shall try to borrow the security for the balance period and pass it onward to the lender. The AI will collect the lending fee from the lender who has sought early recall.
- 25. In case of early recall by the lender, the original contract between the lender and the AI will exist till the contract with the new lender for the balance period is executed and the securities returned to the original lender.
- 26. In case of early repayment of securities by the borrower, the margins shall be released immediately on the securities being returned by the borrower to the AI. The AI shall on a best effort basis, try to onward lend the securities and the income arising out of the same shall be passed on to the borrower making the early repayment of securities.
- 27. In case AI is unable to find a new borrower for the balance period, the original borrower will have to forego lending fee for the balance period.
- 28. In case of early recall by lender or early repayment of securities by borrower, the lending fee for the balance period shall be at a market determined rate.

#### *Operationalisation of Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing*

The broad framework for short selling by institutional investors and a full-fledged securities lending and borrowing scheme for all market participants were operationalized with effect from April 21, 2008.

### **Introduction of Roll-over Facility**

- 1 Any lender or borrower who wishes to extend an existing lent or borrow position shall be permitted to roll-over such positions, i.e., a lender who is due to receive securities in the pay out of an SLB session, may extend the period of lending. Similarly, a borrower who has to return borrowed securities in the pay-in of an SLB session, may, through the same SLB session, extend the period of borrowing. The roll-over shall be conducted as part of the SLB session.
- 2 Roll-over shall not permit netting of counter positions, i.e., netting between the 'borrowed' and 'lent' positions of a client.
- 3 Roll-over shall be available for a period of 3 months, i.e., the original contract plus 2 roll-over contracts.

## **Introduction of Liquid Index Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) under the SLB scheme**

- 1 Liquid Index ETFs shall be eligible for trading in the SLB segment.
- 2 For the purposes of this circular, an Index ETF shall be deemed 'liquid' provided the Index ETF has traded on at least 80% of the days over the past 6 months and its impact cost over the past 6 months is less than or equal to 1%.
- 3 Positions limits for SLB in respect of ETFs shall be based on the assets under management of the respective ETF.

## *Advantages of SLB*

Stock lending and borrowing (SLB) provides an avenue for institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds, financial institutions and insurance companies to earn income by lending their idle stock in the market. The lender of the stock charges interest for lending the stock. The rate of interest charged by the lender is determined by various factors such as liquidity of the scrip, quality of management, size of the underlying company and the risk involved in lending the stock. The lender does not cease to be the owner of the stock and gets all beneficial rights such as dividend, rights or bonus shares in respect of the stock lent. The borrower, however, has the legal title of the borrowed securities and is entitled to deal with and dispose of securities in any manner he deems fit.

Stock lending provides an avenue for institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds, financial institutions, and insurance companies to earn income by lending their idle stock in the market.

Stock lending increases the liquidity of stocks as more and more players are able to sell or take positions. It keeps a bull market in check. Stock lending through the clearing house can help carry forward short sales and check volatility in the share prices at the time of settlement. It facilitates timely settlement and avoids delivery failures.

Stock lending aids in the development of the derivatives markets. It enables investors to undertake arbitrage activities either against derivative trades or convertibles.

SLB aids in the development of the derivatives markets. This scheme is largely used by the institutional investors while writing complex option contracts. It enables investors to undertake arbitrage activities either against the derivative trades or the convertibles.

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) exempted stock lending from capital gains, making it even more attractive. With the depository system in operation and the process of dematerialization almost complete, the risk involved (the chance of not getting the same clean stock) in stock lending is substantially reduced. It also does not attract STT.

## **Conclusion**

The new scheme failed to take-off. The market players find it to be unfriendly and over-regulated, citing the following reasons:

- 1. Margins levied on trades in the SLB segment are too high and, sometimes, work out to be 100 per cent or more making the trade unviable. In the derivatives and off-shore lending market, the margin requirement is about 25–30 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. The high execution costs are a hindrance.
- 2. There would be an attempt to distort prices or other forms of market manipulation if the details of SLB transactions executed by the market participants are publicly disseminated.

## **Rolling Settlement**

The dematerialization of shares and introduction of settlements in demat form changed the face of the Indian stock markets. The next major reform in the new millennium affecting the stock markets was the introduction of rolling settlement.

This concept is not new to the Indian stock market. The OTCEI was the first exchange to introduce rolling settlement when it started operations in 1992. Rolling settlement was not a success for the OTCEI as there was no margin trading facility for borrowing funds or shares.

Rolling settlement was introduced by the SEBI for the first time in January 2000 in selected scrips. Initially, 10 scrips were brought under rolling settlement. Subsequently, on March 8, 2000, 153 more scrips were introduced. Rolling settlement was introduced in the form of  $T+5$  settlement system where  $T'$  is the trade date and '5' is the number of business days after the trade date on which delivery of securities and cash payments are due for settlement. In other words, T+5 means that all open positions at the end of trading date result in delivery and payment five working days later. If trading takes place on Thursday, it will be settled the following Thursday, so on and so forth. This cycle would be rolling and hence there would be a set of transactions for delivery every day. Thus, rolling settlement means converting the market into a cash market, since each day's transactions are settled in full.

Table 8.4 illustrates Weekly Settlement and Rolling Settlement and Table 8.5 shows difference between weekly settlement and rolling settlement.

Rolling settlement system replaced the *badla* system from July 2, 2001. When 215 scrips were brought under the rolling system, bringing the total to 414 scrips. By January 2, 2002, all scrips were brought under the compulsory rolling mode. Internationally, most developed countries follow a T+3 cycle and are aiming to move to a  $T+1$  cycle (next day settlement) or a  $T+0$  cycle where trades are settled on the day they are executed (same evening settlement). This system of  $T+0$  is prevalent in Switzerland and volumes are phenomenal when compared to the T+3 system. Indian stock markets moved to the T+3 system from April 2002, in line with the recommendations of the 'Group of Thirty' which suggested it as the minimum international standard.

On the advice of the SEBI, stock exchanges levy an additional charge to discourage late confirmations by the custodians and have provided a system for handling shortages of funds and securities in an expeditious manner to adhere to the schedule for payment.

The stock brokers are required to adhere to the following schedule in the  $T+2$  rolling settlement.

In a  $T+2$  settlement, confirmation and determination of obligation takes place on a  $T+1$  basis, while pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities happens on the second day of trading. Shorter settlement cycles lower the trading costs for market participants and reduce the risk of counter-party failure. The SEBI now aims for a  $T+1$  cycle. In a  $T+1$  settlement, as soon as an investor buys shares, the broker's trading terminal will give the buy order, the system will check the investor's bank account and debit funds and in turn, deposit shares in his demat account within a few seconds.

• Rolling settlement is a system of settling transactions in a fixed number of days after the trade is agreed.

#### *Advantages of Rolling Settlement*

- The basic advantage of rolling system over the *badla* system is its simplicity. The *badla* system was non-transparent and unregulated and the investors' exposure to risk and fraud was very high. The investor had to keep track of different stocks as they had different settlement systems. With rolling settlement, the investor has to merely keep track of the day of purchase/sale of scrips as all the scrips are settled in the same format on all trading screens.
- This system eliminates arbitrage opportunities in scrips.
- It improves the price discovery process as the settlement process is standardized and the participants can focus more on market outcomes.
- This improvement in price discovery would lead to a single, well-defined price that can be used for information processing by different economic agents.
- It reduces settlement risk and narrows the bid–ask spreads (difference between the bid and offer prices) due to its transparent nature.

## **Rolling Settlement**

- Simple
- Eliminates arbitrage opportunities.
- Improves price discovery process.
- Reduces settlement risk.
- Encourages wider participation.
- Eliminates fluctuation of prices.
- Reduces price manipulation.

- It encourages wider participation as institutional investors forbidden from doing *badla* or netting trades within a settlement can now take advantage of this system as it shortens delay in settlement of transactions.
- It eliminates fluctuations of prices which take place around settlement dates. With the setting up of clearing corporations, rolling settlement reduces the working capital requirements of brokerage firms.
- As it reduces price manipulation and arbitrage, it helps in reducing volatility and turbulence in the markets.
- Finally, retail investors benefit as it shortens the delays for converting securities into cash and vice versa.

It is perceived that rolling settlement kills liquidity as it reduces speculation and arbitrage. This reduction in liquidity may be a short-term feature as investors and brokers need time to adjust to this new system and to digest the fact that they will not get any leverage. In rolling settlement, one cannot short sell a scrip which creates an impact on liquidity.

In the Indian stock markets, six to seven stocks account for nearly 70 per cent of the volume of trading. When these heavily traded forward stocks are covered under rolling settlement, liquidity is bound to reduce for some time. Moreover, day trading has emerged and will grow in a short span of time. Day traders are people who trade during the day and close all their positions at the end of the trading day. They take advantage of the day time movements of scrip prices and indices by directly executing orders, resulting in increased liquidity. Besides day traders, FIIs are more comfortable with the rolling settlement system and it is expected that money will be pumped into the Indian stock markets resulting in high liquidity.

According to a SEBI study titled 'Cost–Benefit Analysis of Contracting, Trading, Clearance and Settlement in Equities to  $T+1$ , the cost–benefit ratio of migrating to  $T+1$  works to 0.85. This means for every likely expense of 0.85 paise, there will be a benefit of Re 1 and the investors will be the biggest beneficiaries as they will be able to save in the form of interest on margin money.

The prerequisites for the success of the rolling system—margin trading, continuous net settlement, depository, futures and options, and a strong banking system with electronic fund transfer facility—are now in place. These will help in improving the efficiency and prospects of success of this system. It is superior technology and banking infrastructure such as electronic fund transfers which will enable Indian markets to move to the  $T+1$  or  $T+0$  settlement system.

### **Conclusion**

Stock markets moved to the  $T+2$  system from April 1, 2003. The SEBI intends to move to  $T+1$ . The move towards  $T+1$  is part of the capital market reforms initiated by the SEBI, especially after the stock market scams. The rolling settlement system of share transactions prevents speculations in between the settlement periods. Movement to the  $T+1$  system, requires real time gross settlement (RTGS) in banking transactions. RTGS would ensure that banking transactions are settled within a day's time. This would, in turn, facilitate share transactions to be settled within a day. For moving over to the T + 1 system, the SEBI has implemented a straight through processing (STP) system to prevent delays in share transfer from the buyer to the seller. The STP system reduces the time gap between trading and settlement. It leads to greater transparency and reduction in counter-party risk. The STP system leads to an automatic debit or credit in the demat account and bank account of traders. The

#### **Box 8.4** Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)

The RTGS system ensurestransfer of funds on a realtime and on a one-to-one basis(*i.e.*, between a sender and a beneficiary)in an electronic mode. The system leads to reduced settlement and systemic risks, especially in high-value inter-bank transactions. The RBI launched RTGS on March 26, 2004. In RTGS, payments are settled transaction by transaction and settlement of funds is final, irrevocable and done in real time. Moreover, funds settled can be used immediately. Under the RTGS system, inter-bank transactions, customer-based inter-bank transactions and net-clearing transactions of both high value and retail payments can be settled. It is a fully secured system which uses digital signatures and public-key encryption forsafe and secure message transmission. It is beginning to enable transfer of fundsin a cheque-less environment.

The threshold limit for high value transactions is one lakh and below this limit low-value transactions take place. Clearing and settlement in the RTGS environment takes place electronically — based on instructions provided by banks to the clearing cell of the RBI. Atleast 72 banks have participated in the system, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the value of inter-bank settlement. Of the 72 banks, 32 participating banks offer customer-related RTGS fund transfer services through 840 branches in 134 major centres.

RBI has already directed banks to speed up branch automation and networking. The RTGS is already launched in April 2005.

# **Straight Through Processing (STP)**

STP was launched in December 2002 in a limited manner to enable market participants to smoothly transit to a shorter settlement cycle of T+2 in April 2003.

STP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions in one pass from the point of first deal to the final settlement. It allows any information generated at one end to reach its destination uninterrupted by avoiding manual interference. The entire process of trade execution and settlement is electronic and carried on through a seamless connectivity between custodian, fund manager and broker. It avoids re-entry of the same details by different market participants.

STP is a prerequisite for a shorter settlement cycle. Initially, it was used by institutional participants on a voluntary basis.

Now there are various service providers like NST, IT (NSE subsidiary), NSDL Financial Technologies and Omgeo (Joint Venture between the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation and Thomson Financial). These service providers provide STP connectivity to market participants. The RBI has also developed Infinet, a STP package devised only for banks and bank-related transactions.

In order to ensure inter-operability between market participants, the NSE has a sector STP Centralized Hub. All institutional trades, executed on the stock exchanges are mandatorily processed through the STP system effective from July 1, 2004.

Besides eliminating manipulation, STP also helps in reducing the settlement cycle, improving transparency, reducing counter-party risk, operational risk and avoiding punching errors.

#### *STP and Manual Trade: A Comparison*

In a manual trade, the broker issues a contract note which is then passed on to the custodian or a depository participant. There are multiple data entries from paper documents during the different stages in the manual trade which makes the process susceptible to errors, discrepancies, delays and manipulation of trade. In STP, however, the contract note is issued in electronic forms and the entire trade is settled on the computer leaving no scope for manipulation. Moreover, compared to manual trade, STP is faster, risk-free and eliminates any failure in trade.

The SEBI also prescribed the framework for the system flow of the STP, which is as follows.

- An STP user intending to send an instruction should send the message to his STP service provider after digitally signing the same.
- The STP service provider after verification of the signature should forward it to the recipient user, if the recipient is availing services of the same STP service provider, or the STP centralized hub if the recipient is not with the same STP service provider. In such a case, the STP service provider should be required to prepare a message as per the STP centralized hub prescribed message format, enclose the user's message, digitally sign it and then send it to the STP centralized hub.
- On receipt of the message by the STP centralized hub, it should verify the signature of the sending STP service provider and then send an acknowledgement to the sending STP service provider.
- The STP centralized hub would then forward the message to the recipient STP service provider after digitally signing on the message.
- The recipient STP service provider, on receipt of the message from the STP centralized hub, has to verify the signature of the STP centralized hub, verify if the recipient STP user is associated with itself and send an appropriate acknowledgment with digital signature to the STP centralized hub. The STP centralized hub would, in turn, forward the acknowledgement (received from the recipient STP service provider) duly signed to the sending STP service provider.
- The recipient STP service provider should forward the message to the recipient STP user who would verify the signature of the recipient STP service provider and sending STP user.

STP and RTGS will pave the way for  $T+1$  settlement.

# **Margin Trading**

Margin trading is a new concept in India. The RBI has allowed banks to finance margin trading in shares w.e.f. September 18, 2001.

Margin trading allows an investor to invest in excess of his financial capacity by providing only a part of the funds for the deal. The balance funding comes from banks in the form of borrowing. Margin trading permits investors to buy shares by providing 40 per cent of the deal value as 'margin,' while borrowing 60 per cent from banks. Banks provide finance to investors through stockbrokers for trading in actively traded scrips. Initially, 53 • Straight through processing is a seamless connectivity of trades from initiation to settlement without manual intervention.

• Margin trading is a form of leveraged trading which allows an investor to invest in excess of his financial capacity by borrowing money.

scrips forming part of NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex were identified for margin trading. Banks extend funding for margin trading within the overall existing ceiling for bank exposure to the capital market.

The securities purchased by borrowing a portion of the deal from banks are used as collateral. Backed by the collateral, an investor can buy assets which are greater in value than the value of the collateral. Hence, margin trading is a form of leveraged trading which leads to an increase in the purchasing/selling power of the participants and helps them increase their earnings if the market price of securities move along expected lines.

The concept of margin trading is used as a means to infuse liquidity in the system. Banks, both private and public, can invest 5 per cent of total outstanding credit in equities with the leeway of fixing their own rates of interest. Today, banks are flush with funds and have immense potential to lend. However, they have to safeguard their loans and take risk containment measures.

Margin trading is a sort of deferral product. Investors generally use margins to own more shares without fully paying for them. However, margin trading creates a systemic risk that can lead to sharp volatility in the stock market.

**The Mechanism of Margin Trading** Suppose an investor has  $\bar{\tau}40,000$  and he is willing to buy a share quoting at  $\bar{\tau}40$ . Under the present settlement system, he can buy a maximum of 1,000 shares with his own money. With margin trading, he can buy as many as 2,500 shares worth  $\bar{\tau}$  one lakh from his broker by paying  $\bar{\tau}40,000$  as margin and by borrowing the balance  $\bar{\tau}60,000$  from a bank through his broker. The broker pledges the 2,500 shares with the bank. The bank has a collateral of  $\text{\textsterling}1,00,000$  backing the loan of  $\text{\textsterling}60,000$ .

Suppose the market price of the share moves up to  $\overline{50}$  and the investor sells the shares. Had the investor not taken the benefit of margin trading, he would have realized only  $\overline{\tau}10,000$  (1,000 shares  $\times$ ( $\overline{50}$ −40)) as profit. With margin trading, he gained  $\overline{25,000}$  (2,500 shares  $\times$  ( $\overline{50-40}$ )). His net gain would be equal to gains from the sale of shares less interest on bank borrowings.

If the market price of the share falls below  $\bar{\tau}40$ , the bank will give a margin call under which the investor will have to furnish additional funds/securities for the broker to pass on to the bank.

The RBI hiked the margins borrowers have to keep with banks for loans against shares and investments in primary equity issues. From December 28, 2004, the margin requirement for advances against shares, initial public offerings and issue of guarantee will be 50 per cent as against 40 per cent earlier. The RBI also advised banks to raise the minimum cash margin of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. This means that the overall margin must have a 25 per cent cash component, which could be in the form of fixed deposit certificates, while the balance would be shares valued at the current market price.

Margin trading offers banks a unique opportunity to park short-term funds at a high rate of interest. Even small investors get an access to bank funds without being exploited by stockbrokers and other financiers. Margin trading is the cleanest form of leveraged buying of assets. It is a transparent mechanism for channelizing funds into the stock markets. With margin trading, the chances of scams are also reduced.

Banks will have to evolve adequate risk management systems for safeguarding loans given by them against a collateral of securities. Moreover, reforms in the payment system are needed to bring about improvement in the infrastructure for funds transfer. Margin trading is an attractive mechanism which ensures a no-default market with high levels of collateral and offers modest leverage to investors thereby increasing liquidity in the stock market.

**SEBI Margin Trading Norms** Margin trading through bank financing failed to pick-up as banks were reluctant to fund stock market purchases. With a view to providing more liquidity in the stock markets and creating a level-playing field between institutional and small investors, the SEBI introduced margin trading with effect from April 2004. The SEBI has permitted brokers, banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) registered with the Reserve Bank, insurance companies and financial institutions to finance margin trading, *i.e.*, borrowing money to part-finance stock purchases.

**The Salient Features of the New Guidelines are as Follows** Member-brokers are allowed to provide margin trading facility to their clients, in the cash segment, subject to the following conditions:

**Securities Eligible for Margin Trading** SEBI has categorized the securities under 3 groups, namely, Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3. The securities having mean impact cost of less than or equal to 1 and having traded on atleast 80(+/−5) per cent of the days for the previous eighteen months, have been categorized as Group 1. The securities in Group 1 would be eligible for margin trading facility.

In addition to the Group 1 securities, all the securities which are offered in the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and which meet the conditions for inclusion in the derivatives segment of the Stock Exchanges would be eligible for Margin Trading Facility.

**Eligibility Requirements for Brokers to Provide Margin Trading Facility to Clients** Only corporate brokers with a 'net worth' of at least  $\overline{*}3.00$  crore would be eligible to offer margin trading facility to their clients. The 'net worth' for the purpose of margin trading facility would mean 'Capital' (excluding preference share capital) plus free reserves less non allowable assets, i.e fixed assets, pledged securities, member's card, non-allowable securities, bad deliveries, doubtful debts and advances (including debts and advances overdue for more than 3 months or given to associates), pre paid expenses, intangible assets and 30 per cent of the marketable securities.' The broker shall submit to the stock exchange a half-yearly certificate, as on 31st March and 30th September of each year, from an auditor confirming the net worth . Such a certificate shall be submitted not later than 30th April and 31st October of the year.

**No-objection Certificate** Before providing Margin Trading Facility to a client who has already availed of Margin Trading Facility from another broker, the broker is required to obtain a no-objection certificate in writing from the other broker. The other broker shall be required to convey his objection/if any, in writing, within a period of 21 days from the date of receipt of query from the broker, failing which the broker would be free to proceed with providing Margin Trading Facility to the client.

**Agreement** The broker shall enter into an agreement with his client for providing the margin trading facility, on the lines of the model agreement, enclosed as Annexure 1. The broker/exchange may modify the agreement only for stipulating any additional or more stringent conditions, provided that no such modification shall have the effect of diluting any of the conditions laid down in the circular or in the model agreement.

#### **Source of Funds for the Broker for Providing Margin Trading Facility to his Clients and Maximum Permissible Borrowing by any Broker**

- 1. For the purpose of providing the margin trading facility, a broker may use his own funds or borrow from scheduled commercial banks and/or NBFCs regulated by RBI. A broker shall not be permitted to borrow funds from any other source.
- 2. The broker shall not use the funds of any client for providing the margin trading facility to another client, even if the same is authorized by the client.
- 3. At any point of time, the total indebtedness of a broker for the purpose of margin trading shall not exceed 5 times of his net worth (calculated as stated above).
- 4. The 'maximum allowable exposure' of the broker towards the margin trading facility shall be within the self imposed prudential limits and shall not, in any case, exceed the borrowed funds and 50 per cent of his 'net worth'.
- 5. The term 'exposure' will mean the aggregate outstanding margin trading amount in the books of the broker for all his clients. While providing the margin trading facility, the broker shall be prudent and also ensure that there is no concentration on any single client. In any case, the exposure to any single client at any point of time shall not exceed 10 per cent of the broker's lendable resources (*i.e.*, borrowed funds for the purpose o margin trading + 50 per cent of net-worth).
- 6. While providing the margin trading facility, the broker shall be prudent and also ensure that there is no concentration on any single client. In any case, the exposure to any single client at any point of time shall not exceed 10 per cent of the 'total exposure' of the broker, (calculated as per (5) above).

**Margin Requirements** The initial and maintenance margin for the client shall be a minimum of 50 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, to be paid in cash. For this purpose;

- 1. 'Initial margin' would mean the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of the transaction value, to be placed by the client, with the broker, before the actual purchase. The broker may advance the balance amount to meet full settlement obligations.
- 2. 'Maintenance margin' would mean the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of the market value of the securities, calculated with respect to the last trading day's closing price, to be maintained by the client with the broker.

When the balance deposit in the client's margin account falls below the required maintenance margin, the broker shall promptly make margin calls. However, no further exposure can be granted to the client on the basis of any increase in the market value of the securities.

The exchange/broker shall have the discretion to increase the margins (as mentioned above) and in such a case, the margin call shall be made, as and when required. Fixed deposits with banks and Bank Guarantees shall be treated as cash equivalents and shall be considered as acceptable form of intial and maintenance margins for the purpose of availing the Margin Trading Facility.

**Liquidation of Securities by the Broker in Case of Default by the Client** The broker may liquidate the securities if the client fails to meet the margin call made by the broker or fails to deposit the cheques on the day following the day on which the margin call has been made or where the cheque deposited by the client has been dishonoured.

The broker may also liquidate the securities in case the client's deposit in the margin account (after adjustment for mark to market losses) falls to 30 per cent or less of the latest market value of the securities, in the interregnum between making of the margin call and receipt of payment from the client.

However, the broker shall not liquidate or use in any manner the securities of the client in any situation other than the ones mentioned above.

**Maintenance of Records** The broker shall maintain separate client wise accounts of the securities purchased on margin trading with depositories and shall enable the client to observe the movement of securities from his account (through internet). The broker shall also maintain a separate record of details (including the sources) of funds used for the purpose of margin trading.

The books of accounts, maintained by the broker, with respect to the margin trading facility offered by it, shall be got audited on a half yearly basis. The broker shall submit an auditor's certificate to the exchange/s, within one month from the date of the half year ending 31st March and 30th September of a year certifying, inter alia, the extent of compliance with the conditions of margin trading facility.

SEBI and the stock exchange/s shall have the right to inspect the books of accounts and/or any other documents maintained by the broker with respect to the margin trading facility.

**Disclosure of Exposure to the Margin Trading Facility** The broker shall disclose to the stock exchange/s details on gross exposure including name of the client, Unique Identification Number (UIN) under the SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003, name of the scrip and if the broker has borrowed funds for the purpose of providing margin trading facility, name of the lender and amount borrowed, on or before 12 noon on the following day. The stock exchange/s shall disclose the scrip wise gross outstanding in margin accounts with all brokers to the market. Such disclosure regarding margin trading done on any day shall be made available after the trading hours on the following day, through its website.

The stock exchanges shall also put in place a suitable mechanism to capture and maintain all relevant details including member-wise, client-wise, scrip-wise information and source of funds of the members, pertaining to margin trading on their exchange, both on daily as well as on cumulative basis.

**Arbitration** The arbitration mechanism of the exchange would not be available for settlement of disputes, if any, between the client and broker, arising out of the margin trading facility. However, all transactions done on the exchange, whether normal or through margin trading facility, shall be covered under the arbitration mechanism of the exchange.

**Usage of Investor Protection Fund and Trade/Settlement Guarantee Fund** The amounts lying in the aforesaid funds would not be available for settling any loss suffered in connection with the margin trading facility. However, the aforesaid funds will continue to be available for all transactions done on the exchange, whether normal or through margin trading facility.

**General Provisions** The brokers wishing to extend the facility of margin trading to their clients would be required to obtain prior permission from the exchange/s where the margin trading facility is proposed to be provided. The exchange shall have the right to withdraw this permission at a later date, after giving reasons for the same.

A broker should take adequate care and exercise due diligence before providing margin trading facility to any client. Any broker providing margin trading facility to a client shall ensure that the client has obtained a Unique Identification Number (UIN) under the SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003.

A client will be allowed to obtain margin trading facility from one broker per exchange for buying securities in that exchange. To ensure this, it shall be obligatory on the part of every broker to,

- 1. obtain a declaration from his client whether he has availed of any margin trading facility from any broker in any exchange, or whether his request for margin trading with any broker was rejected and if so, in both the cases, obtain the name of the broker and his registration number; and
- 2. also verify the details from the concerned broker/s.

Before providing margin trading facility to a client who has already availed of margin trading facility from another broker in the same exchange, the broker shall ensure that the client has liquidated his outstanding in the margin trading account with the other broker, and obtain a certificate to this effect in writing from that broker.

# **Conclusion**

Margin trading will add to volumes on stock exchanges through increased demand and supply of securities and funds. The move will open up a new revenue stream for brokers in line with international practices. It will also allow investors to take a long-term call on the market and borrow funds to take up positions. Being a leverage mechanism, it injects liquidity in the market which, in turn, adds to the depth of the market and aids in price discovery. It is a mechanism which leads to the integration of money and capital markets.

On the flip side, margin trading can be risky as it encourages speculation. To avoid this, the regulator will have to strictly collect data on margin trading and educate investors about the perils of margin trading.

Margin Trading scheme has been a non-starter among brokers. The norms are too stringent. Marginfunding norms do not allow accepting stock as collaterals and 50 per cent initial margin is required to purchase a stock. This is why most of the brokers prefer the NBFC route.

# **Impact Of Reforms And Measures On Secondary Market Activities**

Reforms were undertaken to widen and deepen the secondary market to turn it into a vibrant market. A vibrant secondary market is a prerequisite for the development of an active primary market. Whether reforms have made any positive impact on the volatility, liquidity, size, and transaction cost is a matter of analysis.

• **Volatility:** Volatility of a stock measures the frequency with which changes in its market price take place over a period of time. If a stock is highly volatile, *i.e.*, if there are large fluctuations in its market prices, there is a risk and investors avoid these shares. Hence, volatility is a factor, which is taken into consideration when assessing the risk–return trade offs. Moreover, volatility has macroeconomic implications in volatility of stocks. Volatility in the market is a function of information, misinformation (rumours) and sometimes lack of information.

Volatility is caused by a number of factors such as speculation, the trading and settlement system, the government budget, inflation, interest rates, announcement of corporate results, the extent of integration with international markets, the regulatory framework governing the stock market, rumours, day trading, and derivatives trading. All these factors directly or indirectly influence movements in share prices.

The coefficient of variation in both the BSE Sensex and the S&P CNX Nifty was high in the years 1998–99 and 1999–2000. This indices a high volatility of Indian stocks. The factors responsible for high volatility were as follows.

- Inclusion of the new economy stocks, most of which were over-valued in the BSE Sensex.
- Increased influence of international stock indices, especially the NASDAQ. The repercussion of the crash in technology stocks on the NASDAQ was witnessed on Indian IT stocks also.
- High speculation when the *badla* system was prevalent led to large fluctuations in prices.
- Day trading increased which led to wild fluctuations in intra-day prices.
- Foreign institutional investors FIIs, exit the markets at the slightest whiff of trouble. This increases volatility in the stock markets. Domestic investors follow FIIs and emulate their investment pattern. If FIIs buy, everyone buys and if FIIs sell, everyone sells.
- Indian markets have high volume but they lack depth as the volumes are contributed by few institutional participants. Indian markets lack hedge funds and pension funds, which can take a longterm view of the markets. Moreover, domestic financial institutions like UTI, which used to act as a counter-force in the time of crisis, have stopped being a force to reckon with. This lack of depth increases volatility in the stock market.

The volatility in share prices was contained in 2000–01 and 2001–02 due to the introduction of rolling settlement which restricts speculation. However, the volatility in share prices increased in 2003–04. The stock markets were volatile in 2003–04 due to various factors.

• The uncertainty relating to the formation of the new government after the general elections created a turbulence on May 17, 2004. The market ended the day with a net loss of 11.1 per cent as compared • Volatility is fluctuations or changes in a stock's market price.

with the previous day's close. The trading was halted twice during the day due to the application of the index-based circuit breakers.

- External factors such as rising oil prices and apprehensions of rise in international rates contributed to high volatility.
- The announcement in the Union Budget 2004–05 regarding imposition of the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) affected the market sentiments adversely.
- Huge activity in the F&O segment has contributed to volatility in the cash market. Most of the volumes in the F&O segment arise from arbitrage trading to take advantage of price differentials in the cash and futures markets. FIIs, too, indulge in cash-futures arbitrage. Volatility tends to increase towards the close of every month, when futures expire. Squaring up of positions in the F&O market either by liquidating or roll over results in a corresponding fall in shares prices in the cash market. In a roll over, a trader liquidates the position for the current month and takes position for the forthcoming month.
- Short selling followed by hectic short covering of positions on rumours led to volatility. A trader can go short in the F&O market. Short selling is also allowed on an intra-day basis. Another option is to sell short in the cash market by borrowing shares. Big brokerages allow clients to sell short by lending shares from the pool account.
- Day traders thrive on intra-day movements of stocks and indices. A day trader purchases stocks at lower levels in early trade and sells them once the stock reaches his desired level. Uncertainty or lack of information means more opportunities for a day trader to enter and exit, resulting in increased turnover and volatility in the market.
- Rumours such as hearsay of income-tax raids on brokers, FII investments slowing down, an imminent ban on participatory notes and fresh margins in the FI segment of the NSE play havoc with the stability of the markets.
- The SEBI, the regulatory agency of the capital market, did not act fast in clarifying its stand on the participatory notes (PNs) which resulted in the Sensex shedding 470 points and over  $\bar{\tau}1,25,000$  crores in the market capitalization during January 19–22, 2004. PNs are derivative instruments, which represent Indian shares issued overseas. Usually, registered FIIs or foreign brokerages issue PNs to those FIIs not registered in India but who want an exposure to the Indian markets. The SEBI suspected that a few overseas corporate bodies (OCBs) were funded by non-resident Indians (NRIs) and were investing in the Indian markets through PNs. The SEBI banned fresh issuance of PNs to unregulated entities and granted a grace period of 5 years for liquidation of the existing outstanding PNs. Issuance and transfer of PNs can now be to regulated entities only.

There was a sharp increase in volatility in 2008–09 on account of the rise in crude-oil prices, depreciation of dollar and global financial turmoil. Exchanges impose scripwise (20 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per cent and 2 per cent) and index-wise circuit filters to contain volatility. But there is a need for exchanges and regulators to take swift actions to contain volatility.

India's first volatility index—India VIX—was designed to indicate investors' perceptions of the market's volatility in the next 30 calendar days. The India VIX closed at 16.6 on March 31, 2016 as compared to 14.5 on March 31, 2015 registering an increase of 14.5 per cent, indicating investors' expectations of rising volatility.

Exchanges impose scrip-wise (20 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per cent, and 2 per cent) and index-wise circuit filters to contain volatility. But there is a need for exchanges and regulators to take swift actions to contain volatility.

**Liquidity** It is one of the most important indicators, that greatly influences stock market development and efficiency. It is also one of the factors affecting the price discovery mechanism. A market is considered to be liquid when large volume of trades can take place without any significant effects on price. When an investor is able to transact at a price close to the current market price in the stock market, the market is liquid.

Liquidity is an important parameter taken into consideration by FIIs while investing in a market. A highly liquid market implies higher FII inflows and reduced liquidity implies lower FII inflows, reduced market capitalization, poor sentiments, and inability of market participants to transact easily. Moreover, corporates are also unable to raise money from the markets for investment. There are two methods for measuring stock market liquidity—turnover ratio and value-traded ratio.

• **Turnover ratio:** It equals the total value of domestic shares traded divided by market capitalization. This ratio measures the trading of domestic equities on domestic exchanges relative to the size of the market. High turnover is often used as an indicator of low transaction costs. The turnover ratio also compliments the measure of stock market size since markets may be large but inactive. A large but inactive market will have a large market capitalization ratio but a small turnover ratio.

• **Value traded ratio:** It equals the total value of domestic shares traded on the major stock exchanges divided by the gross domestic product (GDP). It measures organized trading of firm equity as a share of the national output and, therefore, reflects liquidity on an economy-wide basis.

The value traded ratio captures trading relative to the size of the economy, while the turnover ratio measures trading relative to the size of the market. Thus, a small liquid market will have a high turnover ratio but a small value traded ratio. Such a stock market would not provide significant liquidity to the economy as a whole.

An analysis of the turnover ratio and value traded ratio indicates that liquidity has increased in the post-reforms period. The all-India turnover ratio and value traded ratio exhibit an increasing trend in the post-reforms era. The high turnover was due to the formation of the NSE in 1994–95. The turnover of the NSE surpassed the turnover of the BSE in the subsequent years of its existence. This contributed to a very high all-India turnover in the second half of the 1990s.

The turnover ratio increased substantially after the introduction of screen-based trading by the NSE. The turnover ratio increased from 21 in 1993–94 to 409.3 in 2000–01. This turnover ratio was one of the highest in the world. The value-traded ratio rose from 53.1 per cent in 2004–05 to 108.9 per cent in 2007– 08. An increase in the value traded ratio reflects an increase in the liquidity on an economy-wide basis.

The average daily turnover on the NSE and the BSE is now in excess of USD 2 billion which reflects the increasing liquidity in the market. The turnover ratio is poor in case of India compared with other developed and emerging markets. This is on account of concentration of trading in few stocks and higher promoter holding in companies. FIIs are attracted to markets with high turnover ratio as it means lower impact costs.

**Size of the Stock Market** The market capitalization ratio measures the size of the stock market and equals the value of listed domestic shares (market capitalization) divided by the GDP. In terms of economic significance, the assumption underlying the use of this variable as an indicator of stock market development is that the size of the stock market is positively correlated with the ability to mobilize capital and diversify risk.

The value traded ratio complements the market capitalization ratio. Although market capitalization may be large, there may be little trading. Market capitalization and value traded ratio together provide information about market size and liquidity.

The all-India market capitalization ratio which was 19.4 per cent in 1990–91 rose to 54.2 per cent in 1991–92, the year after the reforms were initiated. This was a year of a sharp increase in share prices. However, this was an aberration and the ratio declined sharply to 30.6 per cent during 1992–93 as share prices plummeted. The ratio increased sharply to 46.8 per cent in 1999–2000 but declined to 27.2 per cent in 2000–01. The size of the market has more than doubled and new sectors such as information technology, communication, pharmaceuticals, and fast moving consumer goods account for a major share in market capitalization. There was a sharp increase in the market capitalization ratio in 2005–06 and 2006–07 on account of an improvment in macro-economic fundamentals and a rise in new listings.

On October 14, 2006, the market capitalization of BSE crossed the country's GDP. The market capitalization of all listed stocks on BSE rose to  $\overline{33}$  lakh crore on October 14, 2006 and  $\overline{34}$  lakh crore on October 16, 2006 exceeding the GDP figure of around  $\overline{3}2$  lakh during financial year 2006.

After declining for three successive years, market capitalisation ratios showed improvement from 2013-14 onwards.

**Transaction Cost** Transaction costs consists of explicit costs such as brokerage, commission, and stamp duty, and implicit cost such as, impact cost, clearing and settlement cost due to counter-party risk, paper work, bad delivery and bid and ask spread. Transaction costs substantially impact returns, volumes, and volatility. Low transaction costs can induce the investor to trade more often which would lead to increased volumes resulting in low volatility.

Transaction costs were very high in the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s due to problems relating to physical share certificates such as bad deliveries, theft, and paper work. Moreover, there was an involvement of a chain of brokers in the execution of transactions and the method of trading was not transparent. There were no guarantees, and brokerage charges were heavy.

Many revolutionary changes have taken place in the Indian secondary market since November, 1994.

- The setting up of the NSE and the introduction of open electronic limit order book market by NSE and other exchanges.
- The emergence of a nationwide market through the spread of NSE VSATs and BOLT terminals.
- Reduction in brokerage fees and improved broking services owing to increased competition from NSE members and foreign brokers.

• Turnover ratio measures trading relative to the size of the market while value-traded ratio measures trading relative to the size of the economy.

• The market capitalization ratio has improved significantly indicating an increase in size of the market.

*Note:* This table attempts to quantify transaction costs borne by retail investors (*i.e.*, with small delivery-oriented transaction).

*Source:* Shah, A. and S. Thomas 'Securities Markets: Towards Greater Efficiency' in K. S. Parikh (eds), *India Development Report,* 1997, Chapter 10, pp. 167–92.

- Elimination of counter-party risk through the setting up of a clearing corporation—National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)—with strict enforcement of margins and exposure limits.
- The launch of a depository system in November, 1996 and majority of the shares compulsorily dematerialized.

All these developments have an impact upon transaction costs. An attempt was made by Shah and Thomas (1997) to quantify transaction costs, which are shown in Tables 8.6 and 8.7.

#### **Market Impact Cost**

• Market impact is the cost resulting from any change in the market price due to the execution of a large order of a given security at any given point of time.

Market impact cost is the cost faced by a user who places a market order as compared with an ideal price. In other words, it is a cost associated with percentage degradation in price due to the execution of large orders. The impact cost is considered as the most practical definition of liquidity. The impact cost is the percentage mark up from the (bid+ask)/2 suffered in executing a transaction. For example, if the bid–ask spread of a scrip is 10 to 20 paise and if the market price of the scrip is ruling at  $\overline{z}$ 215, then, if an investor is able to buy it at `215.15, the impact cost is minimum. Higher the liquidity of the stock, lesser is the impact cost and vice–versa. Impact cost is lower in markets with increasing trading depth. This results in lower cost of equity and thereby improves returns to shareholders. Impact cost is important for fund managers. High impact cost could lead to the index funds providing substantially lower returns than the benchmark index. According to the Economic Survey 2002–03, the impact cost for the purchase or sale of  $\overline{550}$  lakh Nifty portfolio dropped from 0.12 per cent in 2002 to 0.08 per cent in 2005 suggesting that the liquidity of stocks has improved.

A new tax—Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been imposed on Indian investor. STT has to be paid at the time of making the transaction. If it is a share or an equity mutual fund unit being traded on stock exchanges and it is a delivery based transaction then, at the time of purchase, STT at the rate of 0.125 per cent has to be paid by the purchaser and an equivalent tax has to be paid by the seller. Further, sale of units back to a mutual fund entails a tax at the rate of 0.25 per cent for the investor. Recently, on July 1, 2017, Goods and Service Tax (GST) has been imposed on Securities Transactions. Now the transaction cost consists of Brokerage cost, STT, exchange clearing cost, exchange transaction cost, stamp duty, Central GST (CGST), and State GST (SGST).

Table 8.6 shows that there was an almost 50 per cent reduction in costs in 1997. With complete dematerialization of shares in the future, the transaction cost is expected to come down by around 80 per cent.

*Source: Indian Securities Market—A Review,* NSE, September 2000.

The transaction costs declined substantially from 4.75 per cent in 1994 and 2.50 per cent in 1997 to 0.60 per cent of selling/buying price in 1999. A round-trip transaction cost of a transaction of  $\overline{50,000}$ works out at 2.30 per cent in 2006 – brokerage of about one per cent, impact cost about 1 per cent, securities transaction tax 0.25 per cent and depository transaction charges about 0.05 per cent.The transaction cost compares well with the global best markets. The reduction in transaction costs is an indicator of improvement in market efficiency and stock market development.

## **Conclusion**

Indian stock markets have a history of more than 140 years. They have undergone a sea change in the last decade. Technology has changed the face of the stock markets. New trading systems, new stock exchanges, new players, new instruments, and new markets have come into existence. Today, the Indian equity market is one of the most technologically developed in the world and is on par with other developed markets abroad. The introduction of an online trading system, dematerialization, ban of the *badla* system, and introduction of rolling settlement have facilitated quick trading and settlements which lead to larger volumes. The setting up of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited has revolutionalized the face of the stock markets. Today the NSE is the market leader and the 140-year-old BSE is lagging behind. The NSE, in a very short span of time, has taken the leading position as it is perceived to be investor-friendly. In the future only two exchanges will survive—the NSE and the BSE. With globalization, these exchanges will face stiff competition internationally. They will have to gear themselves up to face international competition. They should strive to increase transparency, strictly enforce corporate governance norms, provide more value added services to investors, and take steps to increase investor confidence. These stock exchanges will have to plan strategic tie-ups with their foreign counterparts to get an international platform. A developed and vibrant secondary market can be an engine for the revival and growth of the primary market.

**Summary**

- 1. Secondary market is a market in which existing securities are resold or traded. This market is also known as the stock market.
- 2. In all, there are, at present, 23 stock exchanges in India—19 RSEs, the BSE, the NSE, the OTCEI, and the Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India (ISE).
- 3. The OTCEI and the NSE are demutualized exchanges wherein the ownership and management of the exchange are separated from the right to trade on exchange.
- 4. Demutualization is the process by which any member-owned organization can become a shareholder-owned company. Such a company could either be listed on a stock exchange or be closely held by its shareholders.
- 5. A company has to list its securities on the exchange so that they are available for trading. A company can seek listing on more than one stock exchange but it is compulsory to list on the RSE nearest to its registered office. The basic norms for listing of securities are uniform for all exchanges. The SEBI has set up a central listing authority (CLA). It has spelled out the norms for the CLA.
- 6. The open outcry system, prevalent a few years ago on regional stock exchanges, has been replaced by an online screen-based electronic trading system. The NSE and the OTCEI had adopted screen-based trading right from inception.
- 7. The electronic trading system is superior to the open outcry system of the past. It ensures transparency, increases information efficiency by allowing faster incorporation of price sensitive information into prevailing prices and results in operational efficiency as there is a

reduction in time, cost, risk of error, and fraud and elimination of a chain of brokers and jobbers, which result in low transaction costs.

- 8. The circuit breakers bring about a halt/suspension in trading automatically for a specified period if the market prices vary unusually on either side, *i.e.*, move out of a pre-specified band.
- 9. To eliminate various problems such as theft, fake/forged transfers, transfer delays, and the paperwork associated with physical certificates, an electronic book entry form of holding and transferring securities has been introduced.
- 10. Internet trading in India made its debut in April 2000. Through this means of trading, investors can buy and sell shares online through the Internet.
- 11. The stock market index is the most important indices of all as it measures overall market sentiment through a set of stocks that are representative of the market. The stock market index is a barometer of market behaviour. It reflects market direction and indicates dayto-day fluctuations in stock prices.
- 12. There are two major indices in India: the BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty. The BSE Sensitive Index of equity share prices was launched in 1986. It comprises 30 shares and its base year is 1978–79. Another index which has become very popular in a short span of time is the S&P CNX NIFTY.
- 13. The carry forward system, or *badla,* was a unique feature of the Indian stock exchanges, particularly of the BSE. *Badla* was a unique selling proposition of the BSE. *Badla* provided the facility for carrying forward the transaction from one settlement to another. This old system has been replaced by a new system—rolling settlement.

- 14. The oldest stock exchange of India (the BSE) faced rough weather when the National Stock Exchange (NSE) was set up in 1994. It was opined that the BSE would not be in a position to face stiff competition from this new and modern stock exchange. However, the BSE revamped its operations quickly, adopted modern technology, and gave tough competition to the NSE. This competition among the exchanges has made the Indian capital market more mature.
- 15. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) completed 16 years of operations on June 30, 2010. The exchange is credited with technology innovation, speeding up of the process for dematerialization, introduction of effective risk containment measures and the introduction of derivatives trading. It is a dominant stock exchange accounting for over 85 per cent of the traded volume in the cash and futures segment.
- 16. The OTCEI is based on the model of National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) of USA, with modifications to suit the Indian conditions. It commenced operations from October 6, 1992. Even though the OTCEI is based on the model of NASDAQ, it has been languishing right from the beginning.
- 17. The Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India (ISE) was set up as the twenty-third stock exchange in the country. The ISE, promoted by 15 RSEs, opened a new national segment of trade to all members of the exchanges while retaining the regional segments of trading at these exchanges. This stock exchange has also failed to make its presence felt in the Indian stock market. It failed to take-off as investors preferred buying scrips from the BSE or the NSE rather than from the ISE. The ISE is now a member of both the NSE and the BSE.
- 18. One significant aspect of the Indian capital market is the existence of as many as 15 regional stock exchanges (RSEs)—the highest in the world. The emergence of a number of RSEs was the result of India's geographical and telecommunications limitations. There is insignificant or no trading at all in these stock exchanges. The percentage of turnover on regional stock exchanges is negligible.
- 19. In March 2004, the BSE and the Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) put forth a joint proposal to form a common trading platform to provide small and medium enterprises (SMEs) easy and an efficient access to capital market. The BSE launched this enterprise market—INDOnext for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on January 7, 2005.
- 20. An important feature of the 1990s was the participation of FIIs in the stock market. FIIs were allowed to participate in the Indian capital market in September, 1992. They have become active investors since August, 1993. FIIs such as mutual funds, pension funds, and country funds are operating in the Indian capital market. The total number of FIIs registered with the SEBI till January 2005 stood at 638 and they pumped in USD 8.5 billion into India, which was also a historic high. FII inflows create a bull run which encourages participation of small investors. FIIs caused the bull run of 2003 which enabled the government to carry out its disinvestment programme.
- 21. Buy back of shares means that a company purchases or buys back its own shares, which it had issued previously to the shareholders. Buy back is a tool to increase the wealth of the shareholders. The SEBI (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations, 1998 contain the procedure for buy back. Share buy back can be done in two ways: through a tender offer or through an open market repurchase. Most of the buy backs by cash-rich corporates were at cheap prices, leaving minority shareholders stranded.
- 22. To provide liquidity to the illiquid scrips, market makers are required who will continuously provide two-way quotes. A market maker puts up buy quote and a sell quote simultaneously. Thus, he creates a market for a scrip wherein it can be easily bought and sold. This process is called market making mechanism. In India, systematic

and organized form of market making was initiated by the OTCEI where, market making is a compulsory activity and the sponsor has to act as a market maker for at least three years. At the regional stock exchanges, some brokers tried to give two-way quotes to revive some illiquid scrips, but they could not be successful.

- 23. The stock lending scheme enables a seller to borrow shares from a SEBI-registered intermediary and deliver them to a buyer against outstanding commitments. When the price declines, he replaces the borrowed shares by buying from the market. The borrower of the securities pays the lender interest on the value of the securities borrowed. On March 19, 2004, the SEBI revised guidelines pertaining to securities lending and borrowing scheme. Under the new scheme, any investor can participate by depositing securities in the clearing corporation.
- 24. Rolling settlement system replaced the *badla* system from July 2, 2001. This concept is not new to the Indian stock market. The OTCEI was the first exchange to introduce rolling settlement when it started operations in 1992. Stock markets moved to the T+2 system from April 1, 2003. In a T+2 settlement, confirmation and determination of obligation takes place on a  $T+1$  basis, while pay-in and pay-out of funds and securities happens on the second day of trading.
- 25. The rolling settlement system of share transactions prevents speculations in between the settlement periods. Movement to T+1 system, requires real time gross settlement (RTGS) in banking transactions. For moving over to the  $T+1$  system, the SEBI has implemented a straight through processing (STP) system to prevent delays in share transfer from the buyer to seller. The STP system reduces the time gap between trading and settlement.
- 26. Margin trading permits investors to buy shares by providing 50 per cent of the deal value as 'margin,' while borrowing 50 per cent from banks. From April 2004, the SEBI has permitted brokers, banks, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) registered with the Reserve Bank, insurance companies and financial institutions to finance margin trading—borrowing money to part-finance stock purchases.
- 27. The stock market reforms were undertaken to have a positive impact on volatility, liquidity, size and transaction cost.
- 28. Volatility of a stock measures the frequency with which changes in its market price take place over a period of time. The stock markets were volatile in 2003–04 due to various factors such as uncertainty relating to formation of a new government, external factors relating to oil prices, huge activity in the F&O segment and rumours.
- 29. Liquidity is one of the most important indicators that greatly influences stock market development and efficiency. It is also one of the factors affecting the price discovery mechanism. When an investor is able to transact at a price close to the current market price in the stock market, the market is liquid.
- 30. There are two methods for measuring stock market liquidity—turnover ratio and value traded ratio. Turnover ratio equals the total value of domestic shares traded divided by market capitalization. Value traded ratio equals the total value of domestic shares traded on the major stock exchanges divided by the gross domestic product (GDP).
- 31. The market capitalization ratio measures the size of the stock market and equals the value of listed domestic shares (market capitalization) divided by the GDP.
- 32. Transaction costs substantially impact returns, volumes, and volatility. Low transaction costs can induce the investor to trade more often which would lead to increased volumes resulting in low volatility.
