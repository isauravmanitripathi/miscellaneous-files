# **Introduction**

Investment banks are financial intermediaries in the business of providing investment and financial advisory services to companies, governments and institutional investors. Investment banks issue securities on behalf of both public as well as private companies, trade securities in the primary and secondary markets on behalf of individual and institutional investors, manage portfolios for high net-worth clients and corporates, and provide financial advisory services to corporates, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit clients and institutional investors.

Investment banking differs from commercial banking in the sense that they do not accept deposits and grant retail loans. While commercial banks mobilize savings in the form of deposits and lend these funds to individuals, corporates and government, investment banks bring both the lender as well as the borrower together and help the lenders invest directly in the business of the borrowers. The services of commercial banks are accessible by all, while investment banks serve mainly the large companies and high net-worth individuals.

Investment banks were known as merchant banks in the United Kingdom. In the United States, a commercial bank could not undertake share broking or investment in shares till late 1990s. Because of the stock-market crash of 1929 and the high risk involved in the capitalmarket activities, the Glass–Steagall Act, 1933 prohibited commercial banks from undertaking investment banking. Hence, the stand-alone investment-banking model was born in the United States. The five big stand-alone investment banks, called 'bulge-bracket,' in the order of their establishment, were Lehman Brothers (1850), Goldman Sachs (1869), Merrill Lynch (1914), Bear Sterns (1923) and Morgan Stanley (1935). The Glass Steagall Act, 1933, was repealed by Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999. The commercial banks in the United States could undertake investment- banking activity and are now known as 'universal banks.' Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse are examples of Universal Banks. The acquisition of the merchant banks in the United Kingdom by the investment banks of the United States and the boom in the stock markets in the 1990s popularized the concept of investment banking. In India, commercial banks and financial institutions set up subsidiaries in 1972 to undertake this activity and it was known as 'merchant banking' till late 1990s. The ANZ Grindlays Bank was the first to set up a merchant-banking division in 1969 which offered issue-management services to corporates. With the advent of foreign-investment banks in India in the late 1990s, merchant banking started being referred as 'investment banking.' Merchant-banking activity comes under the purview of the SEBI and regulations have been framed to regulate the activities of merchant bankers.

# **Functions Of Investment Banks**

Investment banks perform two types of functions, as follows:

They help public as well as private corporates in issuing securities in the primary market, provide guarantee by standby underwriting and act as intermediaries in trading for clients. They help government in the disinvestment of public-sector enterprises.

They give companies advice on mergers and acquisitions (M&A)—both sell side as well as buy side, divestitures, corporate restructuring and spin-offs. They provide financial advice to investors and assist them in purchasing securities, managing financial assets and trading.

## **Types Of Investment Banks**

#### **Types of Investment Banks**

- Full service global investment banks
- Regional investment banks
- Boutique firms

There are three types of investment banks, which can be classified as:

*Full-service global-investment banks* which operate on a global basis and provide a complete set of services to their clients. These are large investment firms that serve large corporates, usually multinational corporations. Jefferies, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Kotak Investment Banking are some of the full-service investment banks.

*Regional-investment banks* concentrated in a particular region with specialized geographic knowledge and a variety of product offerings. These firms are also known as 'speciality investment banks.' For example, Piper Jaffray Companies is a leading, international middle-market investment bank and institutional securities firm serving the needs of middle market. Simmons & Company is the only independent investment bank specializing in the entire spectrum of the energy industry in Europe.

*Boutique firms* are small investment banks organized at a local level and specialize in a particular industry or product. They are independent firms whose focus is on advisory services such as M&A. Because of their expertise, they are better advisors in particular deals. They provide personalized services to their clients and try to be more of partners rather than merely being advisors. Avendus Capital, a boutique- investment-banking outfit in India, has carved a niche in the small and middle-market M&A space and private-equity transactions. Veda, a Chennai-based boutique-investment bank, provides advisory services in venture capital (VC), private equity (PE) and M&A, to emerging corporates and established groups in the manufacturing, technology, consumer products and services domains. Montague Partners is a boutique-investment bank founded in 1989 and headquartered in San Francisco. The firm works with privately-owned middle-market companies throughout the United States, in a range of industries, specializing in M&A and private placements of debt and equity.

# **Investment-Banking Services**

## **Fund-raising Services**

Investment banks help clients to raise funds through the following:

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs). Qualified Institutional Placements (QIPs). Rights Issues. Preferential Allotments. Foreign-Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs). Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).

The investment bank is an indispensable player in the success of the offering. It assists the issuer in a number of critical functions: analyzing the industry and company to determine if there is a demand with investors for such an offer, designing the offering, pricing the offering and marketing the offering to investors. The investment bank leads and directs the issuer's team of professional advisors and coordinates their roles to ensure that the funds are successfully raised.

## **Advisory Services**

#### *(a) Export and Project Finance*

*Export-credit Finance:* They provide both single- as well as multi-sourced export-credit facilities by developing relationships with many of the principal export-credit agencies in different countries.

**Project Advisory** They provide advisory services to governments, project sponsors, contractors and special-purpose project companies in a range of industrial sectors.

**Project-debt Arranging** They also deliver a range of debt products, including commercial bank debt, capital-market bonds, export credit, local-currency bank debt and multi-lateral agency debt.

**Forfaiting** They can structure and execute the non-recourse off-balance-sheet facilities worldwide using bills of exchange, letters of credit, guarantees and formal loan agreements.

## *(b) Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)*

Investment banks give M&A guidance regarding strategic alternatives, financial restructurings and ownership transitions. The package of services includes strategic advice, sell-side and buy-side advisory, divestitures, recapitalizations, management and leveraged buyouts, and capital raising. Their scope of services include undertaking of legal documentation in vertical and horizontal mergers such as scheme of amalgamation, notice to shareholders, resolutions, and preparation of documents to be filed with high court. They also perform valuation of the amalgamated and amalgamating companies with a view to arrive at the ratios of equity swaps. Investment banks provide both buy-side as well as sell-side advisory services as part of their M&A advisory offering.

**Buy-side Advisory** They work with clients who have identified particular acquisition targets and assist them in negotiation, structuring, due diligence, financing and documentation of the transaction.

**Phase 1: Target short-listing** In this phase, the investment banker helps the client prioritise among the targets to create a shortlist, based on the acquisition criteria, investment parameters, and complete market analysis. It also uses its network of relationships with companies, private-equity funds and other intermediaries extensively in this phase to identify the right targets.

**Phase 2: Preparing and executing term sheet** After the companies are short-listed, the investment banker creates valuation and structuring models for the short-listed companies, prepares the term sheet which outlines all commercial terms and conditions of the transaction, drives deal negotiations with targets and also ensures that the client enters into a term sheet with the target company.

**Phase 3: Due diligence and transaction closure** Acquisitions are risky. Due diligence is investigating the deal from a commercial, financial and legal view point to confirm to the client that he is getting what he thinks he is buying. It involves verification of assets and liabilities, identification and quantification of risks, and protection needed against such risks. In this phase, the investment banker helps the client on preliminary business, due diligence on the target, and coordinates the overall due-diligence process.

**Phase 4: Transaction closure** Once the due-diligence process is complete, the investment banker negotiates on the final agreement with the target company to close the deal in the defined time frame. It even arranges finance for the transaction, if required.

**Sell-side Advisory** The investment bank helps corporates in the sale of a minority interest, a majority interest, or 100% of the stock or assets of the company, by identifying the specific qualified buyers unique to each engagement, which may include private companies, public companies, private-equity funds, hedge funds and international buyers.

Sell-side engagements have the following phases:

**Phase 1: Collateral preparation** An investment banker prepares a complete packet of information based on the company's business profile and its own knowledge of the market, which enables the transaction to be presented in front of potential acquirers/partners in a structured way.

**Phase 2: Target short-listing** After a complete market analysis and identification of potential buyers, the investment banker helps the client decide on the kind of strategic partners who will be the right partner for the client, meeting the potential partners and helping the client prioritise among the strategic partners to create a shortlist. It uses its network of relationships with companies, private-equity funds and other intermediaries, extensively in this phase to identify the right partners.

**Phase 3: Preparing and executing term sheet** In this phase, the investment banker helps the client analyse the various offers from potential partners, drives deal negotiations with partners and ensures that the client enters into a term sheet with the partner company, which meets the client's strategic objectives.

**Phase 4: Due diligence and deal closure** In this phase, the investment banker helps the client in coordinating the overall due-diligence process, and negotiates on the final agreements with the potential acquirer to close the deal.

Investment banks assist the corporates in reverse mergers such as merger of an unlisted company with a listed company and merger of a healthy company with a sick company under the provisions of Section 72 of the Income Tax Act.

#### **Changing Landscape Of Investment Banking**

Investment banking was a lucrative business till 2007. The revenues during the year 2007 were the highest for the investment-banking industry as a large number of deals worth \$51 billion were struck. However, the subprime mortgage crisis took a toll on the global-investment banks. These investment banks were not under the control of either the Federal Reserve Bank or the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which made it easier for them to take higher risks. Wall Street's oldest and biggest investment banks collapsed in the late 2008 as a result of the financial turmoil. Bear Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan Chase in March 2008. Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and was declared bankrupt in September 2008. The Asian and European operations of Lehman Brothers were bought by Nomura and the North American Lehman operations by Barclays Capital. Merill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America for \$50 billion. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted themselves into bank-holding companies or commercial banks.

The impact of the collapse of these banks has been felt on the Indian investment banks. There will be a drop in big deals and fat fees and revenues. Even in the midst of this gloomy environment, investment banks have opportunities which they can tap with properly designed strategies and go global. The growth rate of the Indian economy has slowed down but it is fairly good when compared to the growth rate of the developed countries. Even though the capital markets are in a dismal state, India is still an attractive market for investment. Even foreign investment banks have planned to start their operations in India. The Indian investment banks need to design new strategies for survival and growth, such as focusing on key business areas, exploring new and alternate markets and market segments, creating alliances with boutique firms, developing strong and long-term relationship with the existing and new clients, giving quality advice to clients and assisting them in every stage of their growth, hiring qualified staff and promoting ethical behaviour.
