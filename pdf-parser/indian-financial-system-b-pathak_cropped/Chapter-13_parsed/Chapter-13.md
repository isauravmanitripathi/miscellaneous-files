# **Banking Institutions**

The banking sector is the lifeline of any modern economy. It is one of the important financial pillars of the financial system which plays a vital role in the success/failure of an economy. Banks are one of the oldest financial intermediaries in the financial system. They play an important role in the mobilization of deposits and disbursement of credit to various sectors of the economy. The banking system is the fuel injection system which spurs economic efficiency by mobilizing savings and allocating them to high return investment. Research confirms that countries with a well-developed banking system grow faster than those with a weaker one. The banking system reflects the economic health of the country. The strength of economy of any country basically hinges on the strength and efficiency of the financial system, which, in turn, depends on a sound and solvent banking system. A sound banking system efficiently deploys mobilized savings in productive sectors and a solvent banking system ensures that the bank is capable of meeting its obligation to the depositors. The banking sector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than half the assets of the financial sector.

Section 5(l)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act defines banking as 'the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise.' Section 5(l)(c) defines banking company as 'any company which transacts the business of banking in India'. However, the acceptance of deposits by companies for the purpose of financing their own business is not regarded as banking within the meaning of the act. The essential characteristics of the banking business as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act are as follows:

- Acceptance of deposits from the public
- For the purpose of lending or investment
- Repayable on demand or otherwise
- Withdrawable by means of any instrument whether a cheque or otherwise

From the definition, two important functions of commercial banks emerge: acceptance of deposits and lending of funds. For centuries, banks have borrowed and lent money to business, trade, and people, charging interest on loans and paying interest on deposits. These two functions are the core activities of banking.

# **Functions of Bank**

## **Deposits**

Deposits are the main source of funds for commercial banks. The amount mobilized as deposits is then lent in the form of advances. The higher the amount of deposits mobilized, the higher is the amount of funds lent. The growth of deposits depends on savings. Savings held in the form of currency or gold and jewellery are unproductive. For economic growth to take place, it is essential that these savings are mobilized and channelized for capital formation which, in turn, accelerates economic growth. Banks are important financial intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Banks mobilize savings by accepting deposits. Deposits may be categorized into: (i) Demand Deposits; and (ii) Time Deposits.

Demand deposits are deposits which can be withdrawn without notice and can be repaid on demand. Current accounts and savings accounts are classified as demand deposits.

Time deposits are deposits which are repayable after a fixed date or after a period of notice. Fixed deposits, recurring/cumulative deposits, miscellaneous deposits, and cash certificates are classified as time deposits.

A significant proportion of funds is contributed by deposits which account for more than 80 per cent liabilities of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs).

# **Credit Creation**

Banks are a special type of financial intermediaries which not only accept and deploy large amounts of uncollateralized deposits in a fiduciary capacity, but also leverage such funds through credit creation.

Banks are creators of credit. The creation of credit is an important function of a bank and this function distinguishes banks from the non-banking institutions. Banks create deposits in the process of their lending operations. When the bank mobilizes savings, it lends the amount that remains after providing for reserves. The amount lent is either deposited in the same bank or in some other bank. For instance, when a bank extends overdraft facility or discounts a bill of exchange, the bank first of all credits this amount in the account of the customer, who creates a deposit. The bank, after keeping aside a certain portion of this deposit in the form of reserves, lends this amount. This process continues and repeats in all the banks or in the banking system as a whole. This leads to the creation of credit, which, in turn, increases the liabilities and assets in the banking system.

For instance, a bank receives  $\bar{\tau}1,000$  in the form of deposits. The bank after keeping aside, say, 10 per cent in the form of reserves, lends the remaining amount, *i.e.*,  $\overline{\xi}900$ . The amount lent is either deposited in the same bank or in some other bank. The bank again, after keeping aside reserves of 10 per cent, lends the remaining amount, *i.e.*, ₹810. This process continues and repeats in all banks simultaneously leading to creation of credit. Credit creation leads to an increase in the total amount of money for circulation.

# **Lending of Funds**

Commercial banks mobilize savings from the surplus-spending sector and lend these funds to the deficitspending sector. They facilitate not only flow of funds, but also flow of goods and services from producers to consumers through this function of lending. Commercial banks facilitate the financial activities of not only the private sector, but also of the government. Funds are lent in the form of cash credit, overdraft, and loan system. Banks discount bills of exchange, give venture capital, and guarantees. Loans and advances form around 50 per cent of the aggregate deposits of SCBs.

## **Ancilliary Functions**

Besides the primary functions of mobilizing deposits and lending funds, banks provide a range of ancillary services, including transfer of funds, collection, foreign exchange, safe deposit locker, gift cheques, and merchant banking. Thus, banks provide a wide variety of banking and ancillary services.

Banks are distinct entities as they have fiduciary responsibility, are highly leveraged and the future of any one bank can threaten the integrity of the payments system which is the backbone of any modern economy.

## **Regulation of Banks in India**

Currently, the Banking Companies (Acquisition) Act, 1970 which is popularly known as the Bank Nationalization Act, and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, govern nationalized banks while the State Bank of

• Demand deposits are deposits which can be withdrawn without notice and can be repaid on demand. Time deposits are deposits which are repayable after a fixed date or after a period of notice.

India is governed by the State Bank of India Act, 1955, and the seven associate banks of the State Bank of India are governed by the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959. Private banks are covered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

## **Development of Banking in India**

The history of banking dates back to the thirteenth century when the first bill of exchange was used as money in medieval trade.

Banking in India has its origin in Vedic times, *i.e.*, 2000–1400 bc. Indigenous bankers and money lenders have played a vital role for centuries. Modern banking in India emerged between the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries when European agency houses erected a structure of European controlled banks with limited liability. In 1683, the first bank was set up in Madras by the officers of East India Company. The first joint stock bank was Bank of Bombay, established in 1720 in Bombay, followed by Bank of Hindustan in Calcutta, which was established in 1770 by an agency house. The principle of limited liability, which was first applied to joint stock companies in 1860, was a landmark in Indian banking.

The first 'Presidency bank'—the Bank of Bengal—was established in Calcutta on June 2, 1806 with a capital of  $\bar{\tau}$ 50 lakh to cater to the requirement for modern banking services, uniform currency to finance foreign trade and remittances by British army personnel and civil servants. The Government subscribed to 20 per cent of its share capital. The Bank of Bombay was the second Presidency bank set up in 1840 followed by the Bank of Madras in July 1843. As these banks were set up in the three Presidencies that were the units of administrative jurisdiction in the country for the East India Company, they were known as Presidency banks and were governed by Royal Charters.

Three presidency banks—the Bank of Bombay, the Bank of Madras, and the Bank of Bengal—which were set up between 1809 and 1843, were amalgamated into the Imperial Bank of India in 1921. The role of the Imperial bank was that of a commercial bank, a banker's bank and a banker to the government. The Imperial Bank of India eventually became the State Bank of India.

The cooperative banking movement had already evolved in India in the last decade of the nineteenth Century. The late Shri Vithal L Kavthekar pioneered the urban cooperative credit movement in the year 1889 in the then princely State of Baroda. The second urban cooperative bank was the Peoples' Cooperative Society in 1905 in Bangalore city in the princely State of Mysore. These banks catered to the requirements of urban lower income group population.

The *Swadeshi* Movement of 1906 provided a great thrust to set up joint stock banks of Indian ownership. The first Indian owned bank was the Allahabad Bank set up in Allahabad in 1865 followed by Punjab National Bank which was set up in 1895 in Lahore. Between 1906 and 1913, many Indian owned banks such as Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, and Bank of Mysore were set up. The major function of these banks was to finance foreign trade while domestic trade was largely handled by the Multani shroffs and moneylenders.

In 1930, there were 1,258 banking institutions registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.

Between 1928 to 1934, the period of Great Depression, a large number of small banks failed due to their loans going bad. To check the bank failures and to cater to the requirements of agriculture, the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 was enacted and the Reserve Bank of India was set up in 1935. There was an increase in the number of reporting banks with low capital base, after the Reserve Bank was set up. However, the Reserve Bank did not have adequate powers of control or regulation. Commercial banks were governed by the Company Law and the permission of the Reserve Bank was not required even for setting up of a new bank.

Between 1941 and 1945, the number of banks rapidly increased from 473 to 737 but these banks suffered from certain limitations such as inadequate capital structure and unsound methods of operations and management. Between 1947 and 1969, banks were under private ownership of the maharajas, or kings, of the princely states of India. These banks used to serve rich families and industrial houses and this narrowed the growth of banking system. To overcome these limitations, the government, in consultation with the RBI, enacted the Banking Companies Act in 1949 (later renamed as the Banking Regulation Act). The Banking Companies Act of 1949, the first regulatory step by the Government of independent India, gave extensive powers to the Reserve Bank for banking supervision as the central banking authority of the country. It included various powers such as protecting the interests of depositors, organization, management, audit and liquidation of the banking companies, control over opening of new banks and branch offices, powers to inspect books of accounts of the banking companies, and preventing voluntary winding up of licensed banking companies. Through elimination and mergers, the number of banking institutes was reduced. The RBI accelerated the task of consolidation in 1960, when the scope of the Banking Companies Act was widened. Between 1954 and 1966, 217 weak banks were either amalgamated or liquidated or their liabilities and assets transferred to other banks.

• Commercial banks together with cooperative banks account for nearly 70 per cent of the total assets of Indian financial institutions.

In order to enlarge the reach of banking services, the Government nationalized the Imperial Bank of India by converting it into the State Bank of India in 1955. The objective of nationalization was 'extension of banking facilities on a large scale, more particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas, and for diverse other public purposes'. The ownership of SBI was vested with the Reserve Bank which has now been transferred to the Government of India.

In order to ensure the safety of deposits of small depositors in banks in India, the Deposit Insurance Corporation Act, 1961 was enacted and the Deposit Insurance Corporation of India was set up in January 1962. The deposit insurance increased the trust of the depositors in the banking system which enabled higher deposit mobilization.

The number of bank branches rose significantly between 1951 and 1967, as a result of which the average population per branch fell from 1,36,000 in 1951 to 65,000 in 1969. Inspite of increase in number of branches, the rural population could not avail banking services on account of concentration of branches in urban areas, and a higher credit flow directed to industrial houses. To break the nexus between industrial houses and banks and improve the flow of credit to agriculture, the government once again used the tool of nationalization of major banks in the country.

In 1969, 14 banks were nationalized to promote macro-economic objectives such as economic growth, better regional balance of economic activities, and the diffusion of economic power. The nationalization was effected by an ordinance, which was later replaced by an act of parliament known as the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. The banking sector was identified as the key instrument for economic development. Fourteen erstwhile private sector banks were nationalized on July 19, 1969, and another six, viz, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, New Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Punjab and Sind Bank, and Vijaya Bank, with deposit liabilities of `200 crore and above in 1980. One of the objectives of nationalization was to extend the reach of organized banking services to rural areas and to the neglected sections/sectors of society. With a view to achieving these objectives, the policy makers imposed a strict credit rationing approach, prescribed formula-based lending and high-directed credit obligations.

The Reserve Bank also launched the Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) in December 1969, to mobilse deposits and to step up lending to weaker sections of the economy. Under this scheme, a 'lead bank' designated for the district was responsible for taking lead role in surveying the credit needs of the population, development of banking and of credit facilities in the district allotted to it.

Inspite of these measures, the commercial banks failed to cater the needs of rural people, especially the small and marginal farmers. The cooperatives also lacked resources to meet the requirements of small and marginal farmers. Hence, a separate banking structure known as the Regional Rural Banks was set up on February 9, 1976.

Between 1969 and 1992, there was a rapid expansion of branch network. The number of bank branches increased from 8,262 to 60,570, deposits rose from  $\overline{4}4,646$  crore to  $\overline{2}2,37,566$  crore, advances from  $\bar{z}3,599$  crore to  $\bar{z}1,31,520$  crore in 1991 reflecting a rapid growth of banking activity. The banking system spread to rural areas. Small-scale, tiny, and cottage industries, and small entrepreneurs benefited from the spread of the banking system. The significance of the informal (unorganized) sector declined with the spread of the banking system. The share of priority sector in the total banking grew. In 1969, 14 per cent of bank credit was apportioned to priority sectors whereas by 1990, this share had gone up to 43 per cent. Banking density improved from 64,000 people per branch in 1969 to just 14,000 people per branch in 1991 [Box 13.2 (A)]. India's gross domestic savings (GDS) rose from 15.7 per cent in 1970 to 24.20 per cent in 1991 and banking deposits grew at a rapid 19 per cent compounded annual growth rate. However, the government also had easy access and control over public funds. As banks were merely tools in the hands of the government, banks had no incentive to make profits and improve the financial health.

Nationalization killed competition and stifled innovations in banking. Trade unions became strong in banks with political patronage and they resisted any form of change in the banking system.

Banks functioned in a regulated environment with administered interest rate structure, quantitative restrictions on credit flows, fairly high reserve requirements, and pre-emption of significant proportion of lendable resources for the priority and the government sectors. These resulted in sub-optimal use of credit, low levels of investment and growth, decline in productivity, and erosion of profitability of the banking sector in general. The government realised the need to upgrade the operating standards, health, and financial soundness of banks to internationally accepted levels.

Although a series of reforms were undertaken from 1985 onwards, the first phase of comprehensive reforms in the banking sector was undertaken in June 1992 by implementing the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee I (1991) on the financial system. The recommendations of the committee were a fundamental departure from the then existing banking sector regulations. The major objective of the reforms was to create a viable and efficient banking system, which would thereby improve the productivity and efficiency of the financial sector. The major policy changes brought about emphasized deregulation and liberalization. The first phase of reforms focused on cleaning up bank balance sheets and bringing about greater disclosure and transparency in accounting. The RBI laid down clear policies for asset classification, income recognition, loan-loss provisioning, and investment valuation with mandatory compliance of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) capital adequacy standards.

The initial years of these reforms were very painful for banks. Twelve of the 27 public sector banks reported losses. The government had to infuse capital aggregating  $\overline{z}20,466$  crore over the period 1992–93 to 1998–99 to enable the banks to meet the prescribed capital adequacy standards. To overcome the crisis, the financially weak New Bank of India was merged with the large profitable Punjab National Bank in the early nineties. As a group, public sector banks turned around from a net loss position of 0.99 per cent of total assets in the fiscal year 1993 to a net profit position of 0.25 per cent of total assets in 1995. Two public sector banks, the State Bank of India and the Oriental Bank of Commerce, came out with their maiden initial public offerings (IPOs) which led to a dilution of government ownership in banks for the first time.

Competition was infused in the banking system for the first time in 1993 when the RBI granted permission to set up private sector banks and foreign banks were allowed to open branches. Despite competition, banks were in a position to post higher profits due to volume expansion and fewer poor quality loans.

The second phase of banking reforms is underway. The reforms aim to strengthen the banking sector through rigorous operational, prudential, and accounting norms, improvement in the credit delivery system and gradual narrowing of the divergences in regulatory framework of different types of institutions. It is expected that the Indian banking system will emerge as strong and efficient in the new millennium.

# **Scheduled Commercial Banks**

Scheduled commercial banks are those included in the second schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. In terms of ownership and function, commercial banks can be classified into four categories: public sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks in India, and regional rural banks. There are 84 scheduled commercial banks—21 public sector banks, 21 in the private sector, and 43 foreign banks (Figure 13.1).

RBI gave in-principle licences to 11 payments banks, out of which 3 backed out and in-principle licences to 10 small finance banks with the objective of deepening financial inclusion.

## **Public Sector Banks**

Public sector banks are banks in which the government has a major holding. These can be classified into two groups: (i) the State Bank of India and its associates; and (ii) nationalized banks.

**State Bank of India** The State Bank of India was initially known as the Imperial Bank. Imperial Bank was formed in 1921 by the amalgamation of three presidency banks—the Bank of Bengal, the Bank of Bombay, and the Bank of Madras. These presidency banks were created as a charter to deal in bills of exchange payable in India and were an integral part of the Indian treasury. They were taken over by the Imperial Bank of India as going concerns under a special legislation in 1920. The Imperial Bank acted as a banker to the government until the establishment of the RBI in 1935. Later on, it was authorized to act as the sole agent of the RBI in places where the latter did not have its own branches. The Imperial Bank was nationalized under the State Bank of India Act, 1955, which was passed on May 8, 1955.

The State Bank of India came into existence on July 1, 1955. This marked the beginning of the first phase of nationalization of banks. The main objective of nationalization was extending banking facilities on a large scale, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. The other objectives for which the bank was established were as follows:

- To promote agricultural finance and to remedy the defects in the system of agricultural finance.
- To help the Reserve Bank in its credit policies.
- To help the government to pursue the broad economic policies.

The State Bank of India had five subsidiaries:

- The State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur
- The State Bank of Hyderabad
- The State Bank of Mysore
- The State Bank of Patiala
- The State Bank of Travancore

The 107-year old State Bank of Saurashtra with 460 branches across the country was merged with the State Bank of India on September 15, 2008 and the State Bank of Indore was merged with the SBI on August 26, 2010.

The remaining five Associate Banks and Bharatiya Mahila Bank were merged with State Bank of India on 1st April 2017. This merger resultsin the first ever large-scale consolidation within the Indian banking industry and catapulted SBI, India's largest lender, into one of the Top 50 global banks. The Associate Banks involved were State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Hyderabad and the State Bank of Patiala.

The SBI is now amongst the world's largest banks, with a treasury pool of  $\bar{\mathcal{F}}9,01,642$  crore, with 24,017 branches and 59,263 ATMs.

The merged Bank caters to 42.04 crore customers, with a market share of 23.07 per cent and 21.16 per cent in Deposits and Advances, as opposed to 18.05 per cent and 17.02 per cent respectively before the merger.

Post merger, the State Bank of India has the ability to successfully process 15,000 transactions per second, versus actual utilisation of 4,600 transactions per second.

The number of foreign offices of SBI is 195, spread across 36 countries in all the continents and International Banking business has consistently been a major contributor to the business and profits of SBI.

It is a banker to India's top 250 companies. As on March 31, 2009, SBI has sponsored 14 RRBs covering 155 districts in 15 States, with a network of 3,977 branches. Its investment in equity of 14 RRBs is  $\overline{481.95}$  crore and its non-equity investment is  $\overline{423.62}$  crore. The SBI has twenty one non-banking subsidiaries: SBI Capital Markets Limited, SBI DFHI Limited, SBI Payment Services Private Limited, SBI Mutual Fund Trustee Company Private Limited, SBI Global Factors Limited, SBI Pension Funds Private Limited, SBI Funds Management Private Limited, SBI Cards & Payment Services Private Limited, SBI Life Insurance Company Limited, SBI-SG Global Securities Services Private Limited, SBI General Insurance Company Limited, C-Edge Technologies Limited, GE Capital Business Process Mgt. Services Private Limited, Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Management. Pte. Limited, SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Management Private Limited, SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trustee Private Limited, Oman India Joint Investment Fund Management Co. Private Limited, Oman India Joint Investment Fund Trustee Co. Private Limited, SBI Foundation, SBI Infra Management Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and JIO Payments Bank Ltd.

It has eight foreign banking subsidiaries: State Bank of India (California), SBI Canada Bank, CIBL Moscow, SBI Mauritius Limited, Bank SBI Indonesia, Nepal SBI Bank Limited, Bank SBI Botswana Limited and Bank of Bhutan Limited.

In October 1993, an ordinance leading to an amendment of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 was issued to enable the bank to access the capital market for funds. With a view to meeting capital adequacy norms, the State Bank of India raised funds through equity-cum-bond issue in 1993. The shareholding of the RBI in the equity of the bank came down from 98.2 per cent to 68.9 per cent after the issue. The State Bank of India raised funds from the capital market again in 1996 and the government ownership is now 59.41 per cent.

SBI has positioned itself as 'universal bank' catering to the diverse needs of the society, by converting its branches into 'super shoppe' selling all its products—banking, insurance, mutual fund, and credit cards.

# **Nationalized Banks**

In 1969, fourteen big Indian joint stock banks in the private sector were nationalized. The nationalization was effected by an ordinance which was later replaced by an act of parliament, known as the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. This was the second phase of nationalization. Six commercial banks in the private sector with deposits over  $\overline{z}200$  crore were nationalized on August 15, 1980—the third phase of nationalization. In all, 28 banks were nationalized from 1955–1980. At present, there are 27 nationalized banks: the State Bank of India and its six associates and 19 nationalized banks (New India Bank was merged with Punjab National Bank) and IDBI which is classified as other public sector bank. The major objectives of nationalization were to widen the branch network of banks particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas which, in turn, would help in greater mobilization of savings and flow of credit to neglected sectors such as agriculture, and small-scale industries.

With the amendment to the Banking Companies Act, public sector banks are now allowed to access the capital market to raise funds. This has led to a dilution of the shareholding of the government. In case of a nationalized bank, a ceiling of 20 per cent on all types of foreign investment in the paid-up capital has been stipulated in terms of the provisions of Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts, 1970–80.

Public sector banks have an edge over private sector banks in terms of size, geographical reach and access to low-cost deposits. Huge size enables them to cater to the large credit needs of corporates. Geographical reach through a large number of branches increases their access to low-cost deposits and lowers the portfolio risk through diversification. The access to low-cost deposits enables them to lend to the corporates at competitive rates. Low-cost deposits are current account and savings account deposits. Current account deposits earn no interest and hence are the cheapest and the most volatile source of funds for a bank. Savings account deposits are more stable than current account deposits but carry a higher interest rate of 3.5 per cent. But the effective cost of these deposits is about 3 per cent as interest is paid on the lowest balance between the 10th and 20th of each month and not the average balance mentioned. About 70 per cent of public sector bank branches are located in rural areas as against 25 per cent for new private sector banks.

The nationalized banks are a dominant segment in commercial banking. The bulk of the banking business in the country is in the public sector. Public sector banks have expanded their branch network and catered to the socio-economic needs of a large mass of the population, especially the weaker section and in the rural areas. Public sector banks dominate with 75 per cent of deposits and 71 per cent of advances in the industry.

• The RBI has defined internationally active banks as those banks which have crossborder business exceeding 20 per cent or 25 per cent of their total business.

## **Private Sector Banks**

For over two decades, after the nationalization of 14 larger banks in 1969, no banks were allowed to be set up in the private sector. In the pre-reforms period, there were only 24 banks in the private sector. The Narasimham Committee, in its first report, recommended the freedom of entry into the financial system. It stated that the RBI should permit the establishment of new banks in the private sector provided they conform to the minimum start-up capital and other requirements. The committee also recommended that there should not be any difference in treatment between the public sector and private sector and any restrictions in operation in this regard should be removed. The RBI considered the above recommendations and allowed banks to be set up in the private sector. The banks which have been setup in the 1990s taking into consideration the guidelines of the Narasimham Committee are referred to as new private sector banks. The RBI guidelines on entry of new private sector banks observed that while recognizing the importance and role of the public sector, there is increasing recognition of the need to introduce greater competition, which can lead to higher productivity and efficiency of the banking system.

Private Sector Banks means banks licensed to operate in India under Banking Regulation Act, 1949, other than Urban Co-operative Banks, Foreign Banks and banks established under specific Statutes.

Today, there are 21 private sector banks in the banking sector: 12 old private sector banks and 9 new private sector banks. These new banks have brought in state-of-the-art technology and aggressively marketed their products. These banks reported profits in the very first year of their existence. The public sector banks are facing a stiff competition from the new private sector banks. Pursuant to the guidelines issued in January 1993 the old private sector banks having networth of less than  $\overline{50}$  crore were advised to attain the level of  $\text{\textsterling}50$  crore by March 31, 2001, and prepare action plans for augmenting capital funds to the level of  $\overline{5}100$  crore.

The guidelines for entry of new banks in the private sector were revised in January 2001. The guidelines prescribed an increase in initial minimum paid-up capital from  $\bar{\tau}100$  crore to  $\bar{\tau}200$  crore. Moreover, the initial minimum paid up capital shall be increased to  $\overline{3}300$  crore in subsequent three years after commencement of business. The guidelines also enable a non-banking finance company (NBFC) to convert into a commercial bank, if it satisfies the prescribed criteria of (a) minimum net worth of  $\bar{\tau}$ 200 crore; (b) a credit rating of not less than AAA (or its equivalent) in the previous year; (c) capital adequacy of not less than 12 per cent; and (d) net NPAs not more than 5 per cent. The guidelines do not permit a large industrial house to promote any new bank. Individual companies, directly or indirectly connected with large industrial houses, are permitted to participate in the equity of a new private sector bank upto a maximum of 10 per cent, but would not have controlling interest in the bank. The guidelines also stipulate that preference would be given to promoters with expertise of financing priority areas and in setting up banks specializing in the financing of rural and agro-based industries. There are at present nine new private sector banks—the latest entrants are IDFC Bank and Bandhan Bank Ltd.

Norms for issue and pricing of shares were revised in 2001–02. Banks are free to price subsequent issues once their shares are listed on the stock exchanges but the RBI's prior approval would be necessary for initial public offerings (IPOs) and preferential shares. Bonus issues are now delinked from the rights issue. In case of issue of bonds and shares, banks will have to adhere to SEBI's guidelines. The level of foreign participation in private sector banks has been enhanced to strengthen the corporate governance, risk management, and technological competence of these banks. Some private sector banks have been successful enough to attract foreign capital.

Foreign investment in private sector banks is now permissible upto a composite ceiling of 74 per cent of the paid-up capital of the bank. This would include FDI, investments under Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) by FIIs, NRIs. However, the FII investment limit cannot exceed 49 per cent, within the aggregate foreign investment ceiling of 74 per cent of the paid-up capital and at all times, atleast 26 per cent of the paid-up capital would have to be held by residents.

New private sector banks to withstand the competition from public sector banks came up with innovative products and superior service. They tapped new markets such as retailing, capital markets, bancassurance and tie-ups with automobile dealers for vehicle finance. They accessed low-cost NRI funds and managed the associated forex risk for them. HDFC Bank, a private sector bank, had the lowest cost of deposits in 2003–04. It is the only bank with deposit cost less than 4 per cent. Not only do the new private sector banks have lower cost of deposits as compared with the PSU banks, but they also have been able to decrease their interest outgo on deposits by a higher margin in 2003–04.

Given the greater efficiency of private banks, public sector banks started loosing market share and have been doing so at about one per cent per annum.

• The banks which have been setup in the 1990s under the guidelines of the Narasimham Committee are referred to as new private sector banks.

## **New Private Sector Banks**

- Superior Financial Services
- Designed Innovative Products
- Tapped new markets • Accessed lowcost NRI
- funds
- Greater efficiency

In its recent draft guidelines on ownership in private banks, the RBI has proposed that no individual entity can hold more than 10 per cent stake in a private sector bank. The cross-holding among private sector banks (including foreign banks operating in India) is capped at 5 per cent. Together with the 10 per cent cap on voting rights, irrespective of the size of the holding, these limits would mean a premature end to foreign investment in India's private banks.

The RBI norms propose dispersing ownership of private sector banks for the following reasons:

- To cap private and foreign bank holdings at 5 per cent.
- To restrict banks and FIs from acquiring over 5 per cent in another bank's equity.
- To reduce the holding of banks and FI holdings over the stipulated limit to prudential limits.
- To restrict the investment of corporate entities, individual investors or a group of investors to 10 per cent.
- To restrict FDI by a single entity to 10 per cent.
- To ensure a minimum networth of  $\overline{\xi}300$  crore.
- The investment of 10 per cent of banks' capital funds in other banks to include equity shares, preference shares, hybrid debt capital investment and other approved instrument besides tier-II capital.

Holdings above this level would be subject to approval by the RBI. This restriction or stringent limits on ownership by one entity are proposed in the draft guidelines because banks are highly leveraged entities. With a relatively small amount of equity capital, private parties gain access to large amount of public funds. The temptation to take undue risk and to do so to benefit connected industrial entities is great when most of the risk is being borne by somebody else. As banks are central to the payment system, the entire system is exposed to risk.

The government is pressing ahead with its move to remove a major obstacle to enhancing foreign investment in private Indian banks—the restriction on voting rights to 15 per cent, whatever the scale of ownership. Many banks such as Citibank, Standard Chartered, HSBC, and ABN Amro can acquire upto a 74 per cent stake in Indian private banks and set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in India—this will facilitate inflow of FDI and expertise in the banking sector.

# **LEAD BANK SCHEME**

In 1969, the Reserve Bank of India implemented the recommendation of the Study Group headed by Prof. D. R. Gadgil. It was called the 'Gadgil Study Group', it was based on the organization framework for implementation of the social objectives. The Study Group found that the commercial banks did not have adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation and hence recommended an 'Area Approach' to evolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and credit structure in the rural areas. Later on, the Nariman Committee recommended that each public sector bank should concentrate on certain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.

The 'Lead Bank Scheme' is administered by the Reserve Bank of India since 1969. The scheme aims at coordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various forumsin order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to priority sector and other sectors and to promote the banks' role in overall development of the rural sector. For coordinating the activities in the district, a particular bank is assigned to the lead bank responsibility of the district. The lead bank is expected to assume leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and government.

Thisscheme has been useful in achieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit mobilization and lending to the priority sectors, especially in rural/semi urban areas.

The Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) has been extended to the districts in the metropolitan areas thus bringing the entire country under the fold of the 'Lead Bank Scheme'.

State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC)/Union Territory Level Bankers› Committee (UTLBC) acts as an apex level forum at State/Union Territory (UT) level and it coordinates the activities of the financial institutions and government departments in the State/Union Territory under the 'Lead Bank Scheme'. SLBC Convenorship is assigned to the banks for this purpose.

As on 30 June 2017, 25 public sector banks and one private sector bank have been assigned the lead bank responsibility in 706 districts of the country.

The effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the District Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the Regional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened with appropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for successful implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme.

## **LOCAL AREA BANKS**

These banks are set up in private sector to cater to the credit needs of the local people and to provide efficient and competitive financial intermediation services in their area of operation. The RBI issued guidelines for the setting up of local area banks in August 1996. The banks are registered as a public limited company under the Companies Act, 1956 and are issued licenses under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. They are also eligible for inclusion in the second schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The minimum paid up capital for such a bank is  $\overline{5}5$  crore and the promoters' contribution for such a bank is at least  $\bar{\tau}_2$  crore. The promoters of the bank may comprise individuals, corporate entities, trusts and societies. These banks are set up in district towns, and hence their focus of lending will on sectors like agriculture and its allied activities such as SSI, agro-industrial activities, trading activities and the non-farm sector with a view to ensure the provision of timely and adequate credit to the local clientele in the area of operation.

The area of operation of the bank should be limiting from a maximum of three geographically neighbouring districts and they are allowed to open branches only in their area of operation.The local area banks are subject to prudential norms, accounting policies and other policies as laid down by RBI. The banks have to achieve a capital adequacy of 9 per cent of the risk weighted assets and norms for income recognition, asset classification and provisioning are also applicable to them. The banks have to observe the priority sector lending targets at 40 per cent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) as applicable to other domestic banks. There are four local area banks operating in certain places such as Coastal Local Area Bank Ltd. in Andhra Pradesh, Krishna Bhima Samruddhi Local Area Bank Ltd. which operates in Mahbubnagardistrict of Andhra Pradesh, Gulbarga, and Raichur districts in Karnatakaand Subhadra Local Area Bank Ltd. in Kolhapur.

The profitability of these LABs is higher, but they remain a miniscule portion of the entire banking system (0.02 per cent of the asset size of SCBs). As these banks pose less threat to systemic stability given their limited area operations, the Reserve Bank has recommended the creation of small finance banks in the private sector as the assets of the erstwhile Capital Local Area Bank Ltd., which transformed into small finance bank on 24 April 2016 had a share of 74 per cent in the assets of all LABs, the significance of LABs as a bank-group has diminished further.

## **DIFFERENTIATED BANKING**

For deepening financial inclusion in India, the RBI set up a differentiated banking structure in the form of small finance banks and payments banks.

#### **SMALL FINANCE BANKS**

On 27 November 2014, the Reserve Bank of India issuedthe required guidelines that have to be followed for licensing of small finance banks in the private sector.

The key features of the small finance bank guidelines are as follows:

**(i) Objectives:** The objectives of setting up thesmall finance banks will be to further the financial inclusion by (a) provision of savings vehicles and (ii) supply of credit to small business units,small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and other unorganized sector entities, through high technology but low cost operations.

**(ii) Eligible promoters:** Resident individuals/professionals with 10 years of experience in banking and finance and companies and societies owned and controlled by residents will be eligible to set up small finance banks. The existing Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs), Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) and Local Area Banks (LABs) that are owned and controlled by residents can also opt for conversion into small finance banks. Promoter/promoter groups should be 'fit and proper' with a sound track record of professional experience or of running their businesses for at least a period of five years in order to be eligible to promote small finance banks.

**(iii) Scope of activities:** The small finance bank shall primarily undertake basic banking activities of acceptance of deposits and lending to the unserved and underserved sections including small business units, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries and unorganized sector entities.

There will not be any restriction in the area of operations of small finance banks.

(iv) Capital requirement: The minimum paid-up equity capital for small finance banks shall be  $\bar{\tau}100$ crore.

**(v) Promoter's contribution:** The promoter's minimum initial contribution to the paid-up equity capital of such small finance bank shall at least be 40 per cent and gradually brought down to 26 per cent within 12 years from the date of commencement of business of the bank.

**(vii) Prudential norms:** The small finance bank will be subject to all prudential norms and regulations of RBI as applicable to the existing commercial banks including requirement of maintenance of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). No forbearance would be provided for complying with the statutory provisions.

The small finance banks will be required to extend 75 per cent of its Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) to the sectors eligible for classification as Priority Sector Lending (PSL) by the Reserve Bank.At least 50 per cent of its loan portfolio should constitute loans and advances of up to  $\overline{5}25$  lakh.

**(viii) Transition path:** If the small finance bank aspires to transit into a universal bank, such transition will not be automatic, but it would be subject to fulfilling minimum paid-up capital/net worth requirement as applicable to universal banks; its satisfactory track record of performance as a small finance bank and the outcome of the Reserve Bank's due diligence exercise.

**(ix) Procedure for application:** In terms of Rule 11 of the Banking Regulation (Companies) Rules, 1949, the applications shall be submitted in the prescribed form (Form III) to the Chief General Manager, Department of Banking Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, 13th Floor, Central Office Building, Mumbai – 400 001. In addition to this, the applicants should furnish the business plan and other requisite information as indicated. Applications will be accepted till the close of business as on 16 January 2015. After gaining experience in dealing with small finance banks, the applications will be received on a continuous basis. However, these guidelines are subject to periodic review and revision.

# **Foreign Banks in India**

As at end March 2016, there were 43 foreign banks operating in India with 331 branches. In addition, 45 foreign banks were operating in India through representative offices. The Standard Chartered Bank leads the pack with 92 branches in India.

There are four main drivers of foreign banks presence in India, viz., (i) the desire of banks to follow their home customers abroad; (ii) the attractiveness of local profit; (iii) opportunities in the host countries, and (iv) the presence of mechanisms to mitigate information costs of doing business in foreign markets.

Foreign banks have been operating in India since decades. A few foreign banks have been operating in India for over a century. ANZ Grindlays had been in India for more than hundred years, while Standard Chartered Bank has been around since 1858. Many foreign banks from different countries set up their branches in India during the 1990s—the liberalization period. A total of 27 new foreign banks opened branches in India following the reforms of 1991, in addition to the 18 which were already operating in India.

Some of the foreign banks have set up different entities which are operating in India as subsidiaries in the form of either non-banking financing companies or limited companies in the non-financial sector in India that undertake diverse businesses such as dealing in securities, leasing and finance, and information and technology. Also, foreign banks have wholly-owned subsidiaries to run their global business process outsourcing jobs.

The presence of foreign banks in India has benefitted the financial system by enhancing competition, transfer of technology and specialized skills resulting in higher efficiency and greater customer satisfaction. They have also enabled large Indian companies to access foreign currency resources from their overseas branches in times of foreign currency constraint. They are active players in the money market and foreign exchange market which has contributed to enhancing the liquidity and deepening of these markets in terms of both volumes and products.

In terms of the Press Note No. 2 (2004 series) issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on March 5, 2004, the FDI limit in private sector banks was raised to 74 per cent under the automatic route including the investments made by foreign institutional investors. Foreign banks will be permitted to have either branches or subsidiaries not both. They may operate in India through any one of the three channels namely, (i) branch/es; (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary; or (iii) a subsidiary with aggregate foreign investment upto a maximum of 74 per cent in a private bank. If foreign banks convert their branch operations into subsidiaries they will be in a position to increase their reach through branch expansion but they will have to pay dividend tax and adhere to a higher priority lending requirement of 40 per cent of advances against the existing 32 per cent.

New foreign banks are allowed to conduct business in India after taking into consideration the financial soundness of the bank, international and home country ranking, rating, international presence, and economic and political relations between the two countries.

Foreign banks in India have to mandatorily lend 32 per cent of their adjusted net bank credit (net bank credit plus investments made by banks in non-SLR bonds held in held-to-maturity category) or credit equivalent of the off-balance sheet exposures, whichever is higher, as on March 31, of the previous year to the priority sector. The off-balance sheet items include guarantees, letters of credit, derivative and forex exposures. Foreign banks having shortfall in lending to the stipulated priority sector target and sub-targets will be required to contribute to the Small Enterprises Development Fund (SEDF), to be set up by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). Foreign banks having a shortfall in lending to priority sector target of 32 per cent on a pro-rata basis will contribute 50 per cent of the corpus. The remaining 50 per cent will be contributed by foreign banks having an aggregate shortfall in lending to the small scale industries (SSI) sector and exports sector of 10 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively.

A foreign bank which does not have a branch presence, can pick up a maximum of 10 per cent stake in a private bank. If the bank already has a presence in India, the maximum permissible stake is 5 per cent.

Foreign banks need to park 20 per cent of their profits from India operations with the RBI. These profits are kept as cash, as unencumbered approved securities or a combination of the two.

The Reserve Bank has put a 15 per cent cap on the extent of voting control that a foreign bank can enjoy in a domestic bank that it buys. This has put on par foreign owners of Indian banks with existing domestic investors (who already have such a voting cap). Parity is also sought to be introduced into ownership stipulations by increasing the extent of equity that a controlling Indian group can hold, from 49 per cent now to the 74 per cent.

#### **Foreign Banks in India**

- Enhanced competition
- State-of-the art technology
- Strong retail presence
- Active players in money market and foreign exchange market.

The foreign banks are keen on acquiring Indian banks but the cap of 15 per cent on voting rights imposed on private sector banks has hampered their plans. Moreover, present norms do not allow foreign banks to hold more than 15 per cent of the banking sectors' assets.

Foreign banks compete with new private banks rather than with public sector banks. While foreign banks have increased their business volumes, their growth has not kept pace with the rapid expansion by private Indian banks which have been giving them a run for their money. The foreign banks' share in the country's banking assets is 10.1 per cent. Their business figures do not include off-balance sheet items such as guarantees to corporates and interest rate and foreign currency derivatives which are a significant source of revenue for these banks. Their share in the aggregate off-balance sheet business of the Indian banking system was 63.8 per cent as on June 30, 2008.

Standard Chartered Bank is the undisputed leader among the foreign banks with assets of over `30,000 crore followed by Citibank which is a distant second. Stanchart has a network of about 80 branches which is fairly big compared to other foreign banks. Stanchart acquired Grindlays business in West Asia and South Asia in 2000. In India, ANZ Grindlays had 29 branches in 15 cities while StanChart had 19 branches in eight cities. The takeover of the business in India helped StanChart jump from the fifth place among foreign banks operating in India to the top of the chart, displacing Citibank. The deal helped StanChart becoming the leading bank in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and second in the U.A.E. Despite its British origins, the bank has evolved more as an Asian-oriented bank.

Foreign banks will compete not on size but ability under Basel III, to lower their requirements of regulatory capital by using sophisticated risk management practices.

Foreign banks such as Standard Chartered, Citibank and ABN Amro have a strong presence in the metros and most big cities of India.

Foreign banks that come under the eligible criteria are allowed to set up business in India by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The set-up can be established through a single mode of presence, i.e., either through branch mode or a Wholly OwnedSubsidiary (WOS) mode. Currently, the foreign banks have acquired its presence in India through its branches dispersed all over the country.

The Reserve Bank of India has now decided to issue licence to foreign banks only if they have established their branches in India by setting up wholly owned subsidiary. Setting up a subsidiary leads to a creation of separate legal entity with its own capital base and local board of directors. It also ensures that there is a clear demarcation between the assets and liabilities of the WOS and its parent bank. Moreover, the regulation of WOS also becomes easier for the regulator as it brings WOS on par with the domestic banks, thereby, enabling the protection of local retail depositors.

The Reserve Bank of India have made it mandatory for all foreign banks that has entered India after August 2010 to revamp their branches into wholly owned subsidiaries.

The guidelines also stipulate that the WOS would be given with capital gains tax and stamp duty benefits and allowed to acquire local private banks. The minimum capital requirement for setting up WOS would be as follows:

- a. The initial minimum paid-up voting equity capital for a WOS shall be  $\bar{z}$ 5 billion.
- b. The newly set up WOS of the foreign bank would be required to bring in the entire amount of initial capital upfront, which should be funded by free foreign exchange remittance from its parent bank.
- c. In case of any existing foreign bank that has its branch in India, that desires to be transformed into a WOS should follow the below criteria:
  - It should convert its branch capital into the capital of WOS. The components, elements and eligibility criteria of the regulatory capital instruments for the WOS would be as applicable to the other domestic banks as stipulated in the Basel III Capital Regulations.
  - It shall have a minimum net worth of  $\bar{5}5$  billion.
  - If the net worth upon conversion is less than the minimum capital prescribed under these guidelines, then the shortfall shall have to be brought in, towards the infusion of equity, upfront from its parent as inward remittance.
- d. The WOS shall meet the Basel III requirements on a continuous basis from the time of its entry/conversion. WOS shall, however, maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, on a continuous basis for an initial period of 3 years from the commencement of its operations, at 10 per cent, i.e., 1 per cent higher than that required under the phased implementation of Basel III. In addition to this, WOS shall also maintain capital conservation buffer and other buffers as applicable under extant capital adequacy framework.

Foreign banks like DBS Bank and SBM Bank (Mauritius), have opted to convert their branches into a subsidiary.

# **Branches of Indian banks abroad**

As on end March 2015, 15 Indian banks had overseas operations spread over 30 countries with a network of 183 branches (including offshore units), 7 joint ventures, 26 subsidiaries, and 56 representative offices. Out of these 15 banks, 12 are public sector banks and 3 are private sector banks. State Bank of India had the highest overseas presence with 52 branches, 4 subsidiaries, 1 joint venture banks, and 10 representative offices in 10 countries followed by the Bank of Baroda and Bank of India.

As against 331 branches of foreign banks present in India, Indian banks have only 183 branches overseas. Competition will make it imperative for banks to go global and enhance their systems and procedures to international standards. With Indian corporates going overseas and acquiring firms in developed markets, going global is not just an opportunity but a necessity for Indian banks as they will lose their customers to foreign banks if they do not follow them. The presence of Indian banks in foreign markets especially private sector banks has been growing at a much faster pace than the presence of foreign banks in India.

# **Setting up of off-shore Banking Units**

The phenomenal advances in telecommunications and the convergence of information technology have changed the structure of the banking system. Indian banks have increased exposure to international banking practices by setting up overseas branches. This cross-border diversification of assets and liabilities has increased the volume and nature of risks. Moreover, the international liabilities of banks in India have far exceeded their international assets making them vulnerable to external shocks.

Indian banks have been allowed to set up off-shore (overseas) banking units (OBUs) in special economic zones (SEZs). These OBUs operate virtually as foreign branches in India. Off-shore banking refers to banking operations that cover only non-residents and excludes domestic banking. These OBUs offer concessions in the form of lower taxes and levies. These OBUs are exempt from CRR and SLR requirements. The Reserve Bank has stipulated certain licensing conditions on OBUs. They can deal only in foreign currencies and certain restrictions on dealing with the Indian rupee and access to the domestic money market have been imposed on them. However, these OBUs are free from control of interest rates. They offer to the exporters the benefits of fine margins on loans and better forex rates. Some of them offer innovative products such as multi-currency fixed deposits, short-term forex loans and ECBs at internationally competitive rates.

The State Bank of India opened up the first off-shore banking unit at the SEERZ, Andheri, Mumbai in July 2003 and is planning to set up more units at Kochi, Kandla and Surat. During 2003–04, ten banks were given 'in principle' approval to open 14 overseas banking units (OBUs) in special economic zones (SEZs). Upto September 2006, seven OBUs have become operational out of which five are located in SEEPZ, Mumbai and one each in SEEPZ, Noida and Kochi. Of these, six banks including ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank have begun operations in different special economic zones.

## **Mobilization, Lending and Investment of Funds**

**Mobilization of funds** Banks depend on deposits and non-deposits to meet their resource requirements. Deposits constitute the largest source of funds for the banks. Banks mobilize deposits from the household sector, corporate sector, financial institutions, rest of world-non-resident (NRI) and foreign consulates and embassies-deposits, and government. Bank deposits from the government sector include deposits held by the local authorities, quasi government bodies including state electricity boards, and public sector corporations and commercial undertakings apart from the Central and State Governments.

Banks raise deposits in the form of time and demand deposits. Time deposits can be categorized into short, medium and long-term deposits. Demand deposits can be categorized into current deposits and savings deposits. The treatment of apportionment of savings deposits into two components—demand and time—was revised in March 1978. Scheduled commercial banks are required to treat the average of the monthly minimum balances in savings accounts eligible for interest payments as 'time' liability, while the remaining portion is to be treated as the 'demand' liability of the savings account. Banks calculate the proportions between 'demand' and 'time' liabilities twice a year as at end-June and end-December. Because of tax benefits on long term deposits, higher interest rates on deposit schemes for senior citizens, and strong deposit mobilization efforts by banks due to higher credit demand, banks have been in a position to mobilise higher amount of time deposits.

Certificate of deposits (CDs) are short-term time deposits, issued by banks during periods of tight liquidity at relatively higher discount rates as compared with term deposit rates. CDs provide greater flexibility to investors such as corporates, and financial institutions for investing their short-term surplus funds.

• Off-shore banking refers to banking operations that cover only nonresidents and excludes domestic banking.

- The ratio of total deposits-to-GDP which was 44% in 2000 increased to 74% in 2009.
- Retail deposits form a sizeable chunk of gross domestic savings.

Foreign deposits are mobilized through special deposit schemes designed for nonresidents by banks, in both foreign currency and local currency. Non-Resident External Rupee Account [NR(E)RA] was introduced for the first time in February 1970 which was followed by Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Account) [FCNR(A)] in November 1975 to tap the savings of Non-resident Indians (NRIs) employed in oil-rich countries. The FCNR(A) scheme, where foreign exchange risk was borne initially by the Reserve Bank and subsequently by the Government, was withdrawn in August 1994. A new scheme known as Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Bank) [FCNR(B)], in which the foreign exchange risk was borne by banks, was introduced. The FCNR(B) account can be opened by depositing foreign currency specified by the RBI in the form of term deposits only and is on a repatriable basis. The period of fixed deposit is minimum one year and maximum five years. In April 2002, a new NRE scheme known as the Non-resident External Rupee Account NR(E)RA scheme was introduced. The account is denominated in Indian rupees and is repatriable. Under this scheme, Savings, Current, Recurring, Fixed Deposit accounts can be opened. Ceilings on interest rates on NR(E)RA deposits and FCNR (B) deposits are linked to the LIBOR/SWAP rates and are reviewed from time to time, depending on monetary and macroeconomic developments. Another new scheme, Non-Resident Ordinary (NRO) Rupee Deposits account, similar to NR(E)RA, was introduced. In case of this scheme, banks are free to determine interest rates for term deposits. Since November 17, 2005, the interest rates on NRE saving deposits are the same as applicable to domestic savings deposits.

Banks raise non-deposit resources through public issues-both debt and equity-in the domestic capital market and borrowings both at home and abroad. Banks have raised large amount of funds from the capital market on account of sharp expansion of balance sheets, tightening of capital adequacy norms and increase in risks weights on certain categories of advances as a prudential measure to protect the balance sheets of banks during phases of rapid credit expansion. They have also raised long-term funds from the foreign capital markets in the form of ADRs/GDRs.

Banks raise short-term funds by borrowing in the call/notice money market, repo market, and CBLO market. Banks borrow from the Reserve Bank in the form of export credit refinance facility, financial institutions such as NABARD, EXIM Bank, and erstwhile IDBI by way of call/term funding and the rest of the world sector to tide over temporary mismatch between sources and uses of funds. Financial institutions constitute the main source of funds in the form of borrowings for banks.

Banks also resort to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and inter-bank borrowings in India and abroad to raise funds. Banks are allowed to tap foreign currency borrowings for granting pre-shipment credit in foreign currency (PCFC)/export bills rediscounting (EBR) to exporters and use funds generated through buy-sell swaps in the domestic foreign exchange markets for granting such loans, subject to aggregate gap limit approved by the Reserve Bank. Banks have to put in place a system of appropriate risk management as borrowings are exposed to interest rate and exchange rate risks.

**Lending of funds** Lending or the extension of credit is the major activity of a commercial bank. Banks in India have traditionally been the main source of credit for small borrowers and various sectors of the economy such as agriculture, industry, infrastructure, services and government. Prior to the early 1990s, the lending by banks was directed according to plan priorities. In the post-reforms period, bank lending is determined by both supply and demand factors. Banks now strive to earn highest return on their portfolio with minimum risk. Their portfolio consists of four categories of assets, *viz.,* cash in hand and balances with the central bank; assets with the banking system; investments in Government and other approved securities; and loans and advances. Among these, loans and investments are the two most important assets which can earn higher rates of return.

**Lending to Agriculture** Banks provide short-term credit for seasonal agricultural operations such as crop cultivation and long-term credit for creation of assets such as, purchase or replacement of tractors and farm equipment, installing diesel pump sets or electric motors, laying cement pipelines/field channels and drip/sprinkler irrigation system, construction of farm sheds, purchase of produce transport vehicles, dairy animals and so on. Banks provide both direct and indirect finance for agriculture. Direct finance is agricultural credit advanced directly to the beneficiary/borrower by institutions such as cooperatives, scheduled commercial banks (including regional rural banks) and State Governments. Indirect finance comprises loans advanced for storage and market yards and for setting up of other agricultural allied activities and is routed through some other agency.

The credit flow to agriculture was high between 1950 and 1980 but it declined during 1990s. However, there was an upward trend in credit flow to agriculture since 2003–04 on account of policy initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Government to increase the flow of credit to agriculture. The credit flow has been below the priority sector target of 18 per cent for agriculture since early 1990s. Banks perceive high risks in lending to agriculture sector on account of various factors such as dependency of

- Through public issues in the capital market.
- By borrowing in the call/notice money market, repo market and CBLO market.
- Through private placement
- Through ECBs and inter bank borrowings.

## **Lending of Funds by Banks**

- Lending to Agriculture
- Lending to Priority Sector
- Lending to industry

- Lending to sensitive sectors
- Financing of NBFCs
- Financing to factoring companies

agriculture on vagaries of monsoon, lack of clear and secure land titles for mortgage, lack of knowledge of instruments for managing systemic risks such as crop insurance, irrigation or price risk.

The public sector banks are required to formulate special agricultural credit plans (SACP) to enhance flow of credit to the agriculture sector. Under SACP, banks fix targets for achievement during the financial year. Banks also issue Kisan Credit Cards to farmers which enable them to purchase agricultural inputs and draw cash for their production needs.

Lending to Priority Sector In order to ensure that the bank credit flowed to the vital sectors of the economy and according to national priorities, the concept of priority sector lending was developed. Based on the report submitted by the Informal Study Group on Statistics Relating to *A*dvances to the Priority Sectors, three sectors-agriculture, exports and small industries were identified as priority sectors. The Reserve Bank prescribed a modified return for reporting priority sector advances and certain descriptive guidelines without stipulating any ceilings in February 1972. The scope and extent of priority sector has been modified since then with several new areas and sectors being brought within the purview of this sector taking into account the structural changes in the economy.

The priority sector norms were revised in April 2007. The priority sector definition was streamlined to include only those sectors that impact large and weaker sections of the population and which are employment-intensive such as agriculture, and tiny and small enterprises. The broad sectors under the revised norms include agriculture (both direct and indirect), small enterprises (direct and indirect), retail trade in essential commodities and consumer cooperatives stores, micro credit, education loans, and housing loans.

The guidelines on priority sector were revised by the RBI in April 2015 and December 2016 which are stated below.

Additionally, the domestic banks are directed to ensure that the overall lending to non-corporate farmers does not fall below the system-wide average of the last three years achievement. All efforts should be maintained to reach the level of 13.5 per cent direct lending to the beneficiaries who earlier constituted the direct agriculture sector. The applicable system wide average figure for computing achievement under priority sector lending will be notified every year. For the financial year2016 to 2017, the applicable system wide average figure is 11.70 per cent.

(ii) The total priority sector target of 40 per cent for foreign banks with less than 20 branches has to be achieved in a phased manner as given below:-

| <b>Financial Year</b> | The total priority sector as percentage of ANBC or credit equivalent<br>amount of off-balance Sheet exposure, whichever is higher |

The additional priority sector lending target of 2 per cent of ANBC each year from 2016-17 to 2019-20 has to be achieved by lending to sectors other than exports. The sub targets for these banks, if to be made applicable after2020, would be decided in due course.

(iii) The computation of priority sector targets/sub-targets achievement will be based on the ANBC or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposures, whichever is higher, as on the corresponding date of the preceding year. For the purpose of priority sector lending, ANBC denotes the outstanding bank credit in India minus bills rediscounted with RBI and other approved financial institutions plus the permitted non-SLR bonds/debentures under Held to Maturity (HTM) category plus other investments eligible to be treated as part of priority sector lending (For e.g., investments in securitized assets). The outstanding deposits under RIDF and other funds with NABARD, NHB, SIDBI and MUDRA Ltd. in lieu of nonachievement of priority sector lending targets/sub-targets will form a part of ANBC. Advances extended in India against the incremental FCNR (B)/NRE deposits, qualifying for exemption from CRR/SLR requirements, will be excluded from the ANBC for computation of priority sector lending targets, till their repayment.

*\** For the purpose of priority sector computation only. Banks should not deduct/totalize any amount like provisions, accrued interest, etc., from NBC.

It has been observed that some banks are subtracting prudential write off at corporate/head office level while reporting thebank credit as above. In such cases it must be ensured that the bank credit to priority sector and all other sub-sectors should be so written off or subtracted category-wise from the priority sector and sub-target achievement.

All types of loans, investments or any other items which are treated as eligible for classification under priority sector target/sub-target achievement should also form part of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC).

  - ii. Loan does not exceed  $\text{\textless}60,000/$  in the first cycle and  $\text{\textless}100,000/$  in the subsequent cycles.
  - iii. Total indebtedness of the borrower does not exceed  $\bar{\tau}1,00,000/$ -.
  - iv. Thetenure of loan is not less than 24 months when the loan amount exceeds  $\bar{\mathfrak{F}}30,000/$  with the right to borrower of prepayment without penalty.
  - v. The loan is without collateral.
  - vi. Loan is repayable by weekly, fortnightly or monthly instalments at the choice of the borrower.
- c. Further, the banks have to ensure that MFIs comply with the following caps on margin and interest rate as also other 'pricing guidelines', to be eligible to classify these loans as priority sector loans.
  - i. Margin cap: The margin cap should not exceed 10 per cent for MFIs having loan portfolio exceeding  $\bar{\mathfrak{Z}}$ 100 crore and 12 per cent for others. The interest cost is to be calculated on average fortnightly, the balances of outstanding borrowings and interest income is to be calculated on average fortnightly balances of outstanding loan portfolio of qualifying assets.
  - ii. Interest cap on individual loans: With effect from 1 April 2014, the interest rate on individual loans will be the average base rate of five largest commercial banks by assets multiplied by 2.75 per annum or cost of funds plus margin cap, whichever is less. The average of the base rate shall be advised by Reserve Bank of India.
  - iii. Only three components are to be included in pricing of loans such as (a) a processing fee not exceeding 1 per cent of the gross loan amount, (b) the interest charge and (c) the insurance premium.

- iv. The processing fee is not to be included in the margin cap or the interest cap.
- v. Only the actual cost of insurance, i.e.,the actual cost of group insurance for life, health and livestock for borrower and spouse can be recovered; administrative charges may be recovered as per IRDA guidelines.

- d. The banks should obtain from MFI, at the end of each quarter, a Chartered Accountant's certificate stating, inter-alia, that the criteria on (i) qualifying assets, (ii) the aggregate amount of loan, extended for income generation activity and (iii) pricing guidelines are followed.

**21. Non-achievement of Priority Sector targets** Scheduled commercial banks having any shortfall in lending to priority sector shall be allocated amounts for contribution to the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) established with NABARD and other funds with NABARD/NHB/SIDBI/ MUDRA Ltd., as decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time. The achievement will be arrived at the end of financial year based on the average of priority sector target/sub-target achievement as at the end of each quarter.

The interest rates on banks' contribution to RIDF or any other funds, the tenure of deposits, etc., shall be fixed by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time.

**22. Priority Sector Lending Certificates** The Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs) scheme introduced by the Reserve Bank in April 2016 provides for the purchase of these instruments by banks in the event of a shortfall in their achievement of PSL targets/sub-targets. It simultaneously incentivizes surplus banks by making available a mechanism to sell their over-achievement thereby enhancing or lending to the categories under the priority sector. The PSLC mechanism does not involve the transfer of credit risk or underlying assets.

Four types of PSLCs such asgeneral, agriculture, small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises can be bought/ sold by banks. The entities eligible for trading in PSLCs include public sector banks, private sector banks, regional rural banks, urban co-operative banks and small finance banks.

Banks have been provided with an online anonymous trading platform through the Reserve Bank's Core Banking Solution (CBS) portal called e-Kuber for trading in PSLCs. PSLCs have a standard lot size of  $\bar{\mathfrak{T}}2.5$  million or multiples thereof and are valid till the end of the financial year, i.e., March 31, irrespective of the date of issuance. The total volume traded at the end of September 2016 was about ₹140 billion.

Lending to Industry Banks finance both short-term working capital and long-term requirements of industry. Banks lend to both large and small enterprises. An 'enterprise' means an industrial undertaking or a business concern or any other establishment, by whatever name called, engaged in the manufacture or production of goods, in any manner, pertaining to any industry specified in the First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 or engaged in providing or rendering of any service or services. Large corporates rely on both internal such as retained earnings and external sources of funds such as equity and borrowings to finance their short-term and long-term capital requirements. Within external sources, bank credit is the preferred source of finance.

The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 has defined micro, small, and medium enterprises. (a) In the case of the enterprises engaged in the manufacture or production of goods pertaining to any industry specified in the first schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, (i) a micro enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery does not exceed  $\overline{z}$ 25 lakh; (ii) a small enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than  $\overline{z}25$  lakh but does not exceed  $\overline{z}5$  crore; or (iii) a medium enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than  $\bar{\tau}$  crore but does not exceed  $\bar{\tau}$ 10 crore; (b) In the case of the enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services, (i) a micro enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in equipment does not exceed  $\bar{\tau}10$  lakh; (ii) a small enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than  $\bar{\tau}10$  lakh but does not exceed  $\bar{\tau}2$  crore; or (iii) a medium enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than  $\overline{z}2$  crore but does not exceed  $\overline{5}$  crore.

Banks have conventionally lended to large enterprises. It is sometimes assumed that large firms constitute the main drivers of economic activity. Small is not only beautiful but is also indispensable. The importance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to Indian economy is indisputable. The share of SMEs was over 40 per cent of total value added in the economy and about 33 per cent of total exports. With the economy booming, the number of SMEs are growing by leaps and bounds. In order to grow big, SMEs need to build economies of scale to achieve cost competitiveness. A large number of SMEs lack financial muscle. They require financial support to truly become 'agents of change'. The credit extended to SMEs has gone down in relation to credit to industry and other sectors. These enterprises are varied and large in number which requires different lending and risk management techniques, processes, and skills. Moreover, lack of reliable information about them, inability to provide adequate collateral, and lack of credit history have made it difficult for banks to lend funds to them. Recognizing the importance of SMEs, many banks have taken initiatives such as setting up a special cell for SMEs and simplified loan products for improving credit flow to SMEs. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has floated a rating agency SMERA for the SME segment.

**Infrastructure financing** Banks also finance infrastructure projects by way of term loans, bonds and guarantees. Prior to 2002–03, DFIs were the major source of finance for infrastructure projects. Since 2002–03, with an increase in public-private-partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure, banks have been the preferred source of finance. In order to facilitate financing of infrastructure projects, banks are allowed to exceed exposure norm of 40 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 10 per cent (*i.e.,* up to 50 per) in case of credit exposure of borrowers belonging to a group and the exposure norm of 15 per cent of the bank's capital funds by an additional 5 per cent (*i.e.* up to 20 per cent) in case of credit exposure to single borrower. Banks are also allowed to assign a concessional risk weight of 50 per cent for capital adequacy purposes, on investment in securitized paper relating to an infrastructure facility provided it generates income/cash flows which would ensure servicing/repayment of the securitized paper.

For funding large infrastructure projects, banks also syndicate loans-in which different banks come forward to share the loan amount. Banks also lend to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the private sector, registered under Companies Act for directly undertaking infrastructure projects. Banks extend credit facility by way of working capital finance, term loan, project loan, subscription to bonds and debentures/ preference shares/equity shares acquired as a part of the project finance package which is treated as 'deemed advance' and any other form of funded or non-funded finance facility. Banks are permitted to issue guarantees favouring other lending institutions in respect of infrastructure projects, provided the bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent of 5 per cent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project. Credit exposure of banks is the highest in power and telecommunication sectors.

**Lending to the household sector** Banks lend funds to the household sector in the form of housing loans, auto loans, advances to individuals against fixed deposits, credit card, educational loans and loans for purchase of consumer durables. These are categorized as retail loans as the average size of loans is very small and loans are widely distributed over a large number of borrowers. During the first phase of banking reforms, banks were given freedom to decide the quantum, rate of interest, margin requirement, repayment period and other related conditions of retail loans which enabled banks to aggressively market retail loans. Increased job opportunities, rising income levels, higher tax incentives to salaried class, boom in the real estate sector, and technological innovations such as ATMs led to a higher demand for consumer durables and housing which, in turn, led to a sharp growth of retail loans. Because of low risk, adequate collaterals, and higher returns, banks expanded their retail portfolio. Retail loans are the prime drivers of credit growth.

• Banks exposure to capital market includes loan against shares, direct investment in equity and mutual funds, and advances and guarantees to brokers.

**Lending to the Sensitive Sectors** Scheduled commercial banks have exposure to sensitive sectors such as real estate, capital market, and commodities. Banks' exposures to commercial real estates include shopping malls, office buildings, warehouses, hotels and land acquisition, development, and construction. Banks' exposure to capital market includes loan against shares, direct investment in equity and equity mutual funds, advances against shares/bonds/debentures or other securities or on clean basis to individuals for investment in shares (including IPOs/ESOPs), convertible bonds, convertible debentures, and units of equity-oriented mutual funds etc., advances for any other purposes where shares or convertible bonds or convertible debentures or units of equity oriented mutual funds are taken as primary or collateral security, secured and unsecured advances to stockbrokers and guarantees issued on behalf of stockbrokers and market makers, loans sanctioned to corporates against the security of shares/bonds/debentures or other securities or on clean basis for meeting promoter's contribution to the equity of new companies in anticipation of raising resources, bridge loans to companies against expected equity flows/issues, underwriting commitments taken up by the banks in respect of primary issue of shares or convertible bonds or convertible debentures or units of equity oriented mutual funds, financing to stockbrokers for margin trading, all exposures to Venture Capital Funds (both registered and unregistered) and intra-day exposures.

**Exposure Limits** The RBI has prescribed regulatory limits on banks' exposure to individual and group borrowers in India to avoid concentration of credit.
**A. Individual Basis:** The aggregate exposure of a bank to the capital markets in all forms (both fund based and non-fund based) should not exceed 40 per cent of its net worth as on March 31 of the previous year. Within this overall ceiling, the bank's direct investment in shares, convertible bonds/ debentures, units of equity-oriented mutual funds and all exposures to Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) [both registered and unregistered] should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth.

**B. Consolidated Basis** The aggregate exposure of a consolidated bank to capital markets (both fund based and non- fund based) should not exceed 40 per cent of its consolidated net worth as on March 31 of the previous year. Within this overall ceiling, the aggregate direct exposure by way of the consolidated bank's investment in shares, convertible bonds / debentures, units of equity-oriented mutual funds and all exposures to VCFs ([both registered and unregistered)] should not exceed 20 per cent of its consolidated net worth.

The above-mentioned ceilings are the maximum permissible and a bank's Board of Directors is free to adopt a lower ceiling for the bank, keeping in view its overall risk profile and corporate strategy. Banks are required to adhere to the ceilings on an ongoing basis.

**Financing of NBFCs** Banks extend need based working capital facilities as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI and engaged in equipment leasing, hire-purchase, loan, factoring and investment activities. Banks also extend finance to NBFCs against second hand assets financed by them. Bills discounted/rediscounted by NBFCs (which is deemed to include any other mode of financing of receivables of the borrowers), except those arising from sale of certain types of vehicles, are not eligible for bank finance. Further, the unsecured loans extended by the NBFCs to other companies are also ineligible for bank finance.

**Finance to Factoring Companies** Banks can extend financial assistance to support the factoring business of Factoring Companies which comply with the following criteria:

- 1. The companies qualify as factoring companies and carry out their business under the provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Notifications issued by the Reserve Bank in this regard from time to time.
- 2. They derive at least 75 per cent of their income from factoring activity.
- 3. The receivables purchased/financed, irrespective of whether on 'with recourse' or 'without recourse' basis, form at least 75 per cent of the assets of the Factoring Company.
- 4. The assets/income referred to above would not include the assets/income relating to any bill discounting facility extended by the Factoring Company.
- 5. The financial assistance extended by the Factoring Companies is secured by hypothecation or assignment of receivables in their favour.

# **Investments Of Banks**

## **Investments in SLR Securities**

Commercial banks invest in two types of securities: SLR securities and non-SLR securities. **Investment in SLR securities**: Investment of banks in government securities and other approved securities is categorized as SLR investments. Banks are required to invest a prescribed minimum of their net demand and time liabilities in Government and other approved securities under the BR Act, 1949.

Scheduled commercial banks were holding SLR securities of around 28 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) during June 2017 as compared to the required 20 per cent. Banks SLR investments have gradually came down from a peak of 42.7 per cent of NDTL on April 16, 2004 to 28 per cent in June 2017. Banks are now exposed to market risks on their debt investment portfolio held in excess of regulatory requirement. Strategies to minimize this risk include reducing the excess investment portfolio and increase their lending, lowering the portfolio duration and using interest rate derivatives.

The entire investment portfolio of banks (including SLR securities and non-SLR securities) is classified under the three categories of 'Held to maturity', 'Available for sale' and 'Held for trading'. Indian banks are permitted to classify a maximum of 25 per cent of their investments portfolio in the category held to maturity (HTM) which is carried at book value and is not required to be valued on marked-to-market (MTM) basis. Bonds in HTM are not marked-to-market and therefore no provision has to be made on HTM securities following a fall in prices (or rise in interest rates). However, bonds in the available for sale (AFS) category and the held for trading (HFT) category have to be marked-tomarket. Thus, a bank can avert a higher provisioning and a possible loss by transferring more gilts to the HTM category. Banks have to classify their investment securities into this category in the first quarter of the financial year and subsequent changes to the

#### **Investments of Banks**

- Investment in non-SLR securities

#### SLR Ratio: 20 percent

The Banking Regulation Act 1949, has been amended whereby the floor rate of 25 per cent for SLR has been removed. classification are not allowed during the year. Bonds in the 'Available for sale' category will be marked-tomarket at the year-end or at more frequent intervals. The bonds in the `Held for trading' will be revalued at monthly or at more frequent intervals. The market value for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments included in the 'Available for sale' and 'Held for trading' would be the market price of the scrip as available from the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges, price of SGL transact ions and price list of RBI.

The RBI had earlier advised banks to gradually build up on their investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) of upto 5 per cent of their HFT and AFS investment portfolio to help manage interest rate risks. IFR is treated as tier I capital, and banks have transferred their entire IFR balances to General Statutory Reserve.

Indian Banks need a large amount of capital over the next five years to maintain regulatory capital commensurate with the expected 25–30 per cent credit growth in this period. The stronger banks can use their investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) or reduce their excessive provisioning of the past few years to remain adequately capitalized. But the weaker banks need to raise capital by offering equity shares as they do not have the options enjoyed by the stronger banks.

### **Investments in Non-SLR Securities**

In 1985, the domain of eligible investments of SCBs was enlarged to cover commercial paper (CP), units of mutual funds, shares and debentures of public sector undertakings (PSUs) and private corporate sector, which are all known as non-SLR investments.

The RBI also issued guidelines in November 2003 relating to banks' investment in non-SLR securities to contain the risk arising out of non-SLR investment portfolio. These guidelines cover banks' investment in non-SLR securities issued by corporates, banks, FIs and State and central government sponsored institutions, and SPVs. The guidelines apply to investments both in the primary as well as secondary market.

According to the guidelines, banks' investment in unlisted non-SLR securities should not exceed 10 per cent of its total investment in non-SLR securities as on March 31, of the previous year. The unlisted non-SLR securities in which banks may invest up to the limits specified above, should comply with the disclosure requirements as prescribed by the Sebi for listed companies. Furthermore, banks' investment in unlisted non-SLR securities may exceed the limit of 10 per cent, by an additional 10 per cent, provided the investment is on account of investment in securities issued by special purpose vehicles for mortgagebacked securities (MBS), securitization papers issued for infrastructure projects and bonds, debentures, security receipts, pass-through certificates issued by securitization companies and reconstruction companies set up under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (2002) and registered with RBI.

Investment in the following will not be reckoned as 'unlisted non-SLR securities' for computing compliance with the prudential limits:

- Security Receipts issued by SCs/RCs registered with the Reserve Bank.
- Investment in Asset Backed Securities (ABS) and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), which are rated at or above the minimum investment grade. However, there will be close monitoring of exposures to ABS on a bank specific basis based on monthly reports submitted to the Department of Banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, under the Supervisory Reporting System.
- Investments in unlisted convertible debentures. However, investments in these instruments would be treated as "Capital Market Exposure".

The majority of the banks' non-SLR investments are in bonds and debentures and commercial paper.

The SCBs' non-SLR investments constitute a small percentage of 5.5 per cent of their total assets.

# **Reforms In The Banking Sector**

Banking sector reforms were initiated to upgrade the operating standards, health, and financial soundness of banks to internationally accepted levels in an increasingly globalized market. The Government of India set up the Narasimham Committee (1991) to examine all aspects relating to structure, organization, and functioning of the Indian banking system. The recommendations of the committee aimed at creating a competitive and efficient banking system. Measures like capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification, norms for investment, entry of private sector banks, gradual reduction of SLR and CRR were recommended and implemented to strengthen the banking system. These recommendations changed the face of Indian Banking. Public sector banks faced a stiff competition with the entry of private sector banks.

Another committee which deserves mention is the Khan Committee, which was constituted by the RBI in December 1997 to examine the harmonization of the role and operations of development financial institutions (DFIs) and banks. It submitted its report in April 1998. The major recommendations of the committee were a gradual move towards universal banking; exploring the possibility of gainful mergers between banks; banks and financial institutions; encompassing both strong and weak entities or two strong ones; developing a function-specific regulatory framework and a risk-based supervisory framework; establishment of a super-regulator to supervise and coordinate the activities of multiple regulators; speedy implementation of legal reforms to hasten debt recovery; reducing CRR to the international standards; and phasing out SLR.

The Verma Committee, which had been the most controversial of committees, recommended the need for greater use of information technology (IT) even in the weak public sector banks; restructuring of weak banks but not merging them with strong banks; market-driven mergers ; sale of foreign branches; closure of subsidiaries of weak public sector banks, and voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for at least 25 per cent of the staff.

The banking sector reforms aimed at improving the policy framework, financial health, and institutional infrastructure. Improvement in the policy framework has been undertaken by reducing the reserve requirements, changing the administered structure of lending rates, enlarging the scope of priority sector lending and linking the lending rates with the size of advances. Efforts have been made to improve the financial health of the banking sector by prescribing prudential norms. Improvement in the institutional framework has been sought through recapitalization, infusing competition, and strengthening of supervisory system.

The chief merit of the reform process is that the reform measures were undertaken and implemented gradually and cautiously. The first phase of the banking reforms is complete and the second generation reforms are under way. The second generation reforms are those that did not form part of the first generation reforms but needed to be prioritized in the agenda for the next decade. Many of the important recommendations of Narasimham Committee II have been accepted and are under implementation. The second generation banking reforms concentrate on strengthening the foundation of the banking system by structure, technological upgradation, and human resource development.

The second phase of reforms aims to further strengthen the banking sector and to move towards international best practices in areas relating to banking policy, institutional, supervisory, and legislation.

# **Banking Sector Reforms**

**Phase I** Recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, 1991 (Narasimham Committee I):

- Deregulation of the interest rate structure.
- Progressive reduction in pre-emptive reserves.
- Liberalization of the branch expansion policy.
- Introduction of prudential norms to ensure capital adequacy, proper income recognition classification of assets based on their quality and provisioning against bad and doubtful debts.
- Decreasing the emphasis laid on directed credit and phasing out the concessional rate of interest to priority sector.
- Deregulation of the entry norms for private sector banks and foreign banks.
- Permitting public and private sector banks to access the capital market.
- Setting up of the Asset Reconstruction Fund.
- Constituting the special debt recovery tribunals.
- Freedom to appoint chief executive and officers of the banks.
- Changes in the constitutions of the board.
- Bringing NBFCs under the ambit of regulatory framework.

**Phase II** Recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, April 1998 (Narasimham Committee II).

# **Capital Adequacy**

Capital adequacy ratio to be raised from 8 per cent to 10 per cent by 2002.

- Hundred per cent of fixed income portfolio marked-to-market by 2001 (up from 70 per cent).
- Five per cent market risk weight for fixed income securities and open foreign exchange position limits (no market risk weights previously).
- Commercial risk weight (100 per cent) to government-guaranteed advances (previously treated as risk-free).

• The banking industry has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% during 2000–2009.

• There has been a deterioration in asset quality, low profitability and liquidity in the banking sector. The business growth of scheduled commercial banks(SCBs) remained subdued with public sector banks(PSBs) continuing to lag behind their private sector peers.

# **Asset Quality**

- Banks should aim to reduce gross non-performing assets to three per cent and net NPAs to zero per cent by 2002.
- Ninety-day overdue norm to be applied for cash-based income recognition (down from 180 days).
- Government-guaranteed irregular accounts to be classified as NPAs and provided for.
- Asset reconstruction company to take on NPAs of weak banks against issue of risk-free bonds.
- Directed credit obligations to be reduced from 40 per cent to 10 per cent.
- Mandatory general provisions of one per cent of standard assets and specific provisions to be made tax-deductible.

## **Systems and Methods**

- Banks to start recruitment of skilled, specialized manpower from the market.
- Overstaffing to be dealt with by redeployment and right-sizing via voluntary retirement schemes.
- Public sector banks to be given flexibility in remuneration structure.
- Rapid introduction of computerization and technology.

## **Industry Structure**

- Only two categories of financial sector players to emerge: banks and non-bank finance companies; DFIs to convert to banks or remain non-bank companies.
- Mergers to be driven by market and business considerations, not imposed by regulators.
- Weak banks to convert to 'narrow banks', restructure, or close down if proven unviable.
- Entry of new private sector banks and foreign banks to continue.
- Banks to be given greater functional autonomy, and minimum government shareholding to be reduced to 33 per cent from 55 per cent for the State Bank of India and 51 per cent for other public sector banks.

## **Regulation and Supervision**

- Banking regulation and supervision to be progressively delinked from monetary policy.
- Board for Financial Regulation and Supervision to be constituted with statutory powers; board members should be professionals.
- Greater emphasis on public disclosure as opposed to disclosure to regulators.

### **Legal Amendments**

- Broad range of legal reforms to facilitate recovery of problem loans.
- Introduction of laws governing electronic funds transfer.
- Amendments in the Banking Regulation Act, the Nationalization Act and the State Bank of India

Act to allow greater autonomy, higher private sector shareholding, and so on.

The RBI introduced a new mechanism for early detection of NPAs-a new system of reporting stressed assets when the interest and principal is not paid for 30 days and 60 days onwards which also alerts other banks to act early to protect their money.

The RBI formed a central repository of information for large borrowers of more than  $\overline{5}5$  crore. The banks are required to share all the default cases to this repository so that other banks will also benefit in terms of timely information. This would also bring down the number of wilful defaulters.

The recommendations of the PJ Nayak committee for improving the governance of banks have been accepted by the RBI which will be shortly implemented. This RBI-appointed committee has suggested bifurcating the post of chairman and managing director, setting fixed five-year tenure for both top executives and also professionalizing the board.

Introduction of more debt recovery tribunals and bankruptcy laws for speedy disposal of stressed cases for recovery of NPAs.

The Banking structure itself has been reformed by the RBI by issuing two new licenses to completely different entrants – HYPERLINK "http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/microfinance-sector-postsimpressive-growth-in-2014/1/213953.html"microfinance institution Bandhan Financial Services and infrastructure lender IDFC. The RBI has also issued differentiated licenses for small banks and payment banks, which will create new institutions for covering urban poor as well as people in rural and semiurban areas who are not covered by the banking system.

Systemic institutions which are 'too big to fail' have been identified by the RBI which will come under a special regulatory regime requiring higher capital.

The statutory liquidity ratio has been brought down to 20 per cent. The priority sector lending guidelines have been revised in April 2016 by including new sectors and a new scheme - priority sector lending certificates (PSLCs) – has been introduced.

# **Technology in Banking**

Private sector banks brought the state-of-the-art technology into the banking system. With increasing competition, public sector banks also adopted the new technology. The Central Vigilance Commission issued a directive on the need to computerize 70 per cent of the banking business by public sector banks before January 1, 2001. Basic computerization by public sector banks was started in 1993. The foreign banks and private sector banks have successfully transited from physical cash to anytime and anywhere money. 'Click banking' has replaced 'queue banking'.

Both the RBI and public sector banks have realized the importance of technology to survive and thrive. Technology has made the banking business truly international and efficient. Technology will act not only as the facilitator but a catalyst to reach out and meet expectations of demanding customers. More than 95 per cent of the branches have been fully computerized and 79.4 per cent of these branches have corebanking solutions (CBS), which is automation of banks across multiple-delivery channels. It helps banks achieve a centralized processing mechanism and, in turn, provide an any time any where services to their customers. The CBS enables the customers of banks to undertake their transactions from any branch of a bank instead of being attached to a particular branch, thereby resulting in better delivery of various customer services by the banks.

Banks have introduced innovative products such as e-banking and e-payments. Electronic banking (e-banking) is banking with the use of electronic tools and facilities and through electronic delivery channels. Most banks offer electronic banking through automatic teller machines, telephone transactions, and the Internet. Electronic banking enables banks to provide efficient services at lower costs and expand their geographical reach. Internet banking is the predominant mode of e-banking. It has made banking personalized and customized. It enables providing general purpose information to customers through banks' websites, electronic information transfer through passwords, and fully electronic transactional system, which allows bi-directional transactional capabilities and requires a high degree of security and control.

Banks have already rolled out mobile banking services. Internet and mobile banking have brought about a revolution in banking services.

The growth in banking technology and automation of banking processes has enabled extension of reach and low costs transactions. Automated teller machines (ATMs) have emerged as an alternative banking channel which facilitates low cost transactions vis-a-vis traditional branches. The increased use of ATMs by foreign banks and private sector banks has helped these banks to compete with public sector banks. Technology has enabled both foreign banks and private sector banks to expand their reach and provide improved customer service. The high cost of ATM cards and machines and poor telecommunication infrastructure inhibit the rapid growth of the ATMs.

Networking of branches and automating systems will help in increasing fee-based income. For instance, Corporation Bank migrated its cash management product—Collection and Payments Service (CAPS)—to the Internet, making it accessible to corporate customers on their desk tops. Cash management covers collections and disbursements of operating flows and specialized cash flow streams such as equity issue collections, dividends, interest and principal repayments, and excise and sales tax paid. Customers are now demanding value-added services and hence, banks have to speed up IT implementation.

Leading private, public and foreign bamks are offering a variety of instant any time-any where banking feature such as viewing of transation details, bill payment services, linking of bank accounts to other financial services such as demat and equity trading accounts and loan and credit accounts.

Technology can substantially bring down the menace of non-performing assets plaguing the banking system. Currently, software packages are available for improving the credit management about banks. These packages allow bankers to track details for each borrower such as principal and interest payable, business cycle of clients and end-use of funds.

## **Payment and Settlement System**

A payments system comprises of a set of rules, institutions, and technology for transfer of funds from one entity to another. It constitutes the core of a well-functioning financial system as the failure of a payment

- Cheque Truncation system(CTS) is a step towards improving the pace of clearance without involving end-to-end physical movement of cheques.
- Debit cards are a more popular mode of electronic money that credit cards.

• The total number of ATMs during 2012–13 increased to 1,14,014. Growth driven by private sector banks with a share of 38 per cent.

system may result in a systemic risk thereby triggering bank runs. It also plays an important role in the implementation of monetary policy as it provides the means through which monetary policy signals are transmitted. A well-functioning payment system is a prerequisite for proper conduct of monetary policy, efficient delivery of financial services, and minimizing transaction costs.

The Payment and Settlement System Act, 2007 came into effect on August 12, 2008. It has designated the Reserve Bank of India as the authority to regulate and supervise the payment systems in the country, including those operated by non-banks such as the CCIL, card companies, other payment system providers and all prospective organizations for payments. Under the Act, the RBI has the powers to authorise an entity to operate a payment system, lay down operational and technical standards for the various payment systems, call for information and returns/documents from the service providers and imposing fines on failure to do so or on providing false information. The RBI is also empowered to issue directions and guidelines to the system providers, prescribe the duties to be performed by them and audit and inspect their systems/premises

The RBI has initiated payment and settlement reforms, focusing on commercially important centres which account for 65 per cent of the banking business in terms of values. The RBI has emphasized developing an institutional framework to oversee payment system information technology applications and institution of satellite-based and terrestrial-based communications infrastructure.

There are two kinds of payment system in operation-retail and large value payment systems.

**(i) Retail payment system** It comprises of paper-based payment system, and electronic payment systems like the electronic clearing services (ECS), NEFT and card payment system.

As cheques play an important role in the retail payment system, clearing houses have been computerized to increase efficiency in the cheque clearing system. Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology for large clearing houses and Magnetic Media Based Clearing System (MMBCS) technology in smaller clearing houses whose low volumes make the use of MICR technology unviable have been introduced. The RBI implemented Cheque Truncation System (CTS) in February 2008 in the National Capital Region. In this system, the physical movement of cheques to all payee bank branches has been truncated or shorterned. The choice of the point of truncation, whether at the collecting branch or at its service branch, is left to the individual banks who are the members of the New Delhi Bankers' Clearing House to decide. Clearing takes place based on the validation of cheque images.

Electronic payment systems are becoming more popular. Electronic payments (e-payments) is effecting payments through electronic means such as electronic clearing service (ECS)—both debit and credit, national electronic funds transfer system (NEFT), and card based payment credit and debit). To encourage the use of electronic mode of payments, the Reserve Bank waived the processing charges for all electronic payment systems operated by it till March 2009. All large value payments of  $\bar{\tau}$ l crore and above, migrated to the electronic mode successfully and the threshold limit was brought down to  $\overline{z}10$  lakh with effect from August 1, 2008.

ECS (credit) is used for direct credit such as salary and pension payments, and refund of initial public offering (IPOs). and the ECS (debit) for direct debit such as collection of bills, insurance premia and equated monthly installment payments of loans. The NEFT, launched by the RBI in November 2005, enables transfer of funds within and across cities and between branches of a bank and across banks. While the transfer of funds is electronically, it is not actually instant-it takes a day for transfer of funds. Generally, banks do not charge customers who avail of this facility. Private sector banks and foreign banks are the most active users of this product.

With the rapid growth in the usage of mobile phones and their wider geographical coverage, banks have been exploring the use of mobile banking as an alternative channel of delivery of banking services. The service is presently available on GSM handsets only and users conduct their transactions using their m-PIN. According to the RBI, the long-term goal of the mobile payment framework in India would be to enable fund transfer from an account in one bank to any other account in any bank on a real time basis irrespective of the mobile network the customer has subscribed to.

The use of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) for cash withdrawal and balance enquiry is steadily increasing. The National Financial Switch (NFS) network, which started its operations on August 27, 2004 and is operated by Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, enables inter-operability of the ATM cards issued by any bank across the entire network. All cash withdrawals from all ATMs would be free with effect from April 1, 2009.

**(ii) Large Value Payment Systems** They consist of the real time gross settlement system (RTGS), government securities clearing and foreign exchange clearing. The RTGS was operationalized in March 2004. The RBI has mandated the use of electronic mode of payment between entities regulated by it. Banks, primary dealers, the RBI and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation are members of the RTGS system The RTGS provides for continuous (*i.e.*, in real time) processing and settlement of funds transfers. It settles inter-bank

transactions and time-critical transactions on behalf of customers and also facilitates settlement of all retail paper-based and electronic clearings taking place in Mumbai. Under RTGS, money is actually transferred instantly (with a marginal time lag) to the beneficiary account. The RTGS transaction can be undertaken during banking hours on working days. Both the bank and the beneficiary bank branch should be enabled for RTGS transaction. To avail of this facility, a customer is required to transfer at least  $\bar{\tau}1$  lakh. The reach and utilization of the RTGS for funds transfer is consistently increasing. The RTGS system has been integrated with the RBI's internal accounting system (IAS) has enabled straight through processing (STP). The integration of RTGS-IAS and the securities settlement system has made automatic intraday liquidity available.

The Clearing Corporation Of India Limited (CCIL) clears and settles inter-bank trades in Government securities, secondary market outright sales and repo transactions in government securities, OTC trades reported on the NDS platform, trades which are contracted on the online anonymous, trading platform NDS–OM, collateralized borrowing and lending obligations (CBLOs), and foreign exchange. These trades are settled on a D*v*P III basis, *i.e.,* the funds leg as well as the securities leg is settled on a net basis. The CCIL also provides guaranteed settlement facility for all dollar-rupee, inter-bank cash, Spot and Forward transactions by becoming the central counterparty to every trade accepted for settlement, through the process of novation. The rupee legs of the transactions are settled through the members' current accounts with the Reserve Bank and the dollar leg through the CCIL's account with the Settlement Bank at New York. The CCIL also provides continuous linked settlement services for banks in India by availing third party services of a settlement bank.

The RBI implemented the Centralized Funds Management System (CFMS), as an intermediate service facility, which provides backoffice support and funds transfer. The CFMS enables the funds and treasury managers of commercial banks to obtain the consolidated accountwise, centrewise position of their balances with all the 17 deposit accounts departments (DAD) of the RBI. It also enables transfer of funds from one RBI office to another.

In order to bring down transaction costs, the Indian Banks Association (IBA) has proposed to set up a new entity-National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which will be jointly owned by banks. It will be a section 25 company, which will not distribute its profits as dividend, but will plough it back for the improvement and expanding the reach of the retail payment systems. It will carry out all sorts of financial settlements apart from RTGS settlement which will continue to be under the purview of the RBI. The setting up of this organization would bring about uniformity and standardization in retail payments, expand its reach and bring innovative products to augment customer convenience.

# **Diversification in Bank Operations**

In the post-liberalization era, public sector banks have diversified to non-traditional activities such as mutual funds, merchant banking, venture capital funding, and other para-banking activities such as leasing, hire purchase, and factoring. Earlier banks could undertake these activities only through their subsidiaries. Now banks can undertake these activities either through subsidiaries or in-house or both. The need for earning profits, maximizing economies of scale, an enlarging customer base, and becoming a one-stop financial services shop led banks to diversify in these new areas.

Most of the banks undertake merchant banking activities through their subsidiaries. The first merchant banking subsidiary set up in 1987 by the State Bank of India was known as SBI capital market. Merchant bankers offer a range of services relating to issue management, loan syndication, project counselling, working capital financing, foreign currency loans, and portfolio management. Public sector subsidiaries dominate this area of financial services.

Banks have also set up subsidiaries for acting as primary dealers for government securities. SBI Gilts, PNB Gilts, Gilts Securities Trading Corporation are some of the active primary dealers in government securities market.

Subsidiaries, such as SBI Factors and Canbank Factors, are leaders in factoring industry. Banks, through their subsidiaries also provide services such as securitization of loans, stock broking, and financial guarantee for infrastructure projects. Banks have plunged into the area of venture capital trading wherein they have contributed towards equity of venture capital funds floated by the Technology Development and Investment Corporation of India (TDICI).

Banks are now into retail banking, which encompasses deposit-and asset-linked products as well as other financial services offered to individuals for personal consumption. Banks are offering retail products such as housing loans for purchases of durables, auto loans, credit loans, educational loans, and credit cards. Retail banking is the new buzzword for all banks. Retail loan growth has been strong in India, growing at 37 per cent CAGR over the last three years. The components of retail loans comprise of housing loans, consumer durables, credit card receivables, auto loans, and other personal loans. The housing loan component constitutes more than 54 per cent of the total retail loan portfolio of banks.

- 96 Banks

• Retail banking comprises of loans for housing, consumer durables, auto loans, credit card receivables, and other personal loans.

Banks have been permitted to enter into the insurance business through a Government of India notification, which was issued on August 3, 2000. The RBI issued detailed guidelines on August 9, 2000. The SBI has set up a life insurance subsidiary on risk participation basis with a 74 per cent equity. Many domestic and foreign banks have been given 'in-principle' approval to act as corporate agents of insurance companies for distribution of insurance products on fee basis and to contribute to equity of insurance joint ventures on risk participation basis.

The SBI and co-promoters such as the Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, ICICI, IDBI, and LIC have set up a clearing corporation known as Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) in April 2001. CCIL has been set up for clearing and settlement of government securities and foreign exchange transactions. The SBI (chief promoter) and other co-promoters have contributed 51 per cent of the equity of the corporation while the balance 49 per cent has been contributed by other banks, financial institutions, primary dealers, and mutual funds. CCIL also acts as an intermediary for the RBI in the fixed income and forex markets. Any two banks undertaking a forex transaction have to route the trade through CCIL which guarantees the transaction. Thus banks are saved the trouble of sending instructions to correspondent branches across the world to take their transactions further.

Banks are now into loan syndications and consortium financing. Syndication is an arrangement where a group of banks, which may not have any other business relationship with the borrower, participate for a single loan. Corporates are now interested in raising funds for long-term financing for capital investment through loan syndication. Loan syndication has helped corporates to bring down their financial costs but has increased competition amongst banks. In a loan syndication, a group of banks comprising 10 to 30 banks participate to provide funds wherein one of the banks is the lead manager. This lead bank is decided by the corporate, depending on confidence on the lead manager, underwriting skills. Lead banks charge fees ranging from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent. This loan arrangement may have a tenure of around 10 years and offer many options to corporates like draw-down after around two years, linking of loans to project milestones being achieved and no commitment charges to be paid to the banks. These options help corporates to save atleast 30 to 40 basis points while raising money through a loan syndication, against a bond issuance as the corporates have to prepare one set of documentation. A loan syndication also helps corporates get a better pricing. Banks can offload these loans to other players in the market. Foreign banks such as StanChart, HSBC, ABN Amro, and Deutsche Bank, private banks like UTI Bank, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank and public sector banks like IDBI and SBI are prominent players in this market. Consortium lending is similar to loan syndication. In a consortium arrangement, the corporate gives a presentation to the banks for raising funds which leads to a continuous interaction between the consortium and the company. In this arrangement, the member banks offer a range of services from loan and letter of credit, to working capital and guarantees to the company.

The RBI has allowed individuals to remit upto \$2,00,000 a year. Foreign and private, sector banks have already launched foreign deposits and international mutual fund products. They are offering high net worth individuals an array of products such as equity brokerage where investors can buy and sell equities from any major global exchange, premium deposit which pays principal and interest in one or two currencies at a prearranged exchange rate upon maturity, dollar-denominated Indian corporate bonds which are listed overseas and investment in US Treasury Bond.

# **Consolidation in Banking**

In India, both small and big, strong and weak, rural and urban, public and private banks coexist. The distribution of banks in terms of profitability is skewed. Some banks earn high returns but are operating inefficiently and some banks are competing fiercely for a small segment of the market. Private sector banks have already put in place the latest technology while some public sector banks are still struggling to maintain their capital adequacy and other requirements. Hence, there is a need to restructure the banking industry. Moreover, reforms have ushered in new changes and new competition which has forced banks to improve their competitiveness. Restructuring and consolidation is one of the major routes through which the Indian banking system could bring in competitiveness.

Globally, bank mergers have increased for improving the structure and efficiency of the banking industry. A well-planned merger can be a boon as it reduces the cost of operation, expands the business profile, enhances growth, increases the capital base, which, in turn, increases the risk ability of the bank. This phenomenon of bank mergers is a relatively recent one in India. Mergers have gained importance on account of globalization, increasing competition, technological changes, and redefinition of takeovers. The Narasimham Committee on Reforms in Banking Sector (1998) recommended formation of three to four large banks with an international presence, eight to ten banks with a national presence, local banks with a regional presence, and presence of rural banks. The committee suggested mergers among strong banks, both in the public and private sectors and even with financial institutions and nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs).

In the early 1990s, New Bank of India merged with Punjab National Bank. It was a merger of a weak bank with a strong bank. In 1998, 20th Century Finance merged with Centurion Bank. In 1999, there were two mergers—Bareilly Corporation Bank merged with Bank of Baroda and Sikkim Bank merged with the Union Bank of India. In February 2000, Times Bank merged with HDFC Bank and in March 2001, Bank of Madura merged with ICICI Bank.

ICICI Limited merged with ICICI Bank on March 31, 2000, and converted itself into a universal bank. The Benares State Bank Limited (BSBL) was merged with Bank of Baroda (BOB) on June 20, 2002, and all the branches of BSBL have started functioning as branches of BOB from July 19, 2002. The Global Trust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with effect from August 14, 2004 under the powers vested with the RBI under the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 through a scheme sanctioned by the Government of India.

Punjab National Bank took over New Bank of India in 1993 and acquired Nedungadi Bank in 2005. During 2005–06, the Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd was amalgamated with the Federal Bank Ltd as its networth had turned negative. There was a voluntary amalgamation between Bank of Punjab Ltd and the Centurion Bank Ltd. The Centurion Bank subsequently changed its name to Centurion Bank of Punjab Ltd and then it was merged with HDFC Bank on May 23, 2008. On September 2, 2006, the United Western Bank Ltd (UWB) was placed under moratorium by the Central Government and later amalgamated with Industrial Development Bank Ltd on October 3, 2006. The Sangli Bank and The Bank of Rajasthan were merged with ICICI Bank on April 19, 2007 and May 2010. In all, there have been 22 deals involving mergers and acquisitions in the post reforms era. Since nationalization, there have been a total of 41 mergers and amalgamations. Of these, there have been 3 cases of consolidation between public sector banks, 24 cases of M and As of private banks with public sector banks and 14 cases of M and As of private bank with private bank. Of the 41 M and As, 24 have took place after the onset of reforms.

Consolidation is required among old private sector banks and cooperative banks.

PSU are saddled with unwieldy branch network. Moreover, weaker banks are faced with paucity of resources to adopt technology. Mergers and consolidations should be encouraged to exploit synergies, cost cutting and acquiring new markets. Merger of two regional banks is desirable. Moreover, the banks should close unviable branches and reduce staff strength.

At present, Section 44 A of the Banking Regulation Act allows a private bank to acquire another private bank (like the merger of Bank of Madura with ICICI Bank). However, the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act does not clearly spell out mergers and acquisitions among the public sector banks without the intervention of the RBI. Like, for instance, Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act gives the RBI powers to apply to the government to place banks under a moratorium and prepare a scheme for amalgamation (like in case of Oriental Bank of Commerce acquiring GTB). The provisions of the Banking Regulation Act need to be changed as the present trend is moving from a regime of a large number of small banks to consolidation—a small number of large banks. The merger of the SBI and its associates was completed in April, 2017. The finance ministry is actively considering more consolidation in the banking sector where the need for 5–6 banks of global size is felt.

# **Equity Capital Raised by Public Sector Banks**

Public sector banks were allowed to raise capital from the capital market to strengthen their capital adequacy ratios and reduce the holdings of the government/RBI. The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/1980 and the State Bank of India Act, 1955 were amended to allow banks to raise capital not exceeding 49 per cent of their equity.

Banks normally issue shares by way of: i) Public Issues: Initial Public Offer and Further Public Offer ii) Private Placement: Preferential Issue and Qualified Institutional Placement iii) Rights Issue and iv) Bonus Issues.

The State Bank of India was the first public sector bank to tap the equity market in December 1993. In October 1996, it once again tapped the capital market through a GDR issue of  $\bar{\tau}1,270$  crore. With these two issues, the holding of the RBI came down to 59.7 per cent in State Bank of India. Over the years 1993 to 2008, 16 PSBs raised capital through 37 public issues to the tune of  $\overline{34,679}$  crore. The market responded favourably to public sector banks' ventures to raise capital. Since 1995–96, private sector banks have raised capital through 34 equity issues to the tune of  $\overline{2}3,330$  crore Some public and private sector banks have also raised funds by way of ADRs/GDRs issues in the international capital market. Banks also raised capital through discounted subordinated debt which is classified as Tier II.

Both the public and private sector banks raised  $\overline{30,151}$  crore through private placements. As public sector banks accessed the capital market to raise funds, the equity held by the Government got diluted and the share of the public holding increased. The government holding was more than 90 per cent in two public sector banks only, while in three public sector banks, the government holding was close to 51 per cent.

The number of banks listed and traded on the NSE are 31—12 PSBs and 19 private sector banks. The government has also injected funds for strengthening the capital base of nationalized banks in three phases. The first phase covering the period 1984–85 to 1992–93 when the government recapitalized public sector banks without any preset norms. The second phase was initiated during the period 1993–1995, the beginning of the financial sector reforms wherein the public sector banks were given a higher priority to improve their financial health. The government injected  $\bar{\tau}10,987$  crore in public sector banks during this phase. In the third phase beginning 1996, the government decided to recapitalize the banks on a case to case basis with a condition to return the amount recapitalized to the government. recapitalization continued up to 1998–99. The total amount injected by the Government for strengthening the capital base of nationalized banks amounted to  $\overline{522,092}$  crore.

The nationalized banks have been enabled to raise capital through 'bonus' and 'rights' issue and also to increase or decrease the authorized capital with approval from the Central Government and the Reserve Bank without being limited by the ceiling of  $\overline{\epsilon}3000$  crore. As per the broad estimates from the Reserve Bank, public sector banks would require a common equity of  $\bar{\tau}1.4-1.5$  trillion in addition to  $\bar{\mathcal{L}}2.65-2.75$  trillion as non-equity capital to meet the full Basel III norms by 2018. Banks, therefore, need to design appropriate strategies for meeting these capital norms.

In the Union Budget, the Centre had allocated a total of  $\overline{525,000}$  crore for the capitalisation of public sector banks in the financial year 2016–17, in line with the infusion plans announced under the umbrella scheme "Indradhanush" introduced in 2015. The plan proposes infusions adding up to  $\bar{\tau}$ 25,000 crore in 2015–16 as well as in 2016–17, followed by  $\text{\textless}10,000$  crore each in 2017–18 and 2018–19. The funds will help the banks in increasing their lending, raising additional funds and clean up balance sheets.

### **Risk Management in Banks**

Banks are unique financial intermediaries as they are highly leveraged(more than ten to one) which puts them in control of very large volume of public funds. They also administer the payment and settlement system which is the backbone of any economy. A loss of public confidence in a bank can lead to a run on the bank causing systemic failure, thereby, destabilizing the financial system.

Banking is the business of money where high risks are involved. Deregulation and globalization have introduced new types of risks. Risk may be defined as an exposure to a transaction with loss, which occurs with some probability and which can be expected, measured and minimized. An element of risk is inherent in the banking operations. Banks have to manage and balance risk. Banks are now involved in a variety of activities from basic lending to trading complex instruments, engaging in off-balance sheet transactions, and have ventured in new markets, which have increased the risk management challenges. Risk management system is important for Indian banks in the reforms era. Volatility has increased and margins have squeezed and hence, if banks do not have a cushion against losses, they may face a problem of survival. Thus, risk management is necessary to ensure sound, stable and efficient banking system. It is a continuous process which helps identify the amount and type of risks that the bank is willing to take, mobilize enough capital to cover such risks and allocate capital to profitable business units. Risk management involves identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks to optimize risk-reward trade-off.

## **Steps in Risk Management Process**

**Risk Analysis** It implies a backroom exercise of looking at the entire gamut of risks. Risk analysis is defining the risk, which, in turn requires understanding the nature of risks to which the bank is exposed to and then try to quantify their impact on the bank. Thus, risk analysis includes risk identification and risk measurement.

**Risk Identification** This is in effect an attempt at listing out the risks to which the bank is exposed. Identifying risks attached to the assets, liabilities and the process of the bank requires a clear understanding of the operations, organization structure, form of the organization, process flow, geographical concentration of risk, etc.

Since a bank operates in a specific economic environment, it is also necessary to understand the external factors like economy, regulatory environment, investor behavior and competition. A bank cannot manage its risks if it does not know what they are. A sound information system is a pre-requisite for risk management.

### **Steps in Risk Management Process**

- Risk Analysis
- Risk Identification
- Risk Measurement
- Risk Control
- Risk Monitoring

The banking system faces different types of risks such as credit risk, market risk, technological risk, liquidity risk, and contingent risk.

- *Credit risk:* This arises due to default in payment or delayed payment. In other words, it is the risk of not getting back the money that is lent. Credit risks include counterparty default risk-the possibility that the other party in an agreement will default and concentration risk—probability that any single exposure or group of exposures may have the potential to produce losses large enough to threaten a bank's health or ability to maintain its core operations.
- *Interest rate risk (IRR)*: This arises from adverse movements in interest rates which bring about changes in a bank's portfolio value both in trading book (*i.e.*, assets that are regularly traded and are liquid in nature) and in banking book (*i.e.*, assets that are usually held till maturity and rarely traded). Changes in market interest rates might adversely affect a bank's financial condition. The immediate impact of changes in interest rates is on bank's earnings through changes in its Net Interest Income (NII), known as 'earnings perspective'. A long-term impact of changes in interest rates is on bank's Market Value of Equity (MVE) or Net worth through changes in the economic value of its assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, known as 'economic value' perspective. Economic value of the bank is the present value of future cash flows. The economic value is arrived at by discounting the future cash flows by using an appropriate discount rate. Thus, economic value is affected both by changes in future cash flows and discount rate

The deregulation of interest rates and the flexibility given to banks in pricing most of the assets and liabilities have exposed the banking system to Interest Rate Risk.

IRR can arise on account of (i) differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows fluctuations in interest rate levels that have differing impacts on bank assets and liabilities known as the repricing risk, (ii) changes in portfolio values caused by unanticipated shifts in the slope and shape of yield curve known as the yield curve risk, (iii) imperfect correlation between interest rates across different interest rate markets for similar maturities known as the basis risk, and (iv) risks arising from interest rate options embedded in a bank asset, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions known as the options risk.

- *Market risk:* This risk arises due to fluctuations in market prices of equity due to general market-related factors. A bank generally invests funds in securities including equity market. The changes in the value of a bank's investment portfolio as a result of securities market behavior is called market risk.
- *Foreign exchange risk*: This risk arises from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Moreover, banks may suffer losses due to interest rate risk, which arises from the maturity mismatching of foreign currency. Banks undertake operations in foreign exchange like accepting deposits, making loans and advances, quoting prices for foreign exchange transactions and sometimes undertaking trading positions. The increased capital flows across the globe coupled with volatility has made the banks balance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate movements. Mismatched currency position also exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. Change in exchange rate has an impact on the bank's foreign exchange open positions and consequently its capital requirements. A depreciation in the rupee leads to a loss on oversold positions and a gain on the overbought positions.
- *Operational risk:* This risk emanates from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, system and procedures and controls or from external events. Operations comprise of the day-to-day activities of the bank in terms of processes and procedures in accordance with its strategy, channel and culture. Disruptions in operational flow due to failure of internal system results in financial losses. Operational risk events include internal and external frauds, workplace safety, system failures, etc. Operational risks also include: (i) Legal risk-bank's failure to enact appropriate policies, procedures, or controls to ensure it conforms to laws, regulations, contractual arrangements, and other legally binding agreements and requirements; (ii) Documentation risk-risk arising out of improper or insufficient documentation which gives rise to ambiguity regarding the characteristics of the financial contract; (iii) Technological risk: Technological changes—especially in the fields of computers and communication—give rise to technological risk. The banks should properly assess technological risk and adopt suitable strategies and measures to manage this risk.
- *Liquidity risk:* This risk arises from a bank's inability to meet its obligations when they become due, and refers to situations in which a a tradeable financial instrument or an asset may not be realized in cash Liquidity risk may be classified into: (i) Term Liquidity Risk which arises due to an unexpected delays in repayments of the capital in lending transactions; (ii) Withdrawal/Call Risk, a primary liquidity risk, which arises on account of excess withdrawal of deposits than expected thus creating constraints for bank to meet its payment obligations-deposit run-offs in a bank-specific event; (iii) Structural Liquidity Risk which arises when the necessary funding transactions cannot be carried

out (or can be carried only on less favorable terms); (iv) Contingent liquidity risk which is the risk associated with finding additional funds or replacing maturing liabilities under potential, future stressed market conditions; and (v) Market liquidity risk which arises when positions cannot be sold within a desired time period or can be sold only at a discount (market impact). This is especially the case with securities/derivatives in illiquid markets. Sharp and unanticipated market movements or defaults could cause demand for additional collateral calls from exchanges/settlement platforms in connection with foreign exchange and securities transactions, as liquidity risk emanates from maturity mismatch of assets and liabilities, the gap in mismatch may be narrowed by raising funds from the money market. Of all the financial risks, liquidity risk is more important and it has to be kept within acceptable limits, otherwise banks dependence on the money market would increase.

 Banks with large off-balance sheet exposures or major deposit chunk from corporates or higher growth in assets have relatively high level of liquidity risk. Recent liquidity crisis has revealed that liquidity problems have the potential to affect bank balance sheets and bank capital adequacy.

- *Strategic Risk*: This risk arises on account of poor implementation of business decisions a failure to adapt to changes in the economic environment which has an adverse effects on capital and earnings.
- *Contingent Risk:* This is also referred to as off-balance sheet risk as it is associated with off balance sheet activities of banks such as lines of credit, and forward contracts. Off-balance sheet products that can give rise to unexpected demands for liquidity at banks include committed lending facilities to customers, committed backstop facilities, and committed back-up lines to special purpose vehicles.

**Risk Measurement** After the identified risks are documented, they have to be quantified in terms of the financial impact they are likely to have on the bank, if they strike. Banks utilize traditional tools such as ratio analysis and cash flow projections to quantify liquidity. Banks have gradually started using quantitative techniques and models to manage risk.

Statistical models are used to measure and manage the financial risks to which banks are exposed. These models provide a framework for identifying, analysing, measuring, communicating and managing these risks. Some popular statistical models used by banks are: *Gap analysis model:* which calculates the repricing gap between the interest revenue earned on the bank's assets and the interest paid on its liabilities over a particular period of time. Interest rate risk in the Fixed Income portfolio of Bank's investments is managed through Duration analysis.; *Value at Risk:* which measures market risk inherent in trading portfolios. It is the maximum expected loss that a bank can suffer over a target horizon, given a certain confidence interval; Banks also carry out *Duration Gap* analysis to estimate the impact of change in interest rates on economic value of Bank's assets and liabilities and thus arrive at changes in Market Value of Equity (MVE). Duration Gap model recognizes the changes in the value of assets and liabilities by a given change in the market interest rate. The change in value of equity (including reserves) with 1 per cent parallel shift in interest rates for both assets and liabilities needs to be estimated. *Credit Risk Assessment (CRA) Mod*els to assess the counterparty Risk, by taking into account the various risks categorized broadly into financial, business, industrial and management Risks, each of which is scored separately. Banks have also set up exposure limits to achieve a well-diversified portfolio across dimensions such as companies, group companies, industries, collateral type, and geography. For avoidance of concentration of credit risks, internal guidelines on prudential exposure norms in respect of individual companies, group companies, banks, individual borrowers, non-corporate entities, sensitive sectors such as capital market, real estate, sensitive commodities, etc. have been put in place by banks.

**Risk Control** Banks have put processes and controls in place in regard to various aspects of Credit Risk Management such as appraisal, pricing, credit approval authority, documentation, reporting and monitoring, review and renewal of credit facilities, managing of problem loans, credit monitoring, etc. Banks have laid down trading and investment policies with defined market risk management parameters for each asset class and have got these policies approved by their boards.

To control and mitigate operational risks, banks have issued detailed procedural guidelines for processing various banking transactions and necessary instructions to all offices regarding delegation of financial powers, which detail sanctioning powers of various levels of officials for different types of financial transactions. Banks have started training programmes for their staff to create an awareness of the different types of risks. Banks have put in place a system of prompt submission of reports on frauds and a comprehensive system of preventive vigilance. Banks have also set up an Inspection & Management Audit Department to periodically conduct risk based audits and evaluate adequacy and effectiveness of the control systems and the functioning of various control procedures. It also conducts review of the systems established to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, codes of conduct and the implementation of policies and procedures. Some banks have obtained insurance cover for potential operational risks. Banks have started building a comprehensive database of losses due to Operational Risks to graduate to Advanced Measurement Approaches for Operational Risk Management.

**Risk Monitoring** Risk monitoring is evaluating the performance of bank's risk management strategies in achieving overall objectives. For effective monitoring, risk measures should be reported regularly and clearly compare current exposures to policy limits. Further past risk estimates should be compared with actual outcomes to identify any shortcomings in risk measurement techniques. Regular monitoring activities can help in quickly detecting and correcting deficiencies in the policies, processes and procedures for managing risk, which, in turn, reduce the potential frequency and/or severity of a loss. The risk management strategy also has to change in accordance with the changed risk climate. This will be possible only if a concrete monitoring system is in place right from the beginning.

## **Risk Management Tools**

Risk management in Indian banks was undertaken to comply with the RBI guidelines. The RBI issued detailed guidelines for risk management system in banks in October 1999, encompassing credit, market, and operational risks. The guidelines required banks to put in place loan policies approved by their board of directors, covering the methodologies for measurement, monitoring, and control of credit risk. The guidelines also required banks to evaluate their portfolios on an on-going basis, rather than at a time close to the balance sheet date and also to measure the current and potential credit exposures in case of off-balance sheet exposures, on a daily basis. Banks were also asked to fix a definite time frame for moving over to the value at risk (VaR) and duration-a measure of the per cent change in the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change in the level of interest rates-approaches for the measurement of interest rate risk. Now banks look at their risk management system as a means of optimising their risk-reward trade-off.

Banks use a variety of tools to manage their risks which include hedging the credit risks by resorting to restricting fresh exposures, outright sale of an existing fund based exposure, obtaining credit guarantee cover, and more recently securitization.

Banks have adopted asset-liability management and stress testing as tools of risk management.

### **Asset liability management (ALM)**

Asset liability management (ALM) is a tool of liquidity management. Asset liability management is a process of planning, organizing, and controlling asset and liability volume maturities, rates and yields so as to match the structure of liabilities with structure of assets. The objective of ALM is to avoid mismatch of assets and liabilities and to enable banks to measure and monitor risk, and provide suitable strategies for their management.

Information systems and organization structure play a key role in asset liability management. Banks need information regarding the behavior of asset and liability products in different branches. It is easier to collect reliable information in respect of foreign exchange, investment portfolio and money market operations as these functions are centralized.

The RBI advised banks in February 1999 to put in place an ALM system and set up internal asset liability management committees at the top management level to oversee its implementation To effectively manage asset-liability mismatches, the Board should have overall responsibility for management of risks and should decide the risk management policy of the bank and set limits for liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity price risks. An Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) should be set up consisting of the bank's senior management including CEO who should be responsible for ensuring adherence to the limits set by the Board as well as for deciding the business strategy of the bank (on the assets and liabilities sides) in line with the bank's budget and from risk-return perspective including the strategic management of interest rate and liquidity risks. Each bank will have to decide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility as also the decisions to be taken by it. The functions of ALCO are: (i) Product pricing for both deposits and advances and desired maturity profile of the incremental assets and liabilities; (ii) monitoring the risk levels of the bank; (iii) review the results of and progress in implementation of the decisions made in the previous meetings; (iv) articulate the current interest rate view of the bank and base its decisions for future business stragtegy on this view; (v) decide on source and mix of liabilities or sale of assets and a funding mix between fixed vs floating rate funds, wholesale vs retail deposits, money market vs capital market funding, domestic vs. foreign currency funding, etc.

The ALCO would be supported by an ALM desk consisting of operating staff which would be responsible for analyzing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to. The staff would also prepare forecasts (simulations) showing the effects of various possible changes in market conditions related to the balance sheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to bank's internal limits.

The ALCO would be headed by the top management, the CEO/CMD or ED The Chiefs of Investment, Credit, Funds Management/Treasury (forex and domestic), International banking and Economic

#### **Tools of Risk Management**

- Asset Liability Management
- Stress Testing

• Asset liability management is a process of planning, organizing and controlling asset and liability volume maturities, rates and yields so as to match the structure of liabilities with structure of assets.

Research can be members of the Committee. In addition. the Head of the Information Technology Division should also be an invitee for building up of MIS and related computerization.

Banks should also constitute a professional managerial and Supervisory Committee consisting of three to four directors which will oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.

# **ALM guidelines**

The guidelines mainly address Liquidity, Currency, and Interest Rate risks.

#### *Liquidity Risk Management*

Liquidity management is the core activity of bank as it not only helps bank to meet its liabilities when they become but also reduces the probability of an adverse situation developing. The importance of liquidity rises above individual institutions, as liquidity shortfall in one institution can have repercussions on the entire system. Bank management should measure not only the liquidity positions of banks on an ongoing basis but also examine how liquidity requirements are likely to evolve under crisis scenarios. Experience shows that assets commonly considered as liquid like Government securities and other money market instruments could also become illiquid when the market and players are unidirectional. Therefore liquidity has to be tracked through maturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net funding requirements, the use of a maturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of funds at selected maturity dates is adopted as a standard tool.

The Maturity Profile could be used for measuring the future cash flows of banks in different time buckets. The time buckets given the Statutory Reserve cycle of 14 days may be distributed as under:

- 1. Next day
- 2. 2–7 days
- 3. 8–14 days
- 4. 15–28 days
- 5. 29 days and upto 3 months
- 6. Over 3 months and upto 6 months
- 7. Over 6 months and upto 12 months
- 8. Over 1 year and upto 2 years
- 9. Over 2 years and upto 5 years
- 10. Over 5 years

Within each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and outflows. While the mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of impending liquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1–14 days and 15–28 days. Banks, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total) across all time buckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board/Management Committee. The mismatch during 1–14 days and 15–28 days should not in any case exced 20 per cent of the cash outflows in each time bucket. The net cumulative negative mismatches during the next day, 2–7 days, 8–14 days and 15–28 days buckets should not exceed 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets. If a bank in view of its asset—liability profile needs higher tolerance level, it could operate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board/Management Committee giving reasons on the need for such higher limit. A copy of the note approved by Board/ Management Committee may be forwarded to the Department of Banking Supervision, RBI. The discretion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a temporary period, till the system stabilizes and the bank is able to restructure its asset-liability pattern.

The Statement of Structural Liquidity may be prepared by a placing all cash inflows and outflows in the maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability will be a cash outflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. In case the net cumulative negative mismatches during the Day 1, 2–7 days, 8–14 days and 15–28 days buckets exceed the prudential limit of 5, 10, 15, and 20 per cent of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets the bank may show by way of a foot note as to how it proposes to finance the gap to bring the mismatch within the prescribed limits. The gap can be financed from market borrowings (call/term), Bills Rediscounting, Repos and deployment of foreign currency resources after conversion into rupees (unswapped foreign currency funds), etc.

## *Currency Risk*

Managing Currency risk is one more dimension of Asset—Liability Management. Mismatched currency position besides exposing the balance sheet to movements in exchange rate also exposes it to country risk and settlement risk. Ever since the RBI (Exchange Control Department) introduced the concept of end of the day near square position in 1978, banks have been setting up overnight limits and selectively undertaking active day time trading. Following the introduction of 'Guidelines for Internal Control over Foreign Exchange Business' in 1981, maturity mismatches (gaps) are also subject to control. Following the recommendations of Expert Group on Foreign Exchange Markets in India (Sodhani Committee) the calculation of exchange position has been redefined and banks have been given the discretion to set up overnight limits linked to maintenance of additional Tier I capital to the extent of 5 per cent of open position limit. Presently, the banks are also free to set gap limits with RBI's approval but are required to adopt Value at Risk (VaR) approach to measure the risk associated with forward exposures. Thus the open position limits together with the gap limits form the risk management approach to forex operations.

### *Interest Rate Risk (IRR)*

In the context of poor MIS, slow pace of computerization in banks and the absence of total deregulation, the traditional Gap analysis is considered as a suitable method to measure the Interest Rate Risk. It is the intention of RBI to move over to modern techniques of Interest Rate Risk measurement like Duration Gap Analysis, simulation and Value at Risk at a later date when banks acquire sufficient expertize and sophistication in MIS. The Gap or Mismatch risk can be measured by calculating Gaps over different time intervals as at a given date. Gap analysis measures mismatches between rate sensitive liabilities and rate sensitive assets (including off-balance sheet positons). Rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are those whose prices can be moved upwards or downwards with a change in the interest rates. Where all assets and liabilities are linked to floating interest rates or prime lending rates (PLR) of banks, any change in the interest rates would normally impact the interest rates pertaining to those assets and liabilities which are due for maturity/re-pricing.

- 1. Over one month and upto 3 months
- 2. Over 3 months and upto 6 months
- 3. Over 6 months and upto 12 months
- 4. Over 1 year and upto 3 years
- 5. Over 3 years and upto 5 years
- 6. Over 5 years
- 7. Non-sensitive

The Gap is the difference between Rate-sensitive Assets (RSA) and Rate-sensitive Liabilities (RSL) for each time bucket. The positive Gap indicates that it has more RSAs than RSLs whereas the negative Gap indicates that it has more RSLs. The Gap reports indicate whether the institution is in a position to benefit from rising interest rates by having a positive Gap (RSA > RSL) or whether it is in a position to benefit from declining interest rates by a negative Gap (RSL > RSA). The Gap can, therefore, be used as a measure of interest rate sensitivity.

Each bank should set prudential limits on individual Gaps with the approval of the Board/Management Committee. The prudential limits should have a bearing on the total assets, earning assets, or equity. The banks may work out earnings at risk, based on their views on interest rate movements and fix a prudent level with the approval of the Board/Management Committee.

# **Stress Testing**

Banks use statistical models to measure risks but these models fail to incorporate all possible risk outcomes. Moreover, some events are unlikely but plausible and may be sudden which are not captured by the models. Hence, there is a need for banks to have robust stress testing process. Stress tests would enable banks to assess the risk more accurately and, thereby, help estimate financial resources. They also supplement the internal capital models where lack of historical data limits the predictive power of the models. The RBI issued guidelines on stress testing in 2007. These guidelines cover all major risk areas, *viz*. market risks, credit risks, operational risks and liquidity funding risk.

There are broadly two categories of stress tests used in banks viz. sensitivity tests and scenario tests. These may be used either separately or in conjunction with each other.

*Sensitivity tests* are normally used to assess the impact of change in *one variable* (for example, a high magnitude parallel shift in the yield curve, a significant movement in the foreign exchange rates, a large movement in the equity index etc.) on the bank's financial position.

*Scenario tests* include simultaneous moves in a *number of variables* (for example, equity prices, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, liquidity etc.) based on a single event experienced in the past (*i.e.*, *historical scenario*—for example, natural disasters, stock market crash, depletion of a country's foreign exchange reserves) or a plausible market event that has not yet happened (*i.e.*, *hypothetical scenario*—for example, collapse of communication systems across the entire region/country, sudden or prolonged severe economic downturn) and the assessment of their impact on the bank's financial position.

### **Guidelines for Stress Testing**

#### *Framework Requirements*

Banks shall put in place a Board approved 'Stress Testing framework' to suit their individual requirements which would integrate into their risk management systems. The framework should satisfy the following essential requirements:

1. The Board approved 'stress testing policy' should detail (a) the frequency and procedure for identifying the principal risk factors which affect the bank's portfolio and should be stressed; (b) the methodology for constructing appropriate and plausible single factor and multi factor stress tests; (c) the procedure for setting the stress tolerance limits; (d) the process for monitoring the stress loss limits; (e) the remedial actions required to be taken at the relevant stages; (f) the authorities desig-

**Categories of Stress Tests**

• Sensitivity tests

• Scenario tests

nated to activate the remedial actions; (g) the need for identification of the responsibilities assigned to various levels/functional units; and (h) the need for specification of reporting lines.

- 2. The senior management should be actively involved in identifying the principal risk factors; designing appropriate single factor/multi factor stress tests; setting the stress tolerance limits; reviewing the stress test results and monitoring the stress loss limits; activating the appropriate remedial actions; periodically communicating the stress test results and the actions taken, if any, to the Board; reviewing the need to modify the stress testing framework with reference to certain elements like the risk factors, stress scenarios, levels of stress to be applied, the underlying assumptions, stress tolerance levels, remedial actions etc.; designing an appropriate MIS to support the stress tests to be conducted; and ensuring an appropriate and effective internal control mechanism to validate the stress tests and their findings;
- 3. Board and senior management should regularly review the results of scenario analyses and stress tests, including the major assumptions that underpin them. Stress test results may be used for setting risk limits; allocating capital for various risks; managing risk exposures; and putting in place appropriate contingency plans for meeting the situations that may arise under adverse circumstances.
- 4. Stress testing framework should be calibrated according to the complexity of each bank's business activities. The number of risk factors to be stressed would depend on the complexity of the portfolio and the risks the bank is exposed to. Banks should be able to justify their choice of stress tests and the choice of risk factors that are stressed. Banks which have foreign operations, or/and are active in derivatives markets, or/and are operating an active trading portfolio should use a combination of scenario analysis and sensitivity tests. Other banks may confine themselves to sensitivity tests run relatively more frequently to assess the impact of the relevant principal risk factors on their financial condition.
- 5. Banks are free to choose the various assumptions underlying the stress tests and the basis for their assumptions. However, these should be well documented and available for verification by the supervisor/auditors. The assumptions underlying the stress tests should be reviewed periodically for assessing their validity. Banks should undertake fresh stress tests when there are significant modifications in the underlying assumptions. Such periodic reviews are necessary to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness of the stress testing framework.
- 6. Banks should use appropriate, accurate and complete data when performing stress tests. The IT resources should be commensurate with the complexity of the techniques and the coverage of the stress tests. Banks should have adequate MIS in place to support the stress testing framework. The systems should be able to support the conduct of stress tests on different risks at relevant levels (portfolios, regions, business units) and also aggregate the results for the bank as a whole.
- 7. As the environment in which banks are operating is quite dynamic, there are changes in macroeconomic environment, banks' instruments, trading strategies and regulatory policies. The risk measurement methodologies and stress testing techniques in banks should, therefore, evolve to accommodate these changes. The stress testing framework should, therefore, be reviewed periodically to determine its efficacy and to consider the need for modifying any of the elements. The framework should be subjected to at least annual reviews which should cover, among others, the following aspects:
  - a. Adequacy of the documentation for various elements of the stress testing framework;
  - b. Integration of the stress testing framework in the day-to-day risk management processes;
  - c. Scope of coverage of the framework and the levels of stress applied;
  - d. Integrity of MIS and data feeding into the stress tests; and
  - e. Adequacy of the remedial actions and the efficiency of the systems for their activation;

### *Identification of Risks*

While traditionally stress tests are used in the context of managing *market risks*, these may also be employed in the management of *credit risks, operational risks, and liquidity funding risk*. Banks should identify their major risks that should be subjected to stress tests. While identifying the major risks, banks should understand their exposures and the risks to which these are exposed as well as the correlation between these risks. An indicative list of the risks that banks, in general, are exposed to are credit risk, credit concentration risk, interest rate risk, price risk, foreign currency risk, impact of market movements on contingent credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risks, prepayment risk, model risk, macro economic risk, and political risk. The above is only an indicative list and banks should identify the risks to which they are exposed to with regard to their bank specific circumstances and portfolio.
#### *Stress scenarios/Levels*

Banks should stress the relevant parameters at least at three levels of increasing adversity—minor, medium, and major—with reference to the normal situation and estimate the financial resources needed by it under each of the circumstances to:

- 1. meet the risk as it arises and for mitigating the impact of manifestation of that risk;
- 2. meet the liabilities as they fall due; and
- 3. meet the minimum CRAR requirements.

A scenario analysis measures the combined effect of adverse movements in more than one risk factor. Banks should determine the various risks that should be included in a scenario, take into account the linkages among the various risks without looking at each of them in isolation and assess the extent to which the stress would impact their financial position. Stress scenarios may be designed on the basis of either historical events or hypothetical events. An important element of scenario development will be the assessment and incorporation of the linkages between the various risk factors.

A few examples of stress factors/scenarios are as follows: domestic economic downturn, economic downturn of major economies to which the bank is directly exposed or to which the domestic economy is related; decline in the prospects of sectors to which the banks are having significant exposures; increase in level of NPAs and provisioning levels; increase in level of rating downgrades; failure of major counterparties; timing difference in interest rate changes (repricing risk); unfavourable differential changes in key interest rates (basis risk); parallel/non parallel yield curve shifts (yield curve risk); changes in the values of standalone and embedded options (option risk); adverse changes in exchange rates of major currencies; decline in market liquidity for financial instruments; stock market declines; tightening of market liquidity; significant operational risk events.

#### *Frequency of stress testing*

Banks may apply stress tests at varying frequencies dictated by their respective business requirements, relevance and cost. While some stress tests may be conducted daily or weekly—for example: trading book items for the various market risks; some others may be conducted at monthly or quarterly intervals—for example: those items which are less volatile in nature like credit risk in loans or HTM securities; interest rate risk in the banking book; and liquidity risk. Further, ad-hoc stress tests may be warranted when there are any special circumstances—for example: a rapidly deteriorating political/economic conditions in a country may warrant a quick assessment of the likely impact on the bank on account of its exposures to that country.

#### **Interpretation of Stress Test Results**

The results of the various stress tests should be reviewed by the senior management and reported to the Board. These results should be an essential ingredient of bank's risk management systems.

Banks should be conscious of the fact that the stress tests only indicate the likely impact and do not indicate the likelihood of the occurrence of the stress events. Since stress testing is influenced by the judgment and experience of the people who design the stress tests, the effectiveness of the stress tests will depend upon whether banks have identified their major risks, whether they have chosen the right level of stress/stress scenarios, whether they have understood and interpreted the stress test results properly and whether they have initiated the necessary steps to address the situation presented by the stress test results. Hence, each of the above aspects need to be assigned their due importance.

Banks should document the stress tests undertaken by them, the underlying assumptions, the results and the outcomes. The documentation should be preserved *at least* for five years.

### **Remedial Actions**

The remedial actions that banks may consider necessary to activate when the various stress tolerance levels are breached may include:

- 1. Reduction of risk limits;
- 2. Reduction of risks by enhancing collateral requirements, seeking higher level of risk mitigants, undertaking securitization, and hedging;
- 3. Amend pricing policies to reflect enhanced risks or previously unidentified risks;
- 4. Augmenting the capital levels to enhance the buffer to absorb shocks;

5. Enhancing sources of funds through credit lines, managing the liability structure, altering the liquid asset profile, etc.

### **Prudential Regulation**

There are two models for bank regulation: economic regulation and prudential regulation. Economic regulatory model calls for imposing constraints on interest rates, tightening entry norms, and directed lending. In the pre-reforms era, the RBI regulated banks through economic regulation. However, the empirical evidences indicated that this model hampered the productivity and efficiency of the banking system. Hence, the RBI adopted prudential regulation. Prudential regulatory model calls for imposing the regulatory capital level to maintain the health of banks and the soundness of the financial system. It allows greater play for market forces than economic regulatory model.

The RBI issued prudential norms based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee report. The major objective of prudential norms was to ensure financial safety, soundness, and solvency of banks. These norms strive to ensure that banks conduct their business activities as prudent entities, *i.e.*, not indulging in excessive risk taking and violating regulations in pursuit of profit. Banking reforms were initiated by implementing prudential norms consisting of capital adequacy ratio, asset classification, income recognition, and provisioning. The core of financial sector reforms has been the broadening of prudential norms to the best internationally recognized standards.

# **Regulatory Capital and Economic Capital**

The capital of a bank is a mix of regulatory capital and economic capital which are expected to cover unanticipated losses resulting from banks' business operations. The central bank prescribes the regulatory capital to be held mandatory by the bank as part of adherence to prudential regulations whereas, economic capital is held beyond the minimum required level at bank's own desire. Regulatory capital is held to comply with the regulator's requirements while economic capital is held to manage bank's own risks. The methodology to arrive at the amount of economic capital, the form in which it should be held and the areas of internal business it will support, may vary from bank to bank. Though both types of capital differ in scope and purpose, they are not mutually exclusive. Thus, the banks strive to maintain an optimal mix to minimize their average cost of capital.

## **The Basel Capital Accord**

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international organization which fosters international monetary and financial cooperation and serves as a bank for central banks.

The Basel Committee, established by the Central Bank Governors of the group countries at the end of 1974, meets regularly four times a year. It has about 30 technical working groups and task forces which also meet regularly.

India is a member of the group of 20 (G-20) countries that advises the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The Core Principles Liaison Group set up the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to promote and monitor principles of banking supervision and the working groups on capital, which discusses proposals for revising the capital adequacy framework. India is also an early subscriber to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and one of the first countries to accept the financial sector assessment programme of the IMF and the World Bank.

Different central banks in their own respective countries governed the banks by the rules set by them. International banks had to adhere to different regulations in different countries. To provide a level playing field for banks, the group of 15 most industrialized countries agreed on some common rules which came to be known as the Basel Accord. The central banks of more than 100 countries adopted it over a period of time.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) prepared a framework through a consultative process to secure international convergence of supervisory regulations governing the capital adequacy of international banks. This framework was finalized in 1988 and is known as the Basel Accord or Basel I. The objectives of Basel I were twofold: (i) serve to strengthen the soundness and stability of the international banking system, and (ii) to diminish an existing source of competitive inequality among international banks. The three main components of the Basel I framework were constituents of capital, the risk weighting system, and the target ratio. The central focus of this framework was credit risk and especially, country transfer risk. Basel I prescribed two tiers of capital for the banks: Tier I capital which can absorb losses without a bank being required to cease trading and Tier II capital which can absorb losses in the event of a winding-up.

- Tier I capital is capital fund which can absorb losses without a bank being required to cease trading and Tier II capital is capital fund which can absorb losses in the event of a winding-up.
- Tier I or Core Capital (the most permanent and readily available support against unexpected losses) included:
  - Paid-up capital, statutory reserves, share premium.
  - Capital reserve (representing surplus on sale of assets and held in a separate account only to be included) and other disclosed free reserves (if any) minus equity investments in subsidiaries, intangible assets, losses in the current period, and those brought forward from previous periods.
- Tier II Capital included:
  - Undisclosed reserves and fully paid-up cumulative perpetual preference shares.
  - Revaluation reserves arising out of revaluation of assets that are undervalued in the bank's books (like bank premises and marketable securities).
  - General provisions and loss reserves, not attributable to the actual diminution in value or identifiable potential loss in any specific asset and available to meet unexpected losses.
  - Hybrid debt capital instruments that combine characteristics of equity and debt.
  - Subordinated debt that is fully paid up, unsecured, subordinated to the claims of other creditors, free of restrictive clauses, and not redeemable at the initiative of the holder or without the consent of the supervisory authority of banks. If subordinated debt carries a fixed maturity, it should be subject to progressive discount and have an initial maturity of not less than five years.

At least 50 per cent of a bank's capital base was to consist of core elements and supplementary capital was allowed not to be more than 100 per cent of the core capital.

The Basel Accord (1988) suggested the following principles of capital adequacy:

- A risk weighted assets ratio method to be adopted by banks in which capital was related to different categories of asset or off-balance-sheet exposure, weighted according to broad categories of relative riskiness. There were only five weights recommended for on balance-sheet items, *i.e.,* 0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 per cent. Government bonds of the countries that were members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (which includes all members of the Basel Committee) were assigned a zero risk weight, all short-term inter-bank loans and all long term interbank loans to banks headquartered in OECD countries a 20 per cent risk weight, home mortgages a 50 per cent risk weight, and most other loans a 100 per cent risk weight.
- A bank must hold equity capital at least 8 per cent of its assets when multiplied by appropriate risk weights.
- When capital falls below this minimum requirement, shareholders may be permitted to retain control provided they agree to recapitalize the bank.
- When this is not done, the regulatory authority may, at its discretion, sell or liquidate the bank. Basel I could introduce discipline among banks through risk weighted capital adequacy norms. These norms (1988) helped to arrest the erosion of the banks' capital ratios. However, they were not found to be adequate due to their perceived rigidities. Moreover, the financial markets, financial intermediaries, business of banking, risk management practices, and supervisory approaches under went significant changes. The problems in South-east Asian economies, recessionary trends in the Japanese economy, the financial sector problems encountered in Latin American economies, and in some European economies emphasized that capital adequacy norms were not adequate to hedge against failures.

The Basel I capital adequacy norms were criticized as several deficiencies surfaced. These deficiencies were:

- 1. It recommended a 'one size-fits-all' approach that did not adequately differentiate between assets that have different risk levels. This standard encouraged capital arbitrage through securitization and off-balance sheet exposures.
- 2. It assumed that the aggregate risk of a bank was equal to the sum of its individual risks. It failed to take into consideration diversification of a bank's credit risk portfolio in the computation of capital ratios. Diversification through the pooling of risks could significantly reduce the overall portfolio risk of a bank.
- 3. These baseline capital adequacy norms were found to be inadequate as they almost entirely addressed credit risk Basel I did not explicitly address all the risks faced by banks such as liquidity risk, and operational risks.
- 4. Many large banks in advanced countries developed advanced risk measurement approaches to estimate the amount of capital required to support risks. Thus, the Basel I framework was found to be redundant in its approach.

In response to the same, the BCBS brought out their Consultative Paper on New Capital Adequacy Framework in June 1999 and a second revision in January 2001 after an informed public debate. The new rules have been effective from 2005.

The BCBS announced the establishment of an Accord Implementation Group.

The primary objectives of the new accord are (i) the promotion of safety and soundness of the financial system; (ii) the enhancement of competitive equality; (iii) the constitution of a more comprehensive approach to addressing risks.

The New Basel Capital Accord is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars that allow banks and supervisors to evaluate properly the various risks that the banks face. The New Basel Capital Accord focuses on the following points:

- Minimum capital requirements, which seek to refine the measurement framework set out in the 1988 accord.
- Supervisory review of an institution's capital adequacy and internal assessment process.
- Market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices.

**Pillar I: Capital Adequacy** The new framework maintains both the current definition of capital and the minimum requirement of 8 per cent of capital to risk-weighted assets. The revised accord will be extended on a consolidation basis to holding companies of banking groups. The accord stresses upon the improvement in the measurement of risks. Under Pillar 1, commercial banks are required to compute individual capital adequacy for three categories of risks: credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.

The new accord has elaborated the credit risk measurement methods and proposed a range of approaches to credit risk. The Basel II has recommended two approaches—the standardized approach, and the advanced internal risk based (AIRB) approach for estimating capital for credit risk. The standardized approach expands the scale of risk weights and uses external credit ratings to categorize credits. This approach can be employed by less complex banks. Banks with more advanced risks management capabilities can employ an IRB approach. This approach allows banks to use its internal estimates of the borrower's creditworthiness to assess credit risk in the portfolio subject to strict methodological and disclosure standards. The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD)—the probability that counterparty will default within one year, loss given default (LGD)—the amount of the loss expressed as a percentage of the amount outstanding at the time when the counterparty defaults, the exposure at default (EAD)—the credit amount outstanding at the time of default, and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.

One of the most noteworthy features of Basel II is assigning capital charge for operational risk. The BCBS has defined operational risk 'as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events'. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk.

Three approaches namely, basic indicator (BI), standardized (SA), and advanced measurement (AMA) approaches have been recommended for estimating capital for operational risk. Basic indicator approach, which is the simplest method of quantifying operational risks, is based on annual revenue of the bank. In this approach, a risk weight of 15 per cent is applied to a single indicator, specifically the average gross income (*i.e.,* the sum of net interest income and net non-interest income) over the previous three years. Standardized approach is based on annual revenue of each of the broad business lines of the bank and includes not only a risk weight of 15 per cent, but specific risk weights defined for each business line. In the Standardized Approach, banks' activities are divided into eight business lines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage Within each business line, gross income is a broad indicator that serves as a proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale of operational risk exposure within each of these business lines. The capital charge for each business line is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that business line. Beta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience for a given business line and the aggregate level of gross income for that business line. It should be noted that in the Standardized Approach gross income is measured for each business line, not the whole institution, *i.e.*, in corporate finance, the indicator is the gross income generated in the corporate finance business line.

The values of the betas are detailed below.

**Business Lines Beta Factors** Corporate finance 18 per cent, Trading and sales 18 per cent, Retail banking 12 per cent, Commercial banking 15 per cent, Payment and settlement 18 per cent, Agency services 15 per cent, Asset management 12 per cent, **and** Retail brokerage 12 per cent.

Advanced measurement approach is based on the internally developed risk measurement framework of the bank adhering to the standards prescribed and include methods such as internal measurement approach (IMA), loss distribution approach (LDA), scenario based, and scorecard. Advanced measurement approach calls for significant investment as compared to the other two approaches.

**Pillar II: Supervisory Review** This process emphasises the need for banks to develop sound internal processes to assess the adequacy of capital based on a thorough evaluation of its risks and set commensurate targets for capital. The internal processes would then be subjected to supervisory review and intervention. The supervisors would be responsible for evaluating the way the banks are measuring risks and the robustness of the systems and processes.

The four basic and complementary principles on which the Pillar 2 rests are: (a) a bank should have a process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile as well as a strategy for maintaining its capital levels; (b) supervisors should review and evaluate a bank's internal capital adequacy assessment and strategy as well as its compliance with regulatory capital ratios; (c) supervisors expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum; and (d) supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from dipping below prudential levels. Implementation of Pillar 2 requires that a comprehensive assessment of risks be carried out by both the banks (internally) and the supervisor (externally).

**Pillar III: Market Discipline** It can be bolstered through enhanced disclosure by banks. The new framework sets out disclosure requirements in several areas, including the way in which banks calculate their capital adequacy and their risk assessment methods. The transparency and disclosure standards will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes, and hence the capital adequacy of the bank.

Basel II is more risk sensitive and aligns banks' capital requirements more closely with the underlying risks in the balance sheet. It helps banks formulate not only a better risk management strategy but also business strategy and capital efficiency (lower regulatory capital) and allocation. Moreover, banks would be required to adopt superior technology and information systems for efficient data collection, and detailed technical analysis.

## **Implementation of Basel Norms in India**

The RBI adopted a phased approach to implementation of Basel norms in April 1992. Initially, the RBI directed the banks to maintain a minimum capital of 8 per cent on the risk-weighted assets. Banks with branches abroad were required to comply with minimum capital to risk weighted assets requirement of 8 per cent by end-March 1994, while other banks were required to comply by end-March 1996. The Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998) suggested further tightening of the capital adequacy norm. Subsequently the capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (CRAR) norm was revised upward to 9 per cent to be attained by March 2000. Moreover, with effect from the year ended-March 2006, banks in India are required to maintain capital charge for market risk also on their 'available for sale' portfolio, and 'held for trading' categories.

The RBI set up a Steering Committee comprising senior officials from 14 banks (public, private and foreign) and representatives of the Reserve Bank and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA). On the basis of the recommendations of the Steering Committee, The RBI issued detailed draft guidelines for implementation of the new accord in February 2005. The draft guidelines were revised and released on March 20, 2007 for comments/feedback and were then finalized on April 27, 2007 for implementation. The trial run on select banks on BaseI II norms was carried out in April 2006 and all banks adopted the norms by 2007.

The Reserve Bank gave more time to banks to put in place appropriate systems so as to ensure full compliance with Basel II. Foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having presence outside India migrated to the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk under Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008. All other scheduled commercial banks are to migrate to these approaches under Basel II in alignment with them but in any case not later than March 31, 2009.

The commercial banks, which account for about 78 per cent of the total assets of the banking sector, were required to maintain capital for both credit and market risks as per Basel II framework; while

• Banks in India are required to maintain a minimum CRAR of 9% on an on-going basis.

the cooperative banks were required to maintain capital for credit risk as per Basel I framework and the regional rural banks undergoing restructuring were not subject to Basel norms.

# **Pillar 1**

prescribes capital charge for three types of risks, *viz*., credit risk, market risk and operational risk.

The RBI has directed banks to adopt the standardized approach for **credit risk** wherein the rating assigned by the eligible external credit rating would largely support the measure of credit risk capital. Four domestic credit rating agencies (*viz*., Credit Analysis and Research Ltd., CRISIL Ltd., Fitch India, and ICRA Ltd.) and three international credit rating agencies (Fitch, Moody's, and Standard and Poor's) have been accredited by the Reserve Bank.

The on-balance sheet items are to be divided into fund-based and non-fund based and further classified as per the counterparty into certain asset heads such as domestic sovereigns, foreign sovereigns, public sector entities, and corporates for the purpose of assigning risk weights.

The off-balance sheet items are to be divided into market related and non-market related categories. The credit equivalent amount in the case of a non-market related off-balance sheet items like, direct credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items and commitments with certain drawdown, other commitments, etc. would be determined by multiplying the contracted amount of that particular transaction by the relevant credit conversion factor specified in the regulation. In the case of a market related off-balance sheet item like (a) interest rate contracts—including single currency interest rate swaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate futures; (b) foreign exchange contracts, including contracts involving gold,—includes cross currency swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps), forward foreign exchange contracts, currency futures, currency options; and (c) any other market related contracts specifically allowed by the Reserve Bank which give rise to credit risk., whether held in the banking book or trading book, the credit equivalent amount is to be determined by the current exposure method.

For on-balance sheet securitization exposures, banks are required to calculate the risk weighted amount exposure by multiplying the principal amount (after deduction of specific provisions) of exposures by the applicable risk weight as prescribed in the guidelines. For the rated off-balance sheet securitization exposures, banks are required to calculate the credit equivalent amount by multiplying the principal amount of the exposure (after deduction of specific provisions) with a 100 per cent credit conversion factor, unless otherwise specified. If the off-balance sheet exposure is not rated, it must be deducted from capital, except an unrated eligible liquidity facility.

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to capital charge requirement are:

- 1. The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; and
- 2. Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank (both banking and trading books).

Trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include:

- 1. Securities included under the Held for Trading category
- 2. Securities included under the Available for Sale category(iii) Open gold position limits
- 3. Open foreign exchange position limits
- 4. Trading positions in derivatives, and
- 5. Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.

The minimum capital requirement for **market risks** is expressed in terms of two separately calculated charges: (i) 'specific risk' charge for each security which is designed to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an individual security; and (ii) 'general market risk' charge towards interest rate risk in the portfolio, where long and short positions (which is not allowed in India except in derivatives) in different securities or instruments can be offset. The capital charge for equities would apply on their current market value in bank's trading book. The instruments covered include equity shares, whether voting or non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, for example: units of mutual funds, and commitments to buy or sell equity. Capital charge for specific risk as well as general market risk has been stipulated at nine per cent and is to be computed on the banks' gross equity positions. Banks have been directed to adopt standardized duration method to arrive at the capital charge.

Banks are required to compute their capital requirements for **operational risk** using the basic indicator approach where in, banks must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous • All SCBs in India have adopted the Standardized Approach (SA) for credit risk, Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for operational risk and standardized Duration Approach (SDA) for market risk for computing their capital requirements. three years of 15 per cent of positive annual gross income. If negative gross income distorts a bank's Pillar 1 capital charge for operational risk, the RBI could consider appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2.

# **Pillar 2**

The two important components of Pillar 2 are internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP). The ICAAP comprises a bank's procedures and measures designed to ensure (a) an appropriate identification and measurement of risks; (b) an appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the bank's risk profile; and (c) application and further development of suitable risk management systems in the bank. The ultimate responsibility for designing and implementation of the ICAAP lies with the bank's board of directors, and with the Chief Executive Officer in the case of foreign banks with branch presence in India. The ICAAP document has to be submitted every year by the banks to the RBI.

The SREP would be conducted periodically by the RBI and would consist of a review and evaluation of the bank's ICAAP, conducting an independent assessment of the bank's risk management processes and control systems and taking appropriate prudential and supervisory actions.

## **Pillar 3**

The RBI has set out disclosure standards for banks. Banks are required to ensure that there are no qualifications by the auditors in their financial statements for non-compliance with any of the accounting standards. Banks are now required to disclose maturity pattern of deposits, borrowings, investments, advances, foreign currency assets and liabilities, movements in NPAs, lending to sensitive sectors, total advances against shares, total investments made in equity shares, convertible debentures and equity oriented mutual funds, and movement of provisions held towards depreciation of investment. Banks are also required to comply with the Accounting Standard (AS I) on Disclosure of Accounting Policies issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). The scope of disclosures to be made in 'notes on accounts' has been enlarged. Banks with capital funds of  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore or more are required to make interim disclosures on the quantitative aspects, on a stand alone basis, on their respective websites at end-September each year. Qualitative disclosures that provide a general summary of a bank's risk management objectives and policies, reporting system and definitions are required to be published only on an annual basis. All banks with capital funds of  $\overline{500}$  crore or more, and their significant bank subsidiaries, must disclose their Tier 1 capital, total capital, total required capital and Tier 1 ratio and total capital adequacy ratio, on a quarterly basis on their respective websites.

## **Capital Adequacy Norms**

Bank's capital is vital as it is the lifeblood that keeps the bank alive; it also gives the bank the ability to absorb shocks and thereby, avoid the likelihood of bankruptcy.

Capital adequacy ratio is a measure of the amount of a bank's capital expressed as a percentage of its risk-weighted credit exposures.

The concept of capital adequacy ratio relates to risk weight assigned to an asset raised by the banks in the process of conducting business and to the proportion of capital to be maintained on such aggregate risk-weighted assets. Capital adequacy ratio is calculated on the basis of risk weightages on assets in the books of banks. Each business transaction carries a specific risk and a portion of capital has to be earmarked for this risk. This portion acts as a 'secret reserve' to cushion any possible future loss. Higher capital adequacy will drive banks towards greater efficiency and this could force banks to bring down operating costs. Capital adequacy enables banks to expand their balance sheet and strengthen their fundamentals, which, in turn, help the banks to mobilize capital at reasonable cost. Hence, quality and risk weightage of assets are the new important parameters which are crucial for the growth of banks. The RBI stipulates a capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent for all banks and a capital adequacy ratio below this stipulation indicates the inadequacy of a bank's capital, compared to its assets (largely loans advanced and investments) weighted against the risk they carry. In other words, the capital for these banks does not match up to the risk profile of their loan advances.

Although Basel II was a comprehensive capital regulation framework, it failed to address certain issues which emerged during the financial crisis of 2007–08 (Jayadev, M).

- Basel II was pro-cyclical; in times, when banks were doing well, it did not impose additional capital requirement on banks. On the other hand, in stressed times, when banks required additional capital,
- Capital adequacy ratio refers to the risk weight assigned to an asset raised by the banks in the process of conducting business and to the proportion of capital to be maintained on such aggregate risk weighted assets. The RBI stipulates a capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent for all banks.

Basel II required banks to bring capital. The failure to bring in additional capital forced major international banks into a vicious cycle of deleveraging, thereby leading global financial markets and economies around the world into recession.

- Most of the assets of the banks were trading book exposures such as securitized bonds, derivative products, and other toxic assets which could not be liquidated in the times of crisis.
- Banks were highly levered and there was no regulation for limiting leverage.
- Basel II failed to address liquidity risk as part of capital regulation. which cascaded into solvency risk.
- Basel II focused more on individual financial institutions and ignored the systemic risk arising from the interconnectedness across institutions and markets, which led the crisis to spread to several financial markets.

Hence, Basel III tries to address the above issues by (i) increasing the level and quality of capital- stricter definition of capital and introducing capital conservation buffer; (ii) introduction of liquidity standards- new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are to be introduced in 2015 and 2018, respectively; (iii) modifications in provisioning norms; and (iv) introduction of leverage ratio –3 per cent leverage ratio of Tier 1 will be tested before a mandatory leverage ratio is introduced in January 2018.

# **Basel III**

Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. These measures aim to:

- Improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source
- Improve risk management and governance
- Strengthen banks' transparency and disclosure
- The reforms target at:
- bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of individual banking institutions to periods of stress.
- macroprudential, system wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as the procyclical amplification of these risks over time.

These two approaches to supervision are complementary as greater resilience at the individual bank level reduces the risk of system wide shocks.

The Reserve Bank issued Guidelines based on the Basel III reforms on capital regulation on May 2, 2012 which have been implemented from April 1, 2013 in India in phases and it will be fully implemented as on March 31, 2018.

# **Composition of Regulatory Capital**

*General* Banks are required to maintain a minimum Pillar 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent on an on-going basis (other than capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer etc.). The Reserve Bank will take into account the relevant risk factors and the internal capital adequacy assessments of each bank to ensure that the capital held by a bank is commensurate with the bank's overall risk profile. This would include, among others, the effectiveness of the bank's risk management systems in identifying, assessing/measuring, monitoring and managing various risks including interest rate risk in the banking book, liquidity risk, concentration risk and residual risk. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank will consider prescribing a higher level of minimum capital ratio for each bank under the Pillar 2 framework on the basis of their respective risk profiles and their risk management systems. Further, in terms of the Pillar 2 requirements, banks are expected to operate at a level well above the minimum requirement. A bank should compute Basel III capital ratios in the following manners:

A bank shall comply with the capital adequacy ratio requirements at two levels:

The consolidated ('Group') level capital adequacy ratio requirements, which measure the capital adequacy of a bank based on its capital strength and risk profile after consolidating the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates etc. except those engaged in insurance and any non-financial activities; and

The standalone ('Solo') level capital adequacy ratio requirements, which measure the capital adequacy of a bank based on its standalone capital strength and risk profile.

Accordingly, overseas operations of a bank through its branches will be covered in both the above scenarios.

# Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio

# **Elements of Regulatory Capital and the Criteria for their Inclusion in the Definition of Regulatory Capital**

**Components of Capital** Total regulatory capital will consist of the sum of the following categories:

- (i) Tier 1 Capital (going-concern capital)
  - (a) Common Equity Tier 1
  - (b) Additional Tier 1
- (ii) Tier 2 Capital (gone-concern capital)

#### *Limits and Minima*

- (i) As a matter of prudence, it has been decided that scheduled commercial banks (excluding LABs and RRBs) operating in India shall maintain a minimum total capital (MTC) of 9 per cent of total risk weighted assets (RWAs), *i.e.*, capital to risk weighted assets (CRAR). This will be further divided into different components as described below.
- (ii) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital must be at least 5.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets (RWAs), *i.e.*, for credit risk + market risk + operational risk on an ongoing basis.
- (iii) Tier 1 capital must be at least 7 per cent of RWAs on an ongoing basis. Thus, within the minimum Tier 1 capital, Additional Tier 1 capital can be admitted maximum at 1.5 per cent of RWAs.
- (iv) Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 9 per cent of RWAs on an ongoing basis. Thus, within the minimum CRAR of 9 per cent, Tier 2 capital can be admitted maximum up to 2 per cent.
- (v) If a bank has complied with the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios, then the excess Additional Tier 1 capital can be admitted for compliance with the minimum CRAR of 9 per cent of RWAs.
- (vi) In addition to the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 5.5 per cent of RWAs, banks are also required to maintain a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 2.5 per cent of RWAs in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

For the purpose of all prudential exposure limits linked to capital funds, the 'capital funds' will exclude the applicable capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer as and when activated, but include Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital which are supported by proportionate amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital as indicated in paragraph 4.2.2(vii). Accordingly, capital funds will be defined as [(Common Equity Tier 1 capital) + (Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital eligible for computing and reporting CRAR of the bank)]. It may be noted that the term 'Common Equity Tier 1 capital' does not include capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer.

# **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital**

## **Common Equity**–**Indian Banks**

*Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital* Elements of Common Equity component of Tier 1 capital will comprise the following:

- (i) Common shares (paid-up equity capital) issued by the bank which meet the criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory purposes ;
- (ii) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of common shares;
- (iii) Statutory reserves;
- (iv) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets;
- (v) Other disclosed free reserves, if any;
- (vi) Balance in Profit & Loss Account at the end of the previous financial year;
- (vii) Banks may reckon the profits in current financial year for CRAR calculation on a quarterly basis provided the incremental provisions made for non-performing assets at the end of any of the four quarters of the previous financial year have not deviated more than 25 per cent from the average of the four quarters. The amount which can be reckoned would be arrived at by using the following formula:

 $EP_t = \{NP_t - 0.25*D*t\}$ 

Where;

 $EP_t =$  Eligible profit up to the quarter 't' of the current financial year; t varies from 1 to 4  $NP = Net profit up to the quarter 't'$ 

 $D$  = average annual dividend paid during last three years

- (viii) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties (*i.e.*, minority interest) which meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 capital (refer to paragraph 4.3.2); and
- (ix) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital [*i.e*., to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (viii)]

# **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital—Foreign Banks' Branches**

*Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital* Elements of Common Equity Tier 1 capital will remain the same and consist of the following:

- (i) Interest-free funds from Head Office kept in a separate account in Indian books specifically for the purpose of meeting the capital adequacy norms;
- (ii) Statutory reserves kept in Indian books;
- (iii) Remittable surplus retained in Indian books which is not repatriable so long as the bank functions in India;
- (iv) Interest-free funds remitted from abroad for the purpose of acquisition of property and held in a separate account in Indian books provided they are non-repatriable and have the ability to absorb losses regardless of their source;
- (v) Capital reserve representing surplus arising out of sale of assets in India held in a separate account and which is not eligible for repatriation so long as the bank functions in India; and
- (vi) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital [*i.e*., to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (v).

# **Additional Tier 1 Capital**

# **Additional Tier 1 Capital**−**Indian Banks**

*Elements of Additional Tier 1 Capital* Additional Tier 1 capital will consist of the sum of the following elements:

 (i) Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS), which comply with the regulatory requirements;

- (ii) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional Tier 1 capital;
- (iii) Debt capital instruments eligible for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital;
- (iv) Any other type of instrument generally notified by the Reserve Bank from time to time.
- (v) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, Additional Tier 1 instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties which meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital ; and
- (vi) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Additional Tier 1 capital [*i.e*., to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (v)].

## **Elements and Criteria for Additional Tier 1 Capital***–***Foreign Banks' Branches**

Various elements and their criteria for inclusion in the Additional Tier 1 capital are as follows:

- (i) Head Office borrowings in foreign currency by foreign banks operating in India for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital which comply with the regulatory requirements .
- (ii) Any other item specifically allowed by the Reserve Bank from time to time for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital; and
- (iii) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Additional Tier 1 capital [*i.e.*, to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (ii)].

## **Elements of Tier 2 Capital**

Under Basel III, there will be a single set of criteria governing all Tier 2 debt capital instruments.

### **Tier 2 Capital***–***Indian Banks**

- A. Elements of Tier 2 Capital
  - (i) *General Provisions and Loss Reserves* 
    - a. Provisions or loan-loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified losses, which are freely available to meet losses which subsequently materialize, will qualify for inclusion within Tier 2 capital. Accordingly, General Provisions on Standard Assets, Floating Provisions, Provisions held for Country Exposures, Investment Reserve Account, excess provisions which arise on account of sale of NPAs and 'countercyclical provisioning buffer12' will qualify for inclusion in Tier 2 capital. However, these items together will be admitted as Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25 per cent of the total credit risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Under Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach, where the total expected loss amount is less than total eligible provisions, banks may recognize the difference as Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 0.6 per cent of credit-risk weighted assets calculated under the IRB approach.
    - b. Provisions ascribed to identified deterioration of particular assets or loan liabilities, whether individual or grouped should be excluded. Accordingly, for instance, specific provisions on NPAs, both at individual account or at portfolio level, provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of assets in the case of restructured advances, provisions against depreciation in the value of investments will be excluded.
  - (ii) Debt Capital Instruments issued by the banks;
  - (iii) Preference Share Capital Instruments [Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS)/ Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS)/Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS)] issued by the banks;
  - (iv) Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Tier 2 capital;
  - (v)While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, Tier 2 capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties which meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital;
  - (vi) Revaluation reserves arising out of change in the carrying amount of a bank's property consequent upon its revaluation may, at the discretion of banks, be reckoned as Common Equity Tier (CET) 1 capital at a discount of 55%, instead of as Tier 2 capital under extant regulations, subject to meeting the following conditions:

- bank is able to sell the property readily at its own will and there is no legal impediment in selling the property;
- the revaluation reserves are shown under Schedule 2: Reserves & Surplus in the Balance Sheet of the bank;
- revaluations are realistic, in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards.
- valuations are obtained, from two independent valuers, at least once in every 3 years; where the value of the property has been substantially impaired by any event, these are to be immediately revalued and appropriately factored into capital adequacy computations
- the external auditors of the bank have not expressed a qualified opinion on the revaluation of the property;
- the instructions on valuation of properties and other specific requirements as mentioned in 'Valuation of Properties - Empanelment of Valuers' are strictly adhered to.
- (vii) Any other type of instrument generally notified by the Reserve Bank from time to time for inclusion in Tier 2 capital; and
- (viii) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Tier 2 capital [*i.e.*, to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (vii)].

# **Tier 2 Capital***–***Foreign Banks' Branches**

Elements of Tier 2 capital in case of foreign banks' branches will be as under:

- (i) General Provisions and Loss Reserves (as detailed in paragraph 4.2.5.1.A.(i) above);
- (ii) Head Office (HO) borrowings in foreign currency received as part of Tier 2 debt capital;
- (iii) Revaluation reserves at a discount of 55 per cent; and
- (iv) Less: Regulatory adjustments/deductions applied in the calculation of Tier 2 capital [*i.e.*, to be deducted from the sum of items (i) and (iii)].

## **Regulatory Adjustments/Deductions**

The following paragraphs deal with the regulatory adjustments/deductions which will be applied to regulatory capital **both** at solo and consolidated level.

- 1. **Goodwill and all Other Intangible Assets**
  - (i) Goodwill and all other intangible assets should be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. In terms of AS  $23$  – Accounting for investments in associates, goodwill/capital reserve arising on the acquisition of an associate by an investor should be included in the carrying amount of investment in the associate but should be disclosed separately. Therefore, if the acquisition of equity interest in any associate involves payment which can be attributable to goodwill, this should be deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 of the bank.
  - (ii) The full amount of the intangible assets is to be deducted net of any associated deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or derecognized under the relevant accounting standards. For this purpose, the definition of intangible assets would be in accordance with the Indian accounting standards. Operating losses in the current period and those brought forward from previous periods should also be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital.
  - (iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of any goodwill and other intangible assets from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the Balance Sheets of subsidiaries, in addition to deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets which pertain to the solo bank.

#### 2. **Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs)**

- (i) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such assets should be deducted in full from Common Equity Tier (CET)1 capital.
- (ii) DTAs which relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated losses) may, instead of full deduction from CET1 capital, be recognized in the CET1 capital up to 10% of a bank's CET1 capital, at the discretion of banks [after the application of all regulatory adjustments)

- (iii) Further, the limited recognition of DTAs as at (ii) above along with limited recognition of significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial (i.e. banking, financial and insurance) entities. (iii) taken together must not exceed 15% of the CET1 capital, calculated after all regulatory adjustments .However, banks shall ensure that the CET1 capital arrived at after application of 15% limit should in no case result in recognising any item more than the 10% limit applicable individually.
- (iv) The amount of DTAs which are to be deducted from CET1 capital may be netted with associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) provided that:
  - both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by the relevant taxation authority;
  - the DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets; and
  - the DTLs must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to deduction from CET1 capital as at (i) and (ii) above.
- (v) The amount of DTAs which is not deducted from CET1 capital (in terms of para (ii) above) will be risk weighted at 250% as in the case of significant investments in common shares not deducted from bank's CET1 capital .

#### 3. **Cash Flow Hedge Reserve**

- (i) The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve which relates to the hedging of items that are not fair valued on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be derecognized in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts should be deducted and negative amounts should be added back. This treatment specifically identifies the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that is to be derecognized for prudential purposes. It removes the element that gives rise to artificial volatility in Common Equity, as in this case the reserve only reflects one half of the picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not the changes in fair value of the hedged future cash flow).
- (ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of cash flow hedge reserve from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the subsidiaries, in addition to derecognition of cash flow hedge reserve pertaining to the solo bank.

#### 4. **Shortfall of the Stock of Provisions to Expected Losses**

The deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses under the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach should be made in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and should not be reduced by any tax effects that could be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses.

#### 5. **Gain-on-Sale Related to Securitization Transactions**

- (i) As per Basel III rule text, banks are required to derecognize in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, any increase in equity capital resulting from a securitization transaction, such as that associated with expected future margin income (FMI) resulting in a gain-on-sale. However, as per existing guidelines on securitization of standard assets issued by RBI, banks are not permitted to recognize the gain-on-sale in the P&L account including cash profits. Therefore, there is no need for any deduction on account of gain-on-sale on securitization. Banks are allowed to amortize the profit including cash profit over the period of the securities issued by the SPV. However, if a bank is following an accounting practice which in substance results in recognition of realized or unrealized gains at the inception of the securitization transactions, the treatment stipulated as per Basel III rule text as indicated in the beginning of the paragraph would be applicable.
- (ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of gain-on-sale from the consolidated Common Equity which is recognized by the subsidiaries in their P&L and/or equity, in addition to deduction of any gain-on-sale recognized by the bank at the solo level.

#### 6. **Cumulative Gains and Losses due to Changes in Own Credit Risk on Fair Valued Financial Liabilities**

 (i) Banks are required to derecognize in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, all unrealized gains and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities that are due to changes in the bank's own credit risk. In addition, with regard to derivative liabilities, derecognize all accounting valuation adjustments arising from the bank's own credit risk. The offsetting between valuation adjustments arising from the bank's own credit risk and those arising from its counterparties' credit risk is not allowed. If a bank values its derivatives and securities financing transactions (SFTs) liabilities taking into account its own creditworthiness in the form of debit valuation adjustments (DVAs), then the bank is required to deduct all DVAs from its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, irrespective of whether the DVAs arises due to changes in its own credit risk or other market factors. Thus, such deduction also includes the deduction of initial DVA at inception of a new trade. In other words, though a bank will have to recognize a loss reflecting the credit risk of the counterparty (*i.e.*, credit valuation adjustments-CVA), the bank will not be allowed to recognize the corresponding gain due to its own credit risk.

(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of unrealized gains and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities that are due to changes in the subsidiaries' credit risk, in the calculation of consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 capital, in addition to derecognition of any such unrealized gains and losses attributed to the bank at the solo level.

#### 7. **Defined Benefit Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities**

- (i) Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be fully recognized in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (*i.e.*, Common Equity Tier 1 capital cannot be increased through derecognizing these liabilities). For each defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognized under the relevant accounting standards.
- (ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of defined benefit pension fund assets and recognition of defined benefit pension fund liabilities pertaining to subsidiaries in the consolidated Common Equity Tier 1, in addition to those pertaining to the solo bank.
- (iii) From April 1, 2013, banks should deduct the entire amount of unamortized expenditure from common equity Tier 1 capital for the purpose of capital adequacy ratios.

#### 8. **Investments in Own Shares (Treasury Stock)**

- (i) Investment in a bank's own shares is tantamount to repayment of capital and therefore, it is necessary to knock-off such investment from the bank's capital with a view to improving the bank's quality of capital. This deduction would remove the double counting of equity capital which arises from direct holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares.
- (ii) Banks should not repay their equity capital without specific approval of Reserve Bank of India. Repayment of equity capital can take place by way of share buy-back, investments in own shares (treasury stock) or payment of dividends out of reserves, none of which are permissible. However, banks may end up having indirect investments in their own stock if they invest in/take exposure to mutual funds or index funds/securities which have long position in bank's share. In such cases, banks should look through holdings of index securities to deduct exposures to own shares from their Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Following the same approach outlined above, banks must deduct investments in their own Additional Tier 1 capital in the calculation of their Additional Tier 1 capital and investments in their own Tier 2 capital in the calculation of their Tier 2 capital. In this regard, the following rules may be observed:
  - (a) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital funds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the investing bank is known; the indirect investment would be equal to bank's investments in such entities multiplied by the per cent of investments of these entities in the investing bank's respective capital instruments.
  - (b) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital funds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the investing bank is not known but, as per the investment policies/mandate of these entities such investments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to bank's invest-

ments in these entities multiplied by 10 per cent18 of investments of such entities in the investing bank's capital instruments. Banks must note that this method does not follow corresponding deduction approach *i.e.*, all deductions will be made from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1/Tier 2 capital of the investing banks.

- (iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of subsidiaries' investments in their own shares (direct or indirect) in addition to bank's direct or indirect investments in its own shares while computing consolidated Common Equity Tier 1.
- 9. **Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities** 
  - 9.1 **Limits on a Bank's Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities**
    - (i) A bank's investment in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities is subject to the following limits:
      - (a) A bank's investments in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities should not exceed 10 per cent of its capital funds, but after all deductions mentioned in (8)above
      - (b) Banks should not acquire any fresh stake in a bank's equity shares, if by such acquisition, the investing bank's holding exceeds 5 per cent of the investee bank's equity capital.
      - (c) Under the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a banking company cannot hold shares in any company whether as pledge or mortgagee or absolute owner of an amount exceeding 30 per cent of the paid-up share capital of that company or 30 per cent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less.
      - (d) Equity investment by a bank in a subsidiary company, financial services company, financial institution, stock and other exchanges should not exceed 10 per cent of the bank's paid-up share capital and reserves.
      - (e) Equity investment by a bank in companies engaged in non-financial services activities would be subject to a limit of 10 per cent of the investee company's paid up share capital or 10 per cent of the bank's paid up share capital and reserves, whichever is less.
      - (f) Equity investments in any non-financial services company held by (a) a bank; (b) entities which are bank's subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures or entities directly or indirectly controlled by the bank; and (c) mutual funds managed by AMCs controlled by the bank should in the aggregate not exceed 20 per cent of the investee company's paid up share capital.
      - (g) A bank's equity investments in subsidiaries and other entities that are engaged in financial services activities together with equity investments in entities engaged in non-financial services activities should not exceed 20 per cent of the bank's paidup share capital and reserves. The cap of 20 per cent would not apply for investments classified under 'Held for Trading' category and which are not held beyond 90 days.
    - (ii) An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions other than banks and insurance companies for capital adequacy purposes is as under:
      - Asset Management Companies of Mutual Funds/Venture Capital Funds/Private Equity Funds etc;
      - Non-Banking Finance Companies;
      - Housing Finance Companies;
      - Primary Dealers;
      - Merchant Banking Companies; and
      - Entities engaged in activities which are ancillary to the business of banking under the B.R. Act, 1949.
    - (iii) Investments made by a banking subsidiary/ associate in the equity or non- equity regulatory capital instruments issued by its parent bank should be deducted from such subsidiary's regulatory capital following corresponding deduction approach, in its capital adequacy assessment on a solo basis. The regulatory treatment of investment by the nonbanking financial subsidiaries/associates in the parent bank's regulatory capital would, however, be governed by the applicable regulatory capital norms of the respective regulators of such subsidiaries/associates.

### 9.2 **Treatment of a Bank's Investments in the Capital Instruments Issued by Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities within Limits**

The investment of banks in the regulatory capital instruments of other financial entities contributes to the inter-connectedness amongst the financial institutions. In addition, these investments also amount to double counting of capital in the financial system. Therefore, these investments have been subjected to stringent treatment in terms of deduction from respective tiers of regulatory capital. A schematic representation of treatment of banks' investments in capital instruments of financial entities is shown below. Accordingly, all investments in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities within the limits mentioned in Paragraph 9.1 will be subject to the following rules.

| In the entities where the bank does not own more than 10% of<br>the common share capital of individual entity.                             | In the entities where<br>the bank owns more<br>than $10\%$ of the com-<br>mon share capital of<br>individual entity. |                                                                          |                                                                                                                                      |

### (A) **Reciprocal Cross-holdings in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities**

Reciprocal cross holdings of capital might result in artificially inflating the capital position of banks. Such holdings of capital will be fully deducted. Banks must apply a 'corresponding deduction approach' to such investments in the capital of other banks, other financial institutions and insurance entities. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of capital (Common Equity, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. For this purpose, a holding will be treated as reciprocal cross holding if the investee entity has also invested in the any class of bank's capital instruments which need not necessarily be the same as the bank's holdings.

- (B) **Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are outside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation and where the Bank does not Own more than 10 per cent of the Issued Common Share Capital of the Entity**
  - (i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10 per cent of the issued common share capital of the entity. In addition:
    - (a) Investments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine their underlying holdings of capital.
    - (b) Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital includes common stock (paid-up equity capital) and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments (e.g. subordinated debt).
    - (c) Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.
    - (d) If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory adjustment.

- (e) With the prior approval of RBI a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments where these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial assistance to reorganize a distressed institution.
- (ii) If the total of all holdings listed in paragraph (i) above, in aggregate exceed 10 per cent of the bank's Common Equity (after applying all other regulatory adjustments in full listed prior to this one), then the amount above 10 per cent is required to be deducted, applying a corresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. Accordingly, the amount to be deducted from common equity should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10 per cent of the bank's common equity (as per above) multiplied by the common equity holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings. This would result in a Common Equity deduction which corresponds to the proportion of total capital holdings held in Common Equity. Similarly, the amount to be deducted from Additional Tier 1 capital should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10 per cent of the bank's Common Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Additional Tier 1 capital holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings. The amount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10 per cent of the bank's Common Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2 capital holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings.
- (iii) If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a bank is required to make a deduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (*e.g.*, if a bank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).
- (iv) Investments below the threshold of 10 per cent of bank's Common Equity, which are not deducted, will be risk weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as per the market risk rules and instruments in the banking book should be treated as per the standardized approach or internal ratings-based approach (as applicable). For the application of risk weighting the amount of the holdings which are required to be risk weighted would be allocated on a pro rata basis between the Banking and Trading Book. However, in certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non-scheduled commercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing bank.
- (v) For the purpose of risk weighting of investments in as indicated in para (iv) above, investments in securities having comparatively higher risk weights will be considered for risk weighting to the extent required to be risk weighted, both in banking and trading books. In other words, investments with comparatively poor ratings (*i.e.*, higher risk weights) should be considered for the purpose of application of risk weighting first and the residual investments should be considered for deduction.

#### (C) **Significant Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are outside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation**

- (i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation where the bank owns more than 10 per cent of the issued common share capital of the issuing entity or where the entity is an affiliate of the bank. In addition:
  - Investments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine their underlying holdings of capital.
  - Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital includes common stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments (e.g., subordinated debt).
  - Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.
  - If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory adjustment26.
  - With the prior approval of RBI a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments where these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial assistance to reorganize a distressed institution.
# (ii) **Investments other than Common Shares**

All investments included in para (i) above which are not common shares must be fully deducted following a corresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same tier of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. If the bank is required to make a deduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (e.g., if a bank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).

#### (iii) **Investments which are Common Shares**

All investments included in para (i) above which are common shares and which exceed 10 per cent of the bank's Common Equity (after the application of all regulatory adjustments) will be deducted while calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The amount that is not deducted (upto 10 per cent if bank's common equity invested in the equity capital of such entities) in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 will be risk weighted at 250 per cent .However, in certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non-scheduled commercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing bank.

- 9.3 With regard to computation of indirect holdings through mutual funds or index funds, of capital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation, the following rules may be observed:
  - (i) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital funds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the financial entities is known; the indirect investment of the bank in such entities would be equal to bank's investments in these entities multiplied by the per cent of investments of such entities in the financial entities' capital instruments.
  - (ii) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital funds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the investing bank is not known but, as per the investment policies/mandate of these entities such investments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to bank's investments in these entities multiplied by maximum permissible limit which these entities are authorized to invest in the financial entities' capital instruments.
  - (iii) If neither the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital funds/private equity funds in the capital instruments of financial entities nor the maximum amount which these entities can invest in financial entities are known but, as per the investment policies/mandate of these entities such investments are permissible; the entire investment of the bank in these entities would be treated as indirect investment in financial entities. Banks must note that this method does not follow corresponding deduction approach *i.e.*, all deductions will be made from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1/Tier 2 capital of the investing banks.

*Transitional Arrangements* In order to ensure smooth migration to Basel III without aggravating any near term stress, appropriate transitional arrangements have been made. The transitional arrangements for capital ratios begin as on April 1, 2013. Capital ratios and deductions from Common Equity will be fully phased-in and implemented as on March 31, 2019. The phase-in arrangements for banks operating in India are indicated in Table 13.1.

# **Capital Charge for Credit Risk**

- 2.2 The Direct loan/credit/overdraft exposure, if any, of banks to the State Governments and the investment in State Government securities will attract zero risk weight. State Government guaranteed claims will attract 20 per cent risk weight.
- 2.3 The risk weight applicable to claims on central government exposures will also apply to the claims on the Reserve Bank of India, DICGC, Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) and Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing (CRGFTLIH). The claims on ECGC will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent.
- 2.4 The above risk weights for both direct claims and guarantee claims will be applicable as long as they are classified as 'standard'/performing assets. Where these sovereign exposures are classified as non-performing, they would attract risk weights as applicable to NPAs.
- 2.5 The amount outstanding in the account styled as 'Amount receivable from Government of India under Agricultural Debt Waiver Scheme, 2008' shall be treated as a claim on the Government of India and would attract zero risk weight for the purpose of capital adequacy norms. However, the amount outstanding in the accounts covered by the Debt Relief Scheme shall be treated as a claim on the borrower and risk weighted as per the extant norms.

### **3 Claims on Foreign Sovereigns**

3.1 Claims on foreign sovereigns will attract risk weights as per the rating assigned to those sovereigns/sovereign claims by international rating agencies as follows:

| <b>TABLE 13.2</b>      | Claims on Foreign Sovereigns – Risk Weights |    |            |                 |     |         |

*\* Standard & Poor's*

3.2 Claims denominated in domestic currency of the foreign sovereign met out of the resources in the same currency raised in the jurisdiction 33 of that sovereign will, however, attract a risk weight of zero per cent.

3.3 However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment to such claims in the books of the foreign branches of the Indian banks, they should adopt the requirements prescribed by the Host Country supervisors for computing capital adequacy.

# **4 Claims on Public Sector Entities (PSEs)**

- 4.1 Claims on domestic public sector entities will be risk weighted in a manner similar to claims on Corporates.
- 4.2 Claims on foreign PSEs will be risk weighted as per the rating assigned by the international rating agencies as under:

| TABLE 13.3         | Claims on Foreign PSEs - Risk Weights |           |              |                    |          |         |  |

# **5 Claims on MDBs, BIS and IMF**

Claims on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the following eligible Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) evaluated by the BCBS will be treated similar to claims on scheduled banks meeting the minimum capital adequacy requirements and assigned a uniform twenty per cent risk weight:

- (a) World Bank Group: IBRD and IFC,
- (b) Asian Development Bank,
- (c) African Development Bank,
- (d) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
- (e) Inter-American Development Bank,
- (f) European Investment Bank,
- (g) European Investment Fund,
- (h) Nordic Investment Bank,
- (i) Caribbean Development Bank,
- (j) Islamic Development Bank, and
- (k) Council of Europe Development Bank.

Similarly, claims on the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) will also attract a twenty per cent risk weight.

# **6 Claims on Banks (Exposure to capital instruments)**

- 6.1 In case of a bank's investment in capital instruments of other banks, the following such **investments** would not be deducted, but would attract appropriate risk weights:
  - (i) Investments in **capital instruments** of banks where the investing bank holds not more than 10 per cent of the issued common shares of the investee banks, subject to the following conditions:
    - Aggregate of these investments, together with investments in the capital instruments in insurance and other financial entities, do not exceed 10 per cent of Common Equity of the investing bank; and
    - The equity investment in the investee entities is outside the scope of regulatory consolidation.
  - (ii) **Equity investments** in other banks where the investing bank holds more than 10 per cent of the issued common shares of the investee banks, subject to the following conditions:
    - Aggregate of these investments, together with such investments in insurance and other financial entities, do not exceed 10 per cent of Common Equity of the investing bank.
    - The equity investment in the investee entities is outside the scope of regulatory consolidation.

Accordingly, the claims on banks incorporated in India and the branches of foreign banks in India, other than those deducted above, will be risk weighted as under:

| <b>TABLE 13.4</b>                                                                                                                                                  | Claims on Banks Incorporated in India and Foreign Bank Branches in India |                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                          |                |                                                                                                                    |                                                |                                                            |

*\** The deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

# **Notes:**

(i) In the case of banks where no capital adequacy norms have been prescribed by the RBI, the lending/investing bank may calculate the CRAR of the cooperative bank concerned, notionally, by obtaining necessary information from the investee bank, using the capital adequacy norms as applicable to the commercial banks. In case, it is not found feasible to compute CRAR on such notional basis, the risk weight of 350 or 625 per cent, as per the risk perception of the investing bank, should be applied uniformly to the investing bank's entire exposure.

6.2 The claims on foreign banks will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings assigned by international rating agencies.

The exposures of the Indian branches of foreign banks, guaranteed/counter-guaranteed by the overseas Head offices or the bank's branch in another country would amount to a claim on the parent foreign bank and would also attract the risk weights as per Table 13.5 above.

- 6.3 However, the claims on a bank which are denominated in 'domestic 36' foreign currency met out of the resources in the same currency raised in that jurisdiction will be risk weighted at 20 per cent provided the bank complies with the minimum CRAR prescribed by the concerned bank regulator (s).
- 6.4 However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment for such claims in the books of the foreign branches of the Indian banks, they should adopt the requirements prescribed by the Host supervisor for computing capital adequacy.

### 7. **Claims on Primary Dealers**

Claims on Primary Dealers shall be risk weighted in a manner similar to claims on corporates.

### 8. **Claims on Corporates, AFCs and NBFC-IFCs**

8.1 Claims on corporates, exposures on Asset Finance Companies (AFCs) and Non-Banking Finance Companies-Infrastructure Finance Companies (NBFC-IFC)38, shall be risk weighted as per the ratings assigned by the rating agencies registered with the SEBI and accredited by the Reserve Bank of India.

### **Notes:**

- (i) Risk weight on claims on AFCs would continue to be governed by credit rating of the AFCs, except that claims that attract a risk weight of 150 per cent under NCAF shall be reduced to a level of 100 per cent.
- (ii) No claim on an unrated corporate may be given a risk weight preferential to that assigned to its sovereign of incorporation.
- 8.2 The Reserve Bank may increase the standard risk weight for unrated claims where a higher risk weight is warranted by the overall default experience. As part of the supervisory review process, the Reserve Bank would also consider whether the credit quality of unrated corporate claims held by individual banks should warrant a standard risk weight higher than 100 per cent.
- 8.3 With a view to reflecting a higher element of inherent risk which may be latent in entities whose obligations have been subjected to re-structuring/re-scheduling either by banks on their own or along with other bankers/creditors, the unrated standard/performing claims on these entities should be assigned a higher risk weight until satisfactory performance under

the revised payment schedule has been established for one year from the date when the first payment of interest/principal falls due under the revised schedule. The applicable risk weights will be 125 per cent.

8.4 The claims on non-resident corporates will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings assigned by international rating agencies.

### 9. **Claims included in the Regulatory Retail Portfolios**

- 9.1 Claims (including both fund-based and non-fund based) that meet all the four criteria listed below in paragraph 5.9.3 may be considered as retail claims for regulatory capital purposes and included in a regulatory retail portfolio. Claims included in this portfolio shall be assigned a risk-weight of 75 per cent, except as provided in paragraph 5.12 below for nonperforming assets.
- 9.2 The following claims, both fund based and non-fund based, shall be excluded from the regulatory retail portfolio:
  - (a) Exposures by way of investments in securities (such as bonds and equities), whether listed or not;
  - (b) Mortgage Loans to the extent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured by residential property or claims secured by commercial real estate;

#### 10. **Claims secured by Residential Property**

10.1 Lending to individuals meant for acquiring residential property which are fully secured by mortgages on the residential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that is rented, shall be risk weighted as indicated as per Table 13.7(A) below, based on Board approved valuation policy. LTV ratio should be computed as a percentage with total outstanding in the account (viz. 'principal + accrued interest + other charges pertaining to the loan' without any netting) in the numerator and the realisable value of the residential property mortgaged to the bank in the denominator.

10.2 All other claims secured by residential property would attract the higher of the risk weight applicable to the counterparty or to the purpose for which the bank has extended finance.

10.3 Restructured housing loans should be risk weighted with an additional risk weight of 25 per cent to the risk weights prescribed above.

- 10.4 Loans/exposures to intermediaries for on-lending will not be eligible for inclusion under claims secured by residential property but will be treated as claims on corporates or claims included in the regulatory retail portfolio as the case may be.
- 10.5 Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) backed by exposures as at paragraph
- 10.6 Above will be governed by the guidelines pertaining to securitization exposures.

# 11. **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)**

- 11.1 The unsecured portion of NPA (other than a qualifying residential mortgage loan, net of specific provisions (including partial write-offs), will be risk-weighted as follows:
  - (i) 150 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are less than 20 per cent of the outstanding amount of the NPA;
  - (ii) 100 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are at least 20 per cent of the outstanding amount of the NPA;
  - (iii) 50 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are at least 50 per cent of the outstanding amount of the NPA
- 11.2 For the purpose of computing the level of specific provisions in NPAs for deciding the riskweighting, all funded NPA exposures of a single counterparty (without netting the value of the eligible collateral) should be reckoned in the denominator.
- 11.3 For the purpose of defining the secured portion of the NPA, eligible collateral will be the same as recognized for credit risk mitigation purposes. Hence, other forms of collateral like land, buildings, plant, machinery, current assets, etc. will not be reckoned while computing the secured portion of NPAs for capital adequacy purposes.
- 11.4 In addition to the above, where a NPA is fully secured by the following forms of collateral that are not recognized for credit risk mitigation purposes, either independently or along with other eligible collateral a 100 per cent risk weight may apply, net of specific provisions, when provisions reach 15 per cent of the outstanding amount:
  - (i) Land and building which are valued by an expert valuer and where the valuation is not more than three years old, and
  - (ii) Plant and machinery in good working condition at a value not higher than the depreciated value as reflected in the audited balance sheet of the borrower, which is not older than eighteen months.
- 11.5 The above collaterals (mentioned in paragraph 11.4) will be recognized only where the bank is having clear title to realize the sale proceeds thereof and can appropriate the same towards the amounts due to the bank. The bank's title to the collateral should be well documented. These forms of collaterals are not recognized anywhere else under the standardized approach.
- 11.6 Claims secured by residential property, as defined in paragraph 5.10.1, which are NPA will be risk weighted at 100 per cent net of specific provisions. If the specific provisions in such loans are at least 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the outstanding amount, the risk weight applicable to the loan net of specific provisions will be 75 per cent. If the specific provisions are 50 per cent or more the applicable risk weight will be 50 per cent.

# 12. **Specified Categories**

- 12.1 Fund based and non-fund based claims on Venture Capital Funds, which are considered as high risk exposures, will attract a higher risk weight of 150 per cent.
- 12.2 Reserve Bank may, in due course, decide to apply a 150 per cent or higher risk weight reflecting the higher risks associated with any other claim that may be identified as a high risk exposure.
- 12.3 Consumer credit, including personal loans and credit card receivables but excluding educational loans, will attract a higher risk weight of 125 per cent or higher, if warranted by the external rating (or, the lack of it) of the counterparty. As gold and gold jewellery are eligible financial collateral, the counterparty exposure in respect of personal loans secured by gold and gold jewellery will be worked out under the comprehensive approach .The 'exposure value after risk mitigation' shall attract the risk weight of 125 per cent.
- 12.4 Advances classified as 'Capital market exposures' will attract a 125 per cent risk weight or risk weight warranted by external rating (or lack of it) of the counterparty, whichever is higher. These risk weights will also be applicable to all banking book exposures, which are exempted from capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments/total capital market exposures.

- 12.5 The exposure to capital instruments issued by NBFCs which are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 125 per cent or as per the external ratings, whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instruments issued by NBFCs which are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted at 250 per cent. The claims (other than in the form of capital instruments of investee companies) on rated as well as unrated 'Nondeposit Taking Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-ND-SI), other than AFCs, NBFC-IFCs and NBFC-IDF, regardless of the amount of claim, shall be uniformly risk weighted at 100 per cent (for risk weighting claims on AFCs, NBFC-IFC and NBFC-IDF.
- 12.6 All investments in the paid-up equity of non-financial entities (other than subsidiaries) which exceed 10 per cent of the issued common share capital of the issuing entity or where the entity is an unconsolidated affiliate as defined in paragraph 4.4.9.2(C)(i) will receive a risk weight of 1111 per cent. Equity investments equal to or below 10 per cent paid-up equity of such investee companies shall be assigned a 125 per cent risk weight or the risk weight as warranted by rating or lack of it, whichever higher.
- 12.7 The exposure to capital instruments issued by financial entities (other than banks and NBFCs) which are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 125 per cent or as per the external ratings whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instruments issued by financial entities (other than banks and NBFCs) which are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 250 per cent.
- 12.8 Bank's investments in the non-equity capital eligible instruments of other banks should be risk weighted.
- 13. **Other Assets** 
  - 13.1 Loans and advances to bank's own staff which are fully covered by superannuation benefits and/or mortgage of flat/ house will attract a 20 per cent risk weight. Since flat/house is not an eligible collateral and since banks normally recover the dues by adjusting the superannuation benefits only at the time of cessation from service, the concessional risk weight shall be applied without any adjustment of the outstanding amount. In case a bank is holding eligible collateral in respect of amounts due from a staff member, the outstanding amount in respect of that staff member may be adjusted to the extent permissible.
  - 13.2 Other loans and advances to bank's own staff will be eligible for inclusion under regulatory retail portfolio and will therefore attract a 75 per cent risk weight.
  - 13.3 The deposits kept by banks with the CCPs will attract risk weights appropriate to the nature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities.
  - 13.4 All other assets will attract a uniform risk weight of 100 per cent.

# 14. **Off-Balance Sheet Items**

- 14.1 General
  - (i) The total risk weighted off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated as the sum of the risk-weighted amount of the market related and non-market related off-balance sheet items. The risk-weighted amount of an off-balance sheet item that gives rise to credit exposure is generally calculated by means of a two-step process:
    - (a) The notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit equivalent amount, by multiplying the amount by the specified credit conversion factor or by applying the current exposure method; and
    - (b) The resulting credit equivalent amount is multiplied by the risk weight applicable to the counterparty or to the purpose for which the bank has extended finance or the type of asset, whichever is higher.
  - (ii) Where the off-balance sheet item is secured by eligible collateral or guarantee, the credit risk mitigation guidelines may be applied.
- 14.2 Non-market-related Off Balance Sheet Items
  - (i) The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non-market related off-balance sheet item like, direct credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items and commitments with certain drawdown, other commitments, etc. will be determined by multiplying the contracted amount of that particular transaction by the relevant credit conversion factor (CCF).

- (ii) Where the non-market related off-balance sheet item is an undrawn or partially undrawn fund-based facility 46, the amount of undrawn commitment to be included in calculating the off-balance sheet non-market related credit exposures is the maximum unused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms a part of bank's on-balance sheet credit exposure.
- (iii) In the case of irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet facilities, the original maturity will be measured from the commencement of the commitment until the time the associated facility expires. For example an irrevocable commitment with an original maturity of 12 months, to issue a 6 month documentary letter of credit, is deemed to have an original maturity of 18 months. Irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet facilities should be assigned the lower of the two applicable credit conversion factors. For example, an irrevocable commitment with an original maturity of 15 months (50 per cent - CCF) to issue a six month documentary letter of credit (20 per cent - CCF) would attract the lower of the CCF *i.e.*, the CCF to the documentary letter of credit viz. 20 per cent.
- (iv) The credit conversion factors for non-market related off-balance sheet transactions are as under:

| <b>TABLE 13.8</b> | Credit Conversion Factors - Non-market related Off-Balance Sheet Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                               |

- (v) In regard to non-market related off-balance sheet items, the following transactions with non-bank counterparties will be treated as claims on banks:
  - Guarantees issued by banks against the counter guarantees of other banks.
  - Rediscounting of documentary bills discounted by other banks and bills discounted by banks which have been accepted by another bank will be treated as a funded claim on a bank.

In all the above cases banks should be fully satisfied that the risk exposure is in fact on the other bank. If they are satisfied that the exposure is on the other bank they may assign these exposures the risk weight applicable to banks.

- (vi) Issue of Irrevocable Payment Commitment by banks to various Stock Exchanges on behalf of Mutual Funds and FIIs is a financial guarantee with a Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) of 100. However, capital will have to be maintained only on exposure which is reckoned as CME, *i.e.*, 50 per cent of the amount, because the rest of the exposure is deemed to have been covered by cash/securities which are admissible risk mitigants as per capital adequacy framework. Thus, capital is to be maintained on the amount taken for CME and the risk weight would be 125 per cent thereon.
- (vii) For classification of banks guarantees *viz*. direct credit substitutes and transaction-related contingent items etc. the following principles should be kept in view for the application of CCFs:
  - (a) Financial guarantees are direct credit substitutes wherein a bank irrevocably undertakes to guarantee the repayment of a contractual financial obligation. Financial guarantees essentially carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit *i.e.*, the risk of loss is directly linked to the creditworthiness of the counterparty against whom a potential claim is acquired. An indicative list of financial guarantees, attracting a CCF of 100 per cent is as under:
    - Guarantees for credit facilities;
    - Guarantees in lieu of repayment of financial securities;
    - Guarantees in lieu of margin requirements of exchanges;
    - Guarantees for mobilization advance, advance money before the commencement of a project and for money to be received in various stages of project implementation;
    - Guarantees towards revenue dues, taxes, duties, levies etc. in favour of Tax/ Customs/Port/Excise Authorities and for disputed liabilities for litigation pending at courts;
    - Credit Enhancements;
    - Liquidity facilities for securitization transactions;
    - Acceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance);
    - Deferred payment guarantees.
  - (b) Performance guarantees are essentially transaction-related contingencies that involve an irrevocable undertaking to pay a third party in the event the counterparty fails to fulfil or perform a contractual non-financial obligation. In such transactions, the risk of loss depends on the event which need not necessarily be related to the creditworthiness of the counterparty involved. An indicative list of performance guarantees, attracting a CCF of 50 per cent is as under:
    - Bid bonds;
    - Performance bonds and export performance guarantees;
    - Guarantees in lieu of security deposits/earnest money deposits (EMD) for participating in tenders;
    - Retention money guarantees;
    - Warranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to particular transaction.
- 14.3 Treatment of Total Counterparty Credit Risk
  - 14.3.1 The total capital charge for counterparty credit risk will cover the default risk as well as credit migration risk of the counterparty reflected in mark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value adjustments, CVA). Counterparty risk may arise in the context of OTC derivatives and Securities Financing Transactions. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:
    - The transactions generate a current exposure or market value.

- The transactions have an associated random future market value based on market variables.
- The transactions generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a financial instrument against payment.
- Collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some transactions.
- Short-term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly consist of an exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective.
- Netting may be used to mitigate the risk.
- Positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market variables.
- Remargining may be employed.

The '**capital charge for default risk**' will be calculated using **Current Exposure Method** as explained in paragraph 14.3.5 The '**capital charge for CVA risk**' will be calculated as explained in paragraph 14.3.6. The Current Exposure method is applicable only to OTC derivatives.

 14.3.2 Exemption from capital requirements for counterparty risk is permitted for foreign exchange (except gold) contracts which have an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less.

# 14.3.3 **Definitions and general terminology**

**Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)** is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike a firm's exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.

**Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs)** are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, collateralized borrowing and lending (CBLO) and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.

**Hedging Set** is a group of risk positions from the transactions within a single netting set for which only their balance is relevant for determining the exposure amount or EAD under the CCR standardized method.

**Current Exposure** is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in bankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.

**Credit Valuation Adjustment** is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This adjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the market value of the credit risk of both the bank and the counterparty.

**One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment** is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the bank to the counterparty.

#### 14.3.4 **Treatment of Exposure to Central Counterparties**

Presently, treatment of exposures to Central Counterparties for the purpose of capital adequacy is as under:

- (i) The exposures on account of derivatives trading and securities financing transactions (e.g., Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations - CBLOs, Repos) to Central Counter Parties (CCPs) including those attached to stock exchanges for settlement of exchange traded derivatives, will be assigned zero exposure value for counterparty credit risk, as it is presumed that the CCPs' exposures to their counterparties are fully collateralized on a daily basis, thereby providing protection for the CCP's credit risk exposures.
- (ii) A CCF of 100 per cent will be applied to the banks securities posted as collaterals with CCPs and the resultant off-balance sheet exposure will be assigned risk weights appropriate to the nature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities.
- (iii) The deposits kept by banks with the CCPs will attract risk weights appropriate to the nature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities.

When entering into bilateral OTC derivative transactions, banks are required to hold capital to protect against the risk that the counterparty defaults and for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The CVA charge is introduced as part of the Basel III framework as explained in **paragraphs 14.3.5 and 14.3.6 below.**

#### 14.3.5 **Default Risk Capital Charge for CCR**

The exposure amount for the purpose of computing for default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk will be calculated using the **Current Exposure Method (CEM)**  described as under:

- (i) The credit equivalent amount of a market related off-balance sheet transaction calculated using the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure of these contracts. For this purpose, credit equivalent amount will be adjusted for legally valid eligible financial collaterals in accordance with Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques Collateralized Transactions and the provisions held by the bank for CVA losses.
- (ii) The CVA loss will be calculated as a prudent valuation adjustment as per prudent valuation guidance without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments (DVA) which have been deducted from capital. The CVA loss deducted from exposures to determine outstanding EAD is the CVA loss gross of all DVA which have been separately deducted from capital. To the extent DVA has not been separately deducted from a bank's capital, the CVA loss used to determine outstanding EAD will be net of such DVA. Risk Weighted Assets for a given OTC derivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under the Standardized or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This reduction of EAD by CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital charge as per formula given in **Paragraph14.3.6 (ii).**
- (iii) While computing the credit exposure banks may exclude 'sold options', provided the entire premium/fee or any other form of income is received/realized.
- (iv) Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the positive mark-to-market value of these contracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical calculation of the current credit exposure by marking these contracts to market, thus capturing the current credit exposure.
- (v) Potential future credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount of each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero, positive or negative mark-to-market value by the relevant add-on factor indicated below according to the nature and residual maturity of the instrument.
- (vi) For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add-on factors are to be multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract.

| <b>TABLE 13.9</b>              | Credit Conversion Factors for Market-Related Off-Balance Sheet Items |       |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
|                                | Credit Conversion Factors (%)                                        |       |

| Over one year to five years    | 1.00                                                                 | 10.00 |

- (vii) For contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified payment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market value of the contract is zero on these specified dates, the residual maturity would be set equal to the time until the next reset date. However, in the case of interest rate contracts which have residual maturities of more than one year and meet the above criteria, the CCF or add-on factor is subject to a floor of 1.0 per cent.
- (viii) No potential future credit exposure would be calculated for single currency floating/floating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.
- (ix) Potential future exposures should be based on 'effective' rather than 'apparent notional amounts'. In the event that the 'stated notional amount' is leveraged or enhanced by the structure of the transaction, banks must use the 'effective notional amount' when determining potential future exposure. For example, a stated notional amount of USD 1 million with payments based on an internal rate of two times the BPLR/Base Rate would have an effective notional amount of USD 2 million.

### 14.3.6 **Capitalization of mark-to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital charge)**

(i) In addition to the default risk capital requirement for counterparty credit risk, banks are also required to compute an additional capital charge to cover the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value adjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will be calculated in the manner indicated below in para (ii). Banks are not required to include in this capital charge (a) transactions with a central counterparty (CCP); and (b) securities financing transactions (ii) Banks should use the following formula to calculate a portfolio capital charge for CVA risk for their counterparties:

$$
K = 2.33\sqrt{h} \sqrt{\left(\sum_{i} 0.5 w_{i} (M_{i} EAD_{i}^{total} - M_{i}^{hedge} B_{i}) - \sum_{ind} W_{ind} M_{ind} B_{ind}\right)^{2} + \sum_{i} 0.75 w_{i}^{2} (M_{i} EAD_{i}^{total} - M_{i}^{hedge} B_{i})^{2}}
$$

Where;

- h is the one-year risk horizon (in units of a year),  $h = 1$ .
- Wi is the weight applicable to counterparty 'i'. Counterparty 'i' should be mapped to one of the seven weights Wi based on its external rating, as shown in the Table below in the last bullet point.
- EAD<sub>1</sub><sup>total</sup> is the gross exposure at default of counterparty 'i' without taking into account the effect of bilateral netting51 including the effect of collateral as per the existing Current Exposure Method (CEM) as applicable to the calculation of counterparty risk capital charges for suc counterparty by the bank. The exposure should be discounted by applying the factor  $(1-\exp(-0.05*M)$  /(0.05 $*M$ ).
- $\bullet$  B<sub>i</sub> is the notionl of purchased single name CDS hedges (summed if more than one position) referencing counterparty 'i', and used to hedge CVA risk. This notional amount should be discounted by applying the factor  $(1-\exp(-0.05 \cdot M_i^{\text{ hedge}})/(0.05 \cdot M_i^{\text{ hedge}})$ .
- $\bullet$  B<sub>ind</sub> is the full notional of one or more index CDS of purchased protection, used to hedge CVA risk. This notional amount should be discounted by applying the factor  $(1-\exp(0.05^*M_{\text{ind}})/(0.056^*M_{\text{ind}}))$ .
- $W_{ind}$  is the weight applicable to index hedges. The bank must map indices to one of the seven weights Wi based on the average spread of index 'ind'.
- M<sub>i</sub> is the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty 'i'. M<sub>i</sub> is the notional weighted average maturity of all the contracts with counterparty 'i'.
- $M_i^{\text{ hedge}}$  is the maturity of the hedge instrument with notional  $B_i$  (the quantities  $M_i^{\text{ hedge}} B_i$  are to be summed it these are several positions).
- $\bullet$  M<sup>ind</sup> is the maturity of the index hedge 'ind'. In case of more than one index hedge position, it is the notional weighted average maturity.

For any counterparty that is also a constituent of an index on which a CDS is used for hedging counterparty credit risk, the notional amount attributable to that single name

- Banks will have to continuously monitor the capital adequacy position of their counterparty banks so that the effect of any change in the implied ratings is adequately reflected in CVA capital charge calculations.
  - 15.1 Risk Weighted Securitization Exposures:
    - (i) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of an on-balance sheet securitization exposure by multiplying the principal amount (after deduction of specific provisions) of the exposures by the applicable risk weight.
    - (ii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure is computed by multiplying the amount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with issue specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen external credit rating agencies as indicated in the following tables:

| <b>TABLE 13.10</b>                                  |     |    |    |            |     | Securitization Exposures – Risk Weight Mapping to Long-Term Ratings |

- (iii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure in respect of MBS backed by commercial real estate exposure, as defined above, is computed by multiplying the amount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with issue specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen external credit rating agencies as indicated in the following tables.
- (iv) Banks are not permitted to invest in unrated securities issued by an SPV as a part of the securitization transaction. However, securitization exposures assumed by banks which may become unrated or may be deemed to be unrated, would be treated for capital adequacy purposes.

| <b>TABLE 13.10(A)</b>                               | Mapping to Long-term Ratings |     |     |            |           | Commercial Real Estate Securitization Exposures – Risk Weight |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----|-----|------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Domestic Rating Agencies                            | AAA                          | AA  | A   | <b>BBB</b> | <b>BB</b> | B and below or<br>unrated                                     |
| Risk weight for banks other<br>than originators (%) | 100                          | 100 | 100 | 150        | 400       | 1111                                                          |
| Risk weight for originator (%)                      | 100                          | 100 | 100 | 150        |           | 1111                                                          |

- (v) There should be transfer of a significant credit risk associated with the securitized exposures to the third parties for recognition of risk transfer. In view of this, the total exposure of banks to the loans securitized in the following forms should not exceed 20 per cent of the total securitized instruments issued:
  - Investments in equity/subordinate/senior tranches of securities issued by the SPV including through underwriting commitments
  - Credit enhancements including cash and other forms of collaterals including over-collateralization, but excluding the credit enhancing interest only strip
  - Liquidity support.

If a bank exceeds the above limit, the excess amount would be risk weighted at 1111 per cent. Credit exposure on account of interest rate swaps/ currency swaps entered into with the SPV will be excluded from the limit of 20 per cent as this would not be within the control of the bank.

- (vi) If an originating bank fails to meet the requirement laid down, it will have to maintain capital for the securitized assets/ assets sold as if these were not securitized/ sold. This capital would be in addition to the capital which the bank is required to maintain on its other existing exposures to the securitization transaction.
- (vii) The investing banks will assign a risk weight of 1111 per cent to the exposures relating to securitization/ or assignment if the requirements are not met. The higher risk weight of 1111 per cent is applicable with effect from October 01, 2012.
- (viii) Under the transactions involving transfer of assets through direct assignment of cash flows and the underlying securities, the capital adequacy treatment for direct purchase of corporate loans will be as per the rules applicable to corporate loans directly originated by the banks. Similarly, the capital adequacy treatment for direct purchase of retail loans, will be as per the rules applicable to retail portfolios directly originated by banks except in cases where the individual accounts have been classified as NPA, in which case usual capital adequacy norms as applicable to retail NPAs will apply. No benefit in terms of reduced risk weights will be available to purchased retail loans portfolios based on rating because this is not envisaged under the Basel II Standardized Approach for credit risk.
- 15.2 Off-Balance Sheet Securitization Exposures:
  - (i) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of a rated off-balance sheet securitization exposure by multiplying the credit equivalent amount of the exposure by the applicable risk weight. The credit equivalent amount should be arrived at by multiplying the principal amount of the exposure (after deduction of specific provisions) with a 100 per cent CCF, unless otherwise specified.
  - (ii) If the off-balance sheet exposure is not rated, it must be deducted from capital, except an unrated eligible liquidity facility.
- 15.3 Recognition of Credit Risk Mitigants (CRMs):
  - (i) The treatment below applies to a bank that has obtained a credit risk mitigant on a securitization exposure. Credit risk mitigant include guarantees and eligible collateral as specified in these guidelines. Collateral in this context refers to that used to hedge the credit risk of a securitization exposure rather than for hedging the credit risk of the underlying exposures of the securitization transaction.
  - (ii) When a bank other than the originator provides credit protection to a securitization exposure, it must calculate a capital requirement on the covered exposure as if it were an investor in that securitization. If a bank provides protection to an unrated credit enhancement,

it must treat the credit protection provided as if it were directly holding the unrated credit enhancement.

15.4 Re-Securitization Exposures/Synthetic Securitizations/Securitization with Revolving Structures (with or without early amortization features)

At present, banks in India including their overseas branches, are not permitted to assume exposures relating to re-securitization/Synthetic Securitizations/ Securitizations with Revolving Structures (with or without early amortization features). Some of these exposures may be in the nature of re-securitization. For such exposures, the risk weights would be assigned as under:

16.3.3 If an issuer has a long-term exposure with an external long term rating that warrants a risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter-party, whether short-term or long-term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses recognized credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims.

# **16.3 Short-term Ratings**

- 16.3.1 For risk-weighting purposes, short-term ratings are deemed to be issue-specific. They can only be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from the rated facility. They cannot be generalized to other short-term claims. In no event can a short-term rating be used to support a risk weight for an unrated long-term claim. Short-term assessments may only be used for short-term claims against banks and corporates.
- 16.3.2 Notwithstanding the above restriction on using an issue specific short term rating for other short term exposures, the following broad principles will apply. The unrated short term claim on counterparty will attract a risk weight of at least one level higher than the risk weight applicable to the rated short term claim on that counter-party. If a short-term rated facility to counterparty attracts a 20 per cent or a 50 per cent risk-weight, unrated short-term claims to the same counter-party cannot attract a risk weight lower than 30 per cent or 100 per cent respectively.
- 16.3.3 Similarly, if an issuer has a short-term exposure with an external short term rating that warrants a risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter-party, whether long-term or short-term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses recognized credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims.

- 16.3.4 In respect of the issue specific short term ratings the following risk weight mapping shall be adopted by banks:
- 16.3.5 Where '+' or '−' notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating category risk weight should be used for A2 and below, unless specified otherwise. For example,  $A2 + or A2 -$  would be considered to be in the A2 rating category and assigned 50 per cent risk weight.
- 16.3.6 The above risk weight mapping of both long term and short term ratings of the chosen domestic rating agencies would be reviewed annually by the Reserve Bank.

### 16.4 **Use of Unsolicited Ratings**

A rating would be treated as solicited only if the issuer of the instrument has requested the credit rating agency for the rating and has accepted the rating assigned by the agency. As a general rule, banks should use only solicited rating from the chosen credit rating agencies. No ratings issued by the credit rating agencies on an unsolicited basis should be considered for risk weight calculation as per the Standardized Approach.

### 16.5 **Use of Multiple Rating Assessments**

Banks shall be guided by the following in respect of exposures/obligors having multiple ratings from the chosen credit rating agencies chosen by the bank for the purpose of risk weight calculation:

- (i) If there is only one rating by a chosen credit rating agency for a particular claim, that rating would be used to determine the risk weight of the claim.
- (ii) If there are two ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies that map into different risk weights, the higher risk weight should be applied.
- (iii) If there are three or more ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies with different risk weights, the ratings corresponding to the two lowest risk weights should be referred to and the higher of those two risk weights should be applied. *i.e.*, the second lowest risk weight.

### 17. **Capital Charge for Market Risk**

17.1 Introduction

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to capital charge requirement are:

- (i) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; and
- (ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank (both banking and trading books).

### 17.2 **Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks**

- 17.2.1 These guidelines seek to address the issues involved in computing capital charges for interest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign exchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking books. Trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include:
  - (i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category
  - (ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale category
  - (iii) Open gold position limits
  - (iv) Open foreign exchange position limits
  - (v) Trading positions in derivatives, and
  - (vi) Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.
- 17.2.2 Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capital requirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous basis, *i.e.*, at the close of each business day. Banks are also required to maintain strict risk management systems to monitor and control intra-day exposures to market risks.
- 17.2.3 Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities, which have already matured and remain unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. On completion of 90 days delinquency, these will be treated on par with NPAs for deciding the appropriate risk weights for credit risk.

### 17.3 **Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk**

- 17.3.1 This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking positions in debt securities and other interest rate related instruments in the trading book.
- 17.3.2 The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to current market value of these items in bank's trading book. Since banks are required to maintain capital for market risks on an ongoing basis, they are required to mark to market their trading positions on a daily basis. The current market value will be determined as per extant RBI guidelines on valuation of investments.
- 17.3.3 The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated charges, (i) 'specific risk' charge for each security, which is designed to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer, both for short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) and long positions, and (ii) 'general market risk' charge towards interest rate risk in the portfolio, where long and short positions (which is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) in different securities or instruments can be offset.
- 17.3.4 For the debt securities held under AFS category, in view of the possible longer holding period and attendant higher specific risk, the banks shall hold total capital charge for market risk equal to greater of (a) or (b) below:
  - (a) Specific risk capital charge, computed notionally for the AFS securities treating them as held under HFT category (as computed according to Table 13.14: Part A/C/E(i)/F/G/H, as applicable) plus the General Market Risk Capital Charge.
  - (b) Alternative total capital charge for the AFS category computed notionally treating them as held in the banking book (as computed in accordance with Table 13.14: Part B/D/E(ii)/F/G/I, as applicable)

### A. **Specific Risk**

17.3.5 The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer. The specific risk charges for various kinds of exposures would be applied as detailed:

*\** The deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

#### **Notes:**

- (i) In case of banks where no capital adequacy norms have been prescribed by the RBI, the lending/investing bank may calculate the applicable Common Equity Tier 1 and capital conservation buffer of the bank concerned, notionally, by obtaining necessary information from the investee bank and using the capital adequacy norms as applicable to the commercial banks. In case, it is not found feasible to compute applicable Common Equity Tier 1 and capital conservation buffer on such notional basis, the specific risk capital charge of 31.5 per cent or 56.25 per cent, as per the risk perception of the investing bank, should be applied uniformly to the investing bank's entire exposure.
- (ii) In case of banks where capital adequacy norms are not applicable at present, the matter of investments in their capitaleligible instruments would not arise for now. However, this table above will become applicable to them, if in future they issue any capital instruments where other banks are eligible to invest.
- (iii) The existing specific risk capital charges up to 9 per cent have been scaled up to reflect the application of specific risk charge corresponding to risk weight of 125 per cent instead of 100 per cent. For instance the existing specific risk charge for exposure to capital instrument issued by scheduled banks with applicable Common Equity Tier 1 and capital conservation buffer more than 9 per cent and instrument having a residual maturity of less than 6 month is 1.4 per cent. This is scaled up as under: 1.4\*125 per cent =1.75
- (iv) Till such time the investee banks have not disclosed their Basel III capital ratios publicly, the risk weights/capital charges may be arrived at based on the tables/paragraph on Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Market Discipline - New Capital Adequacy Framework.

### B. **General Market Risk**

- 17.3.6 The capital requirements for general market risk are designed to capture the risk of loss arising from changes in market interest rates. The capital charge is the sum of four components:
  - (i) the net short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) or long position in the whole trading book;
  - (ii) a small proportion of the matched positions in each time-band (the 'vertical disallowance');

- (iii) a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time-bands (the 'horizontal disallowance'), and
- (iv) a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate.
- 17.3.7 Separate maturity ladders should be used for each currency and capital charges should be calculated for each currency separately and then summed with no offsetting between positions of opposite sign. In the case of those currencies in which business is insignificant (where the turnover in the respective currency is less than 5 per cent of overall foreign exchange turnover), separate calculations for each currency are not required. The bank may, instead, slot within each appropriate time-band, the net long or short position for each currency. However, these individual net positions are to be summed within each time-band, irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure. The gross positions in each time-band will be subject to the assumed change in yield set out in Table 13.18 with no further offsets.
- 17.3.8 The Basel Committee has suggested two broad methodologies for computation of capital charge for market risks. One is the standardized method and the other is the banks'

internal risk management models method. As banks in India are still in a nascent stage of developing internal risk management models, it has been decided that, to start with, banks may adopt the standardized method. Under the standardized method there are two principal methods of measuring market risk, a 'maturity' method and a 'duration' method. As 'duration' method is a more accurate method of measuring interest rate risk, it has been decided to adopt standardized duration method to arrive at the capital charge. Accordingly, banks are required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each position separately. Under this method, the mechanics are as follows:

- (i) first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument;
- (ii) next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each instrument between 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity of the instrument (see Table 13.15);
- (iii) slot the resulting capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the fifteen time bands as set out in Table 13.15;
- (iv) subject long and short positions (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical disallowance designed to capture basis risk; and
- (v) carry forward the net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting subject to the disallowances set out in Table 13.16.

17.3.9 The measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off balance-sheet instruments in the trading book which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g., forward rate agreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and crosscurrency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions).

### **17.4 Measurement of Capital Charge for Equity Risk**

- 17.4.1 The capital charge for equities would apply on their current market value in bank's trading book. Minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in equities in the trading book is set out below. This is applied to all instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities but not to non-convertible preference shares (which are covered by the interest rate risk requirements described earlier). The instruments covered include equity shares, whether voting or non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, for example: units of mutual funds, and commitments to buy or sell equity. **Specific and General Market Risk**
- 17.4.2 Capital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) will be 11.25 per cent or capital charge in accordance with the risk warranted by external rating (or lack of it) of the counterparty, whichever is higher and specific risk is computed on banks' gross equity positions (*i.e.*, the sum of all long equity positions and of all short equity positions - short equity position is, however, not allowed for banks in India). In addition, the general market risk charge will also be 9 per cent on the gross equity positions. These capital charges will also be applicable to all trading book exposures, which are exempted from capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments.
- 17.4.3 Specific Risk Capital Charge for banks' investment in Security Receipts will be 13.5 per cent (equivalent to 150 per cent risk weight). Since the Security Receipts are by and large illiquid and not traded in the secondary market, there will be no General Market Risk Capital Charge on them.
- 17.4.4 The specific risk charge for bank's investments in the equity of other banks/other financial entities/non-financial entities will be as under:

#### 18. **Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange Risk**

The bank's net open position in each currency should be calculated by summing:

- The net spot position (*i.e.*, all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, denominated in the currency in question);
- The net forward position (*i.e.*, all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position);
- Guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be irrecoverable;
- Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting bank);
- Depending on particular accounting conventions in different countries, any other item representing a profit or loss in foreign currencies;
- The net delta-based equivalent of the total book of foreign currency options

Foreign exchange open positions and gold open positions are at present risk-weighted at 100 per cent. Thus, capital charge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open position is 9 per cent. These open positions, limits or actual whichever is higher, would continue to attract capital charge at 9 per cent. This capital charge is in addition to the capital charge for credit risk on the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items pertaining to foreign exchange and gold transactions.

Aggregation of the capital charge for Market Risks

As explained earlier capital charges for specific risk and general market risk are to be computed separately before aggregation. For computing the total capital charge for market risks, the calculations may be plotted in the following table:

# **Capital Charge for Operational Risk**

# **Definition of Operational Risk**

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions, as well as private settlements.

### **The Measurement Methodologies**

 The New Capital Adequacy Framework outlines three methods for calculating operational risk capital charges in a continuum of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity: (i) the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA); (ii) the Standardized Approach (TSA); and (iii) Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA).

Banks are encouraged to move along the spectrum of available approaches as they develop more sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices.

The New Capital Adequacy Framework provides that internationally active banks and banks with significant operational risk exposures are expected to use an approach that is more sophisticated than the Basic Indicator Approach and that is appropriate for the risk profile of the institution. However, to begin with, banks in India shall compute the capital requirements for operational risk under the Basic Indicator Approach. Reserve Bank will review the capital requirement produced by the Basic Indicator Approach for general credibility, especially in relation to a bank's peers and in the event that credibility is lacking, appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2 will be considered.

### **The Basic Indicator Approach**

 Under the Basic Indicator Approach, banks must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage (denoted as alpha) of positive annual gross income. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average. If negative gross income distorts a bank's Pillar 1 capital charge, Reserve Bank will consider appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2. The charge may be expressed as follows:

$$
\mathbf{KBIA} = \frac{[\Sigma(\mathrm{G11} \dots \mathbf{n} \times \alpha)]}{\mathbf{n}}
$$

KBIA = the capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach

 $GI =$  annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years

 $n =$  number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive

 $\alpha$  = 15 per cent, which is set by the BCBS, relating the industry wide level of required capital to the industry wide level of the indicator.

Gross income is defined as 'Net interest income' plus 'net non-interest income'. It is intended that this measure should:

- (i) be gross of any provisions (e.g., for unpaid interest) and write-offs made during the year;
- (ii) be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers, in addition to fees paid for services that are outsourced, fees received by banks that provide outsourcing services shall be included in the definition of gross income;
- (iii) exclude reversal during the year in respect of provisions and write-offs made during the previous year(s);
- (iv) exclude income recognized from the disposal of items of movable and immovable property;
- (v) exclude realized profits/losses from the sale of securities in the 'held to maturity' category;
- (vi) exclude income from legal settlements in favour of the bank;
- (vii) exclude other extraordinary or irregular items of income and expenditure; and
- (viii) exclude income derived from insurance activities (*i.e.*, income derived by writing insurance policies) and insurance claims in favour of the bank.

Banks are advised to compute capital charge for operational risk under the Basic Indicator Approach as follows:

- (a) Average of [Gross Income \* alpha] for each of the last three financial years, excluding years of negative or zero gross income
- (b) Gross income = Net profit  $(+)$  Provisions and contingencies  $(+)$  operating expenses (Schedule 16)  $(-)$  items (iii) to (viii) of paragraph 9.3.2.
- (c) Alpha =  $15$  per cent

# **Part B: Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)**

The Capital Adequacy Framework rests on three components or three Pillars. Pillar 1 is the Minimum Capital Ratio while Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 are the Supervisory Review Process (SRP) and Market Discipline, respectively.

The objective of the SRP is to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all the risks in their business as also to encourage them to develop and use better risk management techniques for monitoring and managing their risks. This in turn would require a well-defined internal assessment process within banks through which they assure the RBI that adequate capital is indeed held towards the various risks to which they are exposed. The process of assurance could also involve an active dialogue between the bank and the RBI so that, when warranted, appropriate intervention could be made to either reduce the risk exposure of the bank or augment/restore its capital. Thus, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is an important component of the SRP. The main aspects to be addressed under the SRP, and therefore, under the ICAAP, would include:

- (a) The risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribed under Pillar 1;
- (b) The risks that are not at all taken into account by the Pillar 1; and
- (c) The factors external to the bank.

# **Guidelines for the SREP of the RBI and the ICAAP of Banks**

### *Background*

The Basel capital adequacy framework rests on the following three mutually-reinforcing pillars:

- Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements—which prescribes a risk-sensitive calculation of capital requirements that, for the first time, explicitly includes operational risk in addition to market and credit risk.
- Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process (SRP)—which envisages the establishment of suitable risk management systems in banks and their review by the supervisory authority.
- Pillar 3: Market Discipline—which seeks to achieve increased transparency through expanded disclosure requirements for banks.

The Basel Committee also lays down the following four key principles in regard to the SRP envisaged under Pillar 2:

- **Principle 1:** Banks should have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels.
- **Principle 2:** Supervisors should review and evaluate banks' internal capital adequacy assessments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their compliance with the regulatory capital ratios. Supervisors should take appropriate supervisory action if they are not satisfied with the result of this process.
- **Principle 3:** Supervisors should expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum.
- **Principle 4:** Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling below the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a particular bank and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.

It would be seen that the principles 1 and 3 relate to the supervisory expectations from banks while the principles 2 and 4 deal with the role of the supervisors under Pillar 2. Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review Process–SRP) requires banks to implement an internal process, called the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), for assessing their capital adequacy in relation to their risk profiles as well as a strategy for maintaining their capital levels. Pillar 2 also requires the supervisory authorities to subject all banks to an evaluation process, hereafter called Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), and to initiate such supervisory measures on that basis, as might be considered necessary. An analysis of the foregoing principles indicates that the following broad responsibilities have been cast on banks and the supervisors:

### **Banks' Responsibilities:**

- (a) Banks should have in place a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels (Principle 1)
- (b) Banks should operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios (Principle 3)

### **Supervisors' Responsibilities:**

- (a) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank's ICAAP. (Principle 2)
- (b) Supervisors should take appropriate action if they are not satisfied with the results of this process. (Principle 2)

- (c) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank's compliance with the regulatory capital ratios. (Principle 2)
- (d) Supervisors should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum. (Principle 3)
- (e) Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling below the minimum levels. (Principle 4)
- (f) Supervisors should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored. (Principle 4)

Thus, the ICAAP and SREP are the two important components of Pillar 2 and could be broadly defined as follows:

The ICAAP comprises a bank's procedures and measures designed to ensure the following:

- (a) An appropriate identification and measurement of risks;
- (b) An appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the bank's risk profile; and
- (c) Application and further development of suitable risk management systems in the bank.

The SREP consists of a review and evaluation process adopted by the supervisor, which covers all the processes and measures defined in the principles listed above. Essentially, these include the review and evaluation of the bank's ICAAP, conducting an independent assessment of the bank's risk profile, and if necessary, taking appropriate prudential measures and other supervisory actions.

These guidelines seek to provide broad guidance to banks by outlining the manner in which the SREP would be carried out by the RBI, the expected scope and design of their ICAAP, and the expectations of the RBI from banks in regard to implementation of the ICAAP.

The SREP of banks would, thus, be conducted by the RBI periodically, generally, along with the RBI's Annual Financial Inspection (AFI) of banks and in the light of the data in the off-site returns received from banks in the RBI, in conjunction with the ICAAP document, which is required to be submitted every year by banks to the RBI (refer to paragraph 12.3.3.7 below). Through the SREP, the RBI would evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of the ICAAP of banks and the capital requirements derived by them therefrom. While in the course of evaluation, there would be no attempt to reconcile the difference between the regulatory minimum CRAR and the outcome of the ICAAP of a bank (as the risks covered under the two processes are different), banks would be expected to demonstrate to the RBI that the ICAAP adopted by them is fully responsive to their size, level of complexity, scope and scale of operations and the resultant risk profile/exposures, and adequately captures their capital requirements. Such an evaluation of the effectiveness of the ICAAP would help the RBI in understanding the capital management processes and strategies adopted by banks. If considered necessary, the SREP could also involve a dialogue between the bank's top management and the RBI from time to time. In addition to the periodic reviews, independent external experts may also be commissioned by the RBI, if deemed necessary, to perform ad hoc reviews and comment on specific aspects of the ICAAP process of a bank; the nature and extent of such a review shall be determined by the RBI.

# **The Structural Aspects of the ICAAP**

The broad parameters of the ICAAP that banks are required to comply with in designing and implementing their ICAAP are:

- (i) Every bank to have an ICAAP
- (ii) ICAAP to encompass firm-wide risk profile:

General firm-wide risk management principles:

Senior management should understand the importance of taking an integrated, firm-wide perspective of a bank's risk exposure, in order to support its ability to identify and react to emerging and growing risks in a timely and effective manner. The purpose of this guidance is the need to enhance firm-wide oversight, risk management and controls around banks' capital markets activities, including securitization, off-balance sheet exposures, structured credit and complex trading activities.

A sound risk management system should have the following key features:

- Active board and senior management oversight;
- Appropriate policies, procedures and limits;

- Comprehensive and timely identification, measurement, mitigation, controlling, monitoring and reporting of risks;
- Appropriate management information systems (MIS) at the business and firm-wide level; and
- Comprehensive internal controls.

# **Part C: Market Discipline**

### *Guidelines for Market Discipline*

#### **General**

The purpose of Market discipline is to complement the minimum capital requirements (detailed under Pillar 1) and the supervisory review process (detailed under Pillar 2). The aim is to encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes and hence, the capital adequacy of the institution.

In principle, banks' disclosures should be consistent with how senior management and the Board of Directors assess and manage the risks of the bank. Under Pillar 1, banks use specified approaches/methodologies for measuring the various risks they face and the resulting capital requirements. It is believed that providing disclosures that are based on a common framework is an effective means of informing the market about a bank's exposure to those risks and provides a consistent and comprehensive disclosure framework that enhances comparability.

### **Part D: Capital Conservation Buffer Framework**

### *Objective*

The capital conservation buffer (CCB) is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers during normal times (*i.e.*, outside periods of stress) which can be drawn down as losses are incurred during a stressed period. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation rules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements.

Outside the period of stress, banks should hold buffers of capital above the regulatory minimum. When buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is through reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing dividend payments, share buybacks and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new capital from the market as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. However, if a bank decides to make payments in excess of the constraints imposed as explained above, the bank, with the prior approval of RBI, would have to use the option of raising capital from the market equal to the amount above the constraint which it wishes to distribute.

In the absence of raising capital from the market, the share of earnings retained by banks for the purpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirement. It will not be appropriate for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to use future predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. It is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to try and use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. Not only is this irresponsible from the perspective of an individual bank, putting shareholders' interests above depositors, it may also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence, banks in aggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in time when they should be conserving earnings.

The capital conservation buffer can be drawn down only when a bank faces a systemic or idiosyncratic stress. A bank should not choose in normal times to operate in the buffer range simply to compete with other banks and win market share. This aspect would be specifically looked into by Reserve Bank of India during the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process. If, at any time, a bank is found to have allowed its capital conservation buffer to fall in normal times, particularly by increasing its risk weighted assets without a commensurate increase in the Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (although adhering to the restrictions on distributions), this would be viewed seriously. In addition, such a bank will be required to bring the buffer to the desired level within a time limit prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. The banks which draw down their capital conservation buffer during a stressed period should also have a definite plan to replenish the buffer as part of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and strive to bring the buffer to the desired level within a time limit agreed to with Reserve Bank of India during the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process.

The framework of capital conservation buffer will strengthen the ability of banks to withstand adverse economic environment conditions, will help increase banking sector resilience both going into a downturn, and provide the mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Thus, by retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn, banks will be able to help ensure that capital remains available to support the ongoing business operations/ lending activities during the period of stress. Therefore, this framework is expected to help reduce pro-cyclicality.

### **The Framework**

Banks are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, above the regulatory minimum capital requirement of 9 per cent. Banks should not distribute capital (*i.e.*, pay dividends or bonuses in any form) in case capital level falls within this range. However, they will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the conservation range as they experience losses. Therefore, the constraints imposed are related to the distributions only and are not related to the operations of banks. The distribution constraints imposed on banks when their capital levels fall into the range increase as the banks' capital levels approach the minimum requirements. The Table 13.18 below shows the minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at various levels of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios.

| <b>TABLE 13.18</b>  |                                                                                     | Minimum capital conservation standards for individual bank                     |

| $>7.375\% - 8.0\%$  |                                                                                     | 40%                                                                            |
|                     | $>8.0\%$                                                                            | 0%                                                                             |

For example, a bank with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio in the range of 6.125 per cent to 6.75 per cent is required to conserve 80 per cent of its earnings in the subsequent financial year (*i.e.*, payout no more than 20 per cent in terms of dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments is allowed).

The following represents other key aspects of the capital conservation buffer requirements:

- (i) **Elements subject to the restriction on distributions:** Dividends and share buybacks, discretionary payments on other Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments to staff would constitute items considered to be distributions. Payments which do not result in depletion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, (for example include certain scrip dividends) are not considered distributions.
- (ii) **Definition of earnings:** Earnings are defined as distributable profits before the deduction of elements subject to the restriction on distributions mentioned at (i) above. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impact of making such distributions are reversed out. If a bank does not have positive earnings and has a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio less than 8 per cent, it should not make positive net distributions.
- (iii) **Solo or consolidated application:** Capital conservation buffer is applicable both at the solo level (global position) as well as at the consolidated level, *i.e.*, restrictions would be imposed on distributions at the level of both the solo bank and the consolidated group. In all cases where the bank is the parent of the group, it would mean that distributions by the bank can be made only in accordance with the lower of its Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at solo level or consolidated level. For example, if a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.8 per cent and that at consolidated level is 7.4 per cent. It will be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 60 per cent consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >6.75 per cent - 7.375 per cent as per Table 13.18 above. Suppose, a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.6 per cent and that at consolidated level is 6 per cent. It will be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 100 per cent consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1

range of >5.5 per cent - 6.125 per cent as per Table 13.18 on minimum capital conservation standards for individual bank.

### **Part E: Leverage Ratio Framework**

#### *Rationale and Objective*

One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while still showing strong risk based capital ratios. During the most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating the positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and contraction in credit availability. Therefore, under Basel III, a simple, transparent, non-risk based leverage ratio has been introduced. The leverage ratio is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirements. The leverage ratio is intended to achieve the following objectives:

- (a) constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilizing deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy; and
- (b) reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based 'backstop' measure.

### *Definition and Calculation of the Leverage Ratio*

The provisions relating to leverage ratio contained in the Basel III document are intended to serve as the basis for testing the leverage ratio during the parallel run period. The Basel Committee will test a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 per cent during the parallel run period from January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2017.

During the period of parallel run, banks should strive to maintain their existing level of leverage ratio but, in no case the leverage ratio should fall below 4.5 per cent. A bank whose leverage ratio is below 4.5 per cent may endeavor to bring it above 4.5 per cent as early as possible. Final leverage ratio requirement would be prescribed by RBI after the parallel run taking into account the prescriptions given by the Basel Committee.

The leverage ratio shall be maintained on a quarterly basis. The basis of calculation at the end of each quarter is 'the average of the month-end leverage ratio over the quarter based on the definitions of capital (**the capital measure**) and total exposure (**the exposure measure**).

### *Capital Measure*

- (a) The capital measure for the leverage ratio should be based on the new definition of Tier 1 capital .
- (b) Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and should therefore also be deducted from the measure of exposure. That is, the capital and exposure should be measured consistently and should avoid double counting. This means that deductions from Tier 1 capital should also be made from the exposure measure.
- (c) Where a financial entity is included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation, the investments in the capital of these entities are required to be deducted to the extent that that they exceed 10 per cent of the bank's common equity. To ensure that the capital and exposure are measured consistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the assets of such entities included in the accounting consolidation should be excluded from the exposure measure in proportion to the capital that is excluded .
- (d) For example, assume that total assets consolidated by the bank in respect of the subsidiaries which are included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation (e.g., insurance companies) are  $\overline{\epsilon}1200$  crore. Further assume that the total equity investment of a bank in such subsidiaries is 15 per cent of the bank's common equity. In this case, investment equal to 10 per cent of the bank's equity will be risk weighted at 250 per cent and the remaining 5 per cent will be deducted from common equity. Of the consolidated assets of

 $\text{\textsterling}1200$  crore,  $\text{\textsterling}400$  crore {1200\*(5 per cent/15 per cent)} will be excluded from the exposure measure.

### *Exposure Measure*

#### **General Measurement Principles**

The exposure measure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting measure of exposure. In order to measure the exposure consistently with financial accounts, the following should be applied by banks:

- (a) on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures will be net of specific provisions and valuation adjustments (*e.g.*, prudent valuation adjustments for AFS and HFT positions, credit valuation adjustments);
- (b) physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not allowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and
- (c) netting of loans and deposits is not allowed.

# **On-Balance Sheet Items**

Banks should include all items of assets reported in their accounting balance sheet for the purposes of calculation of the leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments for Securities Financing Transactions (e.g. repo and reverse repo agreements, CBLO) and derivatives:

#### *(i) Repurchase agreements and securities finance*

Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are a form of secured funding and therefore, an important source of balance sheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks should calculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:

- (a) The accounting measure of exposure; and
- (b) Without netting various long and short positions with the same counterparty.

### *(ii) Derivatives*

Derivatives create two types of exposure: an 'on-balance sheet' present value reflecting the fair value of the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or negative depending on the performance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure representing the underlying economic interest of the contract. Banks should calculate exposure in respect of derivatives, including where a bank sells protection using a credit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:

- (a) the accounting measure of exposure (positive MTM value) plus an add-on for potential future exposure calculated according to the Current Exposure Method; and
- (b) without netting the MTM values and PFEs in respect of various long and short positions with the same counterparty.

### *(iii) Other Off-Balance Sheet Items*

Banks should calculate the off balance sheet items for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying a uniform 100 per cent credit conversion factor (CCF). However, for any commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank without prior notice, a CCF of 10 per cent may be appropriate.

Effective implementation of Basel III is needed for developing the resilience of the banking sector to future shocks.. In general, Basel III will increase the capital requirements on Indian banks. The current capital adequacy levels for the Indian banking system are comfortable.

It is imperative for banks to meet the Basel-III regulatory norms by March 2019. According to the norms laid down by RBI, Indian banks have to maintain a minimum common equity ratio of 8% and total capital ratio of 11.5% by 2019. As of March 2017, public sector banks maintained an average common equity ratio of 8.5%. Four public sector banks (PSBs) are however struggling and are under the prompt corrective action plan of the RBI. According to RBI estimates, public sector banks would require  $\bar{\tau}$  lakh crore while the entire banking sector would require an additional capital requirement of  $\overline{5}5$  lakh crore to meet the norms by 2019. Banks may not be able to raise the required capital, which would curtail their ability to lend. This comes at a time when stressed assets of banks rose to  $\overline{z}$ 7.4 lakh crore at the end of March 2017 from  $\overline{z}$ 7 lakh crore a year ago. Ratings agency Moody's in a report had said that 11 PSBs will require external equity capital of about ₹70,000–95,000 crore, to meet requirements under Basel-III as against the government's budget of `20,000 crore for capital infusion till 2018–19.

**Equities:** Capital charge for general market risk for equities is 9 per cent. Thus, general market risk capital charge on equities is  $\overline{5}54$  crore.

### *(c)* Total Charge for Market Risk

Total capital charge for general market risk is ( $\overline{35.64}$  crore +  $\overline{54}$  crore)  $\overline{889.64}$  crore. Adding the capital charges for specific risk as well as general market risk would give the total capital charge for the trading book of interest rate related instruments and equities. Therefore, capital charge for Market Risks =  $\overline{5}118.58$ crore + ₹89.64 crore, *i.e.*, ₹208.22 crore.

### *(d)* Capital Charge for Operational Risk

It is 15 per cent of the annual gross income over the previous three years ( $\overline{(100 \text{ core} *0.15)} = \overline{(15 \text{ core} *0.15)}$ 

To facilitate computation of CRAR for the whole book, this capital charge needs to be converted into equivalent risk weighted assets. In India, the minimum CRAR is 9 per cent.

Hence, the capital charge could be converted to risk weighted assets by multiplying the capital charge by (100 ÷ 9), Thus risk weighted assets for market risk is  $208.22*(100 \div 9) = \overline{2}313.55$  crore and for operational risk is  $15*(100/9) = ₹166.67$  crore.

### **Regional Rural Banks**

A new category of scheduled banks came into existence in 1975 when 6 regional rural banks (RRBs) came into existence under the Regional Rural Banks Ordinance, 1975. This ordinance was promulgated by the Government of India on September 26, 1975. The ordinance was subsequently replaced by the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976.

Although cooperative and commercial banks achieved a high reach and disbursement of credit, there existed a vast gap in the area of rural credit. In order to fill up this gap, a new set up of banks, namely, RRBs was established. RRBs were set up as institutions which combine the local feel and familiarity with rural problems, which the cooperatives possess and the degree of business organization, ability to mobilize deposits, access to central money markets, and modernized outlook which commercial banks have. The major objective of setting up RRBs was to develop the rural economy by providing for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry, and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans, and small entrepreneurs.

The authorized capital of each RRB is  $\bar{\tau}$ 1 crore and the issued capital is  $\bar{\tau}$ 25 lakh. Of the issued capital, 50 per cent is authorized by the Government of India, 15 per cent by the concerned state government and the balance, namely, 35 per cent by the sponsor bank. Each RRB is sponsored by a public sector bank, which provides assistance in the form of subscription to its share capital, managerial and financial assistance, and help in the recruitment and training of personnel.

### **Objectives of Setting-up RRBs**

- Development of agriculture, trade, commerce industry, and other productive activities in rural areas.
- Provide credit and other facilities to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers and small entrepreneurs.

Every RRB is authorized to carry on and transact the business of banking as defined in Section (5b) and Section 6(1) of the Banking Regulation Act. The RBI can grant assistance to RRBs by way of loans and advances from the National Agricultural Credit (Stabilization) Fund under Sections 46A and 46B. RRBs are required to maintain a cash reserve ratio of three per cent. They are not liable to pay income tax as they are deemed to be cooperative societies.

The number of RRBs rose from six in 1975 to 196 in 1987. These 196 RRBs operated in 585 districts with a network of 14,520 branches excluding satellite branches and extension counters. RRBs branch network forms nearly 37 per cent of the total rural branch network and 15 per cent of the total semi-urban branch network of all scheduled commercial banks. The massive expansion of their branch network enabled them to expand banking activities in the unbanked areas and mobilize rural savings. Although RRBs are spread over all the states, they have a major presence in north-eastern (34 per cent of branches), eastern (30 per cent) in and central (32 per cent) regions. In these states, the banking system mainly exists in the form of RRBs. Due to a higher presence in these areas, their share in total number of deposit accounts is significantly higher (18 per cent to 29 per cent) in these states vis-a vis only 12 per cent at all India level. RRBs have provided financial services to the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme for giving an impetus to micro-finance and are also functioning as self-help promoting institutions (SHPIs) with grant assistance from NABARD on account of non-availability of good NGOs in these states. Likewise, seven sponsor banks viz, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, United Bank of India, and UCO Bank account for more than three-fifths of the RRBs. RRBs are at par with scheduled commercial banks with respect to priority sector lending, investment avenues, credit discipline, and transparency. RRBs have carved out a niche for themselves in terms of geographical coverage, clientele outreach, business volume, and contributions for development of the rural economy. But these RRBs are characterized by low productivity, high transaction costs, negative margins, low recovery rates and high non-performing assets (NPAs). A viability-based review of RRBs shows that the loss-incurring RRBs are concentrated in four states, namely, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan and in five sponsor banks, namely, CBI, UCO Bank, SBI, BOI, and BOB. Their common characteristics included low productivity, high transaction costs, lower CD ratio, negative margins, low recovery rates, and high NPAs. The Union Budget 2004–05 made the sponsor banks 'squarely accountable' for the performance of RRBs under their control. According to the Reserve Bank, the problems faced by Regional Rural Banks include lack of dynamism/ motivation of the chief executive officer, inadequate interest taken by sponsor banks, sub-optimal size and restrictions on expenditure for business promotion due to accumulated losses. Both sponsor banks and rural banks compete with each other to grab a larger business share in the rural market. Hence, there is a need to empower RRBs to compete and survive in the emerging banking environment. They need full functional autonomy to make them financially stronger and increase their profitability.

As RRBs are important financial institutions in the rural credit structure, several measures were initiated towards strengthening them and making them vibrant channels of credit delivery. Some of the initiatives undertaken are:

- 1. A process of state-wise amalgamation of RRBs sponsored by the same sponsor bank was initiated in 2005 to take advantages of the economies of scale and reduce their operational costs. After the amalgamation, RRBs would have a three-tier structure consisting of a head office, controlling offices and branches. The middle tier has been envisaged with a view to step up the rural lending, for which the centre has set steep targets for all credit agencies. The controlling office in the middle tier will control 50 or more branches and have the power to sanction and supervise credit flow. This office will also have decision-making powers with regard to general administration, human resource development and monitoring. As a result of the amalgamation process, the number of RRBs in the country declined from 196 to 56 at the end of June 2016 with a network of 20,904 branches covering 644 notified districts in 27 states and the UT of Puducherry. To sum up, there have been two broad phases in the amalgamation of RRBs. In the first phase (September 2005–March 2010), RRBs of the same sponsor banks within a State were amalgamated bringing down their number to 82 from 196. In the second and ongoing phase, starting from October 2012, geographically closest RRBs within a State under different sponsor banks would be amalgamated to have just one RRB in medium-sized States and two/ three RRBs in large States.
- 2. NABARD has permitted the RRBs to relocate their loss-making branches to good business locations/centers keeping in view the objective of building up sustainable rural financial institutions. Further, loss-incurring RRBs have been allowed to convert into satellite/

• Each RRB is sponsored by a public sector bank.

mobile offices provided such conversion would not impair the performance of service area obligations.

- 3. RRBs have been given greater autonomy to enlarge their business activities. They have also been allowed to open currency chests, conduct State government business as sub-agents of sponsor banks, take up corporate agency business without risk participation for distribution of all types of insurance products and open NRO/FCNR accounts, subject to certain conditions.
- 4. The branch licensing policy has been liberalized and the norms for opening new branches in hitherto uncovered districts have been relaxed.
- 5. All RRBs are required to disclose their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) in their balance sheets and a road-map for achieving the desired CRAR norms would be drawn up by the RBI.
- 6. RRBs are being equipped in terms of technology-computerization and introducing core banking solutions-to provide efficient customer service to their clientele.
- 7. The report of committee under the chairmanship of Dr Y.S.P. Thorat, then Chairman, NABARD to examine and lay down parameters for staffing norms in RRBs and suggest norms and procedures for new recruitments is under consideration of Government.
- 8. RRBs with negative net-worth are in the process of being re-capitalized, A sum total of  $\overline{z}2,188$ crore was infused as additional capital support to 187 out of 196 RRBs through six phases of recapitalization of the loss-making RRBs till January 2000. Out of 187 RRBs, 158 RRBs were fully recapitalized and 29 RRBs partially. The government did not recapitalize any RRBs during 2000–01. The recapitalization of 27 RRBs with negative networth, in a phased manner, was announced in the Union Budget of 2007–08. The amount required for recapitalization of  $\overline{\epsilon}1$ ,795.97 crore was contributed in the ratio of 50:35:15 by the government of India (GoI) sponsor banks and State Governments.

With a view to bringing the CRAR of RRBs to at least 9 per cent, the Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty Committee recommended recapitalisation support to the extent of  $\overline{5}.2,200$  crore to 40 RRBs in 21 States. The recapitalisation process started in 2010–11. The share of Central Government in respect of some RRBs could not be released in the absence of the release of the share of State Governments. Therefore, the scheme of recapitalisation was extended upto 31st March, 2014. A total amount of  $\bar{\xi}$ 1086. 70 crore, as on 31st March, 2014, was released to 39 RRBs including the Central Madhya Pradesh Gramin Bank.

The Union Cabinet gave its approval for extension for the next three years, that is upto 2016- 17 of the scheme of recapitalisation of weak Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). These banks are unable to maintain their minimum Capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent. This recapitalisation will help them improve this ratio.

The CRAR of 56 RRBs as on 31 March, 2015 ranged from 20.29 per cent (Chhattisgarh Rajya Gramin Bank) to4.82 per cent (Nagaland Rural Bank). Four RRBs viz. Nagaland Rural Bank, Odisha Gramya Bank, Manipur Rural

Bank and Ellaquai Dehati Bank had CRAR less than 9 per cent. Recapitalisation assistance had been released to these RRBs.

A strong capital structure and minimum required level of CRAR will ensure financial stability of RRBs which will enable them to play a greater role in financial inclusion and meeting the credit requirements of rural areas.

- 9. RRBs have been allowed to enhance their resource base issue, issue credit/debit cards, set up ATMs and handle pension and other government business as subagents.
- 10. The government in the Union Budget 2007–08 notified that RRBs will cover 49 uncovered districts and take up aggressive branch expansion. Of the proposed 678 branches, 268 branches visà-vis 554 licenses issued by RBI, were opened as at end-March 2008.
- 11. The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securitization of Interest (SARFAESI) Act was extended for loans advanced by RRBs.
- 12. Performance-linked cash incentives for the chairpersons of RRBs were introduced by the GoI in 2009. The modified performance evaluation matrix (PEM) for computation of incentives of the chairpersons of RRBs, similar to revised PEM developed for whole time directors of PSBs was approved by GoI in consultation with NABARD. The revised PEM has come into effect from financial year 2015–16.
- 13. RRB (Amendment) Act, 2015, was notified by GoI on 12 May 2015.The amendment has enhanced the authorised capital of RRBs to  $\overline{z}2,000$  crore and has enabled RRBs to raise capital from sources other than existing stakeholders. The other sources may include accessing the capital market or private placement.

14. NABARD provides both long-term and short-term refinance support to RRBs. NABARD extends long-term (LT) refinance support for asset creation and capital formation, which are critical for agricultural growth and rural development through SCBs, RRBs and cooperative banks. Refinance is available for agriculture and allied activities, as well as off-farm activities with repayment periods ranging from18 months to 15 years.

RRBs are focusing their attention on the attainment of sustainable viability, improved customer services, new and innovative loan products and diversified business portfolio. The RRBs are now being merged with their sponsor banks. The reduction in number of RRBs will increase their size, thus enabling them to take advantage of economies of scale and also, enabling sponsor banks to manage their affairs efficiently. It is expected that because of their unique position, they will play a very useful role in financial inclusion.

## **Conclusion**

In the last few years, the health of banking system has improved in profitability, productivity, asset quality and capital adequacy. Amid stiff competition from private sector banks and the turbulent economic environment, the SCBs' annual profit after tax (PAT) expanded by 48.0 per cent in 2016- 17 as against a decline of 61.6 per cent in 2015-16, mainly due to higher increase in other operating income (OOI)through trading in securities and lower rise in risk provisions while non-performing assets increased. The Indian banking sector withstood the repercussions of the global finanical crisis and emerged as sound and efficient sector.

The New Basel Accord has been implemented since April 2009. Banks will require a large amount of funds and personnel expertise to manage risk. Banks will be required to put in place systems for internal controls and risk management.Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) shall converge with IFRS converged Indian accounting standards (Ind AS) with effect from accounting periods beginning April 1, 2018. In order to prepare the banks for changes under the Ind AS, RBI mandated them to submit proforma Ind AS financial statements from the half year ended September 30, 2016.

• Because of their unique position as local level institutions, RRBs will play a useful role in financial inclusion.

Internet banking is gaining ground. Internet allows services to be provided from anywhere in the world but it carries high risks for banks. This will require continuous vigilance on the part of banks and coordination of regulation at the international level.

As the prime borrowers are increasingly borrowing abroad, banks need to diversify into less risky retail banking, explore a huge segment of business that is pining for bank funds, abandon traditional reliance on collateral and develop the skills to assess business potential, while making lending decisions. Banks have started taking interest in building the fee income stream with the advent of capital adequacy norms for banks. Fee income represents the income earned on services provided by the bank like demand drafts, telegraphic transfers, brokerage or commission earned on forex transactions, distribution of third party products like mutual funds, insurance, and financial advisory services. Fee income is a relatively easier way to increase revenues as the business does not involve any fund based exposure like a loan or cash advance. The trading income on investments was high for the banks under the soft interest rate regime. With interest rate hardening now, profits from treasury operations have gone down for most banks. Banks will have to book depreciation in their portfolio—depreciation would be adjusted against profits on treasury income. The greater the share of treasury income, the higher is the degree of volatility in bank's profits. Hence, a very high dependence on treasury earnings is not a sign of strength in earnings growth. Banks should focus on their core business, increase their fee-based income and cut down their costs.

Public sector banks need to focus on systems, reskilling people, and growing their loan portfolios.

The function of banking is no longer acceptance of deposits for lending. Banking today refers to intermediation and managing risks. Banks will have to focus not only on capital adequacy but also on capital efficiency–how quickly capital flows to its efficient use. To sum up, banks need to develop sound corporate governance practices to face the challenges of the changing future scenario.

### **Cooperative Banking**

#### **Cooperative Banking**

- Urban Cooperative Banks
- Rural Cooperative Banks

Cooperative banks came into existence with the enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act of 1904 which provided for the formation of cooperative credit societies. Subsequently, in 1912, a new act was passed which provided for the establishment of cooperative central banks. Cooperative credit institutions play a pivotal role in the financial system of the economy in terms of their reach, volume of operations, and the purpose they serve.

Cooperative banks fill in the gaps of banking needs of small and medium income groups not adequately met through by the public and private sector banks. The cooperative banking system supplements the efforts of the commercial banks in mobilizing savings and meeting the credit needs of the local population.

A cooperative bank is member promoted and has to be registered with the state-based Registrar of Cooperative Societies. It functions with the rule of 'one member one vote' and on 'no-profit, no loss basis'.

The cooperative credit sector in India comprises rural cooperative credit institutions and urban cooperative banks. The rural cooperative credit institutions comprise of institutions such as state cooperative banks, district central cooperative banks, and primary agricultural credit societies, which specialise in short-term credit, and institutions such as state cooperative agriculture and rural development banks and primary cooperative agriculture and rural development banks, which specialise in long-term credit.

Urban cooperative banks (UCBs) are mostly engaged in retail banking. They are not permitted to deal in foreign exchange directly because of the high risks involved in forex business. Only three UCBs, namely, the Saraswat Cooperative Bank Limited, the Bombay Mercantile Cooperative Bank Limited, and the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Limited, have been authorized by the Reserve Bank to deal in foreign exchange. Their exposure to non-fund business like issuance of bank guarantees and letters of credit is also limited. Their exposure to corporate (wholesale) banking is also limited due to factors such as small size of their balance sheet and inadequate expertise.

UCBs expanded by leaps and bounds in the 1970s and in the 1990s. Both these decades were periods of high economic growth which led to a great demand for funds inadequately met by public sector banks. In 1993, the Narasimham Committee recommended the liberalization of norms for cooperative banks Organizational Structure of Cooperative Credit Institutions which led to a surge in the number of cooperative banks. There are a large number of UCBs in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. UCBs are included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, if their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) are at least  $\overline{100}$  crore and their overall functioning in terms of socket parameters is satisfactory.

Cooperative banks came under the purview of the Banking Regulations Act only in 1966. UCBs are supervised by the RBI, while rural cooperative credit societies are supervised by the NABARD. State registrars of cooperative societies also regulate certain functions of both urban and rural cooperative banks/societies. Multi-State UCBs are regulated by the union government as well and are registered under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act. The RBI is the regulatory and supervisory authority of UCBs for their banking operations while managerial aspects come under the purview of the state governments under their respective cooperative societies act. UCBs area of operation mostly confines to a single district or the adjoining districts. Only UCBs with  $\overline{50}$  crore net owned funds or above can extend their area of operation to the entire country.

### **Urban Cooperative Banks**

UCBs mobilize savings from the middle and low income urban groups and purvey credit to the weaker sections. They cater to the needs of small borrowers in the non-agricultural sector. The UCBs are varied and heterogeneous is terms of geographical spread, size, strength, levels of professionalism and performance and customer segments UCBs rely mostly on deposits as source of funds. The members bring in the share capital which cannot be withdrawn before the minimum lock-in period. UCBs are not permitted to issue shares at a premium. UCBs were brought under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 in 1966. (As applicable to cooperative societies (AACS)). UCBs are registered as societies under the cooperative Societies Act of the respective state governments, and UCBs that have a multistate presence are registered under the Multi-state Cooperative Societies Act administered by the Government of India. The size of cooperative banks is comparatively smaller than that of commercial banks. Moreover, the cooperative structure in India gets a preferential treatment and regulations are relatively soft for this sector. The UCBs are regulated by three authorities: the central government (in case of banks havingmulti-state presence), state governments and the RBI. This multi-authority regulation has resulted in overlapping jurisdiction and difficulties in regulating these banks.

UCBs are categorized as scheduled and non-scheduled. There are Mahila (women) UCBs, Scheduled Caste/Tribe UCBs and salary earners UCBs. Around 80 per cent of the UCBs are concentrated in five states, namely, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka which account for 72 per cent of total number of UCBs. There were 1574 UCBs with 7,670 branches as at end-March 2016 and they provided credit to around 7 million borrowers aggregating  $\overline{597,918}$  crore.

The RBI grants licenses to cooperative banks based on certain entry point norms. Initially, the entry norms for cooperative banks was very liberal. The RBI revised these norms in August 2000 prescribing four categories based on population criterion. According to the new norms, UCBs should have:

- a minimum share capital of  $\overline{\tau}4$  crore and membership of at least 3,000, if the population is over 10 lakh;
- a minimum share capital of  $\bar{\tau}2$  crore and membership of at least 2,000 if the population is between five to 10 lakh;
- a minimum share capital of  $\bar{\tau}$ one crore and membership of at least 1,500 for population of one to five lakh; and
- a minimum share capital of  $\overline{\tau}25$  lakh and membership of at least 500 for population of less than one lakh. The number of licensed UCBs increased from 1,849 to 1,937 between end March 2000 and end March 2001.

New UCBs will have to achieve the prescribed share capital and membership before license is issued to them.

On October 30, 2003, the Government of India issued a notification enhancing the minimum demand and time liabilities of a cooperative bank to be included in second schedule of the RBI. As per this notification, the minimum demand and time liabilities that a cooperative bank should have to qualify for inclusion in second schedule has been enhanced to  $\bar{\tau}$ 250 crore from  $\bar{\tau}$ 100 crore.

There is a two-tier regulatory structure for UCBs. Banks falling under the following categories are classified as Tier I banks: (i) unit banks, *i.e.,* banks having a single branch/head office and banks with deposits below  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore, whose branches are located in a single district; (ii) banks with deposits below  $\bar{\tau}$ 100 crore having branches in more than one district, provided the branches are in contiguous districts, and deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at least 95 per cent of the total deposits and advances, respectively, of the bank; (iii) banks with deposits below  $\bar{\tau}100$ crore, whose branches were originally in a single district but subsequently, became multi-district due to reorganization of the district. The deposit base of  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore would be determined on the basis of average of fortnightly net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in the financial year concerned and that of advances on the basis of fortnightly average in the financial year concerned. Rest of the UCBs are categorized as Tier II banks.

• Urban cooperative banks mobilize savings from the middle and low income urban groups and purvey credit to the weaker sections. They cater to the needs of small borrowers in the nonagricultural sector.

The number of Tier II UCBs was 447 at end-March 2015. The number of UCBs which held larger sizes of deposits and advances increased. There were 52 scheduled UCBs at end-March 2016. The number of scheduled multi-state UCBs was 31and that of non-scheduled single-state UCBs was 1,502 by end-March 2016.

### **Supervision and Inspection of UCBs**

### **Some Sheduled UCBs**

- Abhyudaya Cooperative Bank Ltd
- Ahmedabad Mercantile Cooperative Bank Ltd
- Amanath Cooperative Bank Ltd, Bangalore
- Andhra Pradesh Mahesh Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd
- Bharat Cooperative Bank (Mumbai) Ltd
- Cosmos Cooperative Urban Bank Ltd
- Goa Urban
- Cooperative Bank Ltd • Jalgaon Janata
- Sahakari Bank Ltd • Karad Urban
- Cooperative Bank Ltd • Kalupur Commercial
- Cooperative Bank Ltd • Sangli Urban
- Cooperative Bank Ltd
- Saraswat Cooperative Bank Ltd, Bombay
- The Akola Urban Cooperative Bank Ltd, Akola

The RBI undertakes audit and on-site inspection of the scheduled and weak UCBs annually, whereas well-functioning non-scheduled UCBs are inspected once in three years and all other UCBs are inspected once in two years. A rating system of evaluating performance finalized for UCBs and this was implemented for scheduled UCBs from March, 2003.

The periodicity of carrying out inspections is too large. Moreover, this inspection is not regularly carried out as the number of UCBs has increased. Hence, a system of continuous off-site supervision has been put in place through a set of periodical prudential returns which cover asset and liability position, profitability, non-performing assets, and details on credit portfolio and large exposures. Besides, various measures such as close monitoring of the submission of statutory returns by the banks, and special scrutiny of their books of accounts in case of default in maintaining CRR/SLR have been initiated to step up supervisory efforts towards banks developing serious financial problems after they received licenses.

All scheduled UCBs and other UCBs with high level of transactions in government securities were advised by the RBI to conduct special audits by chartered accountants.

The off-site surveillance system for supervision of all scheduled UCBs was extended to nonscheduled banks with deposit base of over  $\overline{\tau}100$  crore with effect from June 2004.

**Statutory Reserve Requirements** The scheduled UCBs are required to maintain a cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 4 per cent of the net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). Statutory liquidity ratio to be maintained is 20.

### **Investments in Non-SLR Securities by UCBs**

- **1. Prudential limit:** The Non-SLR investments will be limited to 10 per cent of a bank's total deposits as on March 31 of the previous year.
- **2. Instruments:** UCBs may invest in the following instruments:
  - a. 'A' or equivalent *and higher* rated Commercial Papers (CPs), debentures and bonds.
  - b. Units of Debt Mutual Funds and Money Market Mutual Funds.
- **3. Restrictions**
  - a. Investment in perpetual debt instruments is not permitted.
  - b. Investment in unlisted securities should be subject to a minimum rating prescribed at (ii) above, and should not exceed 10 per cent of the total non-SLR investments at any time. Where banks have already exceeded the said limit, no further investment in such securities will be permitted.
  - c. Investment in deep discount/zero coupon bonds should be subject to the minimum rating as stated above and comparable market yields for the residual duration.
  - d. Investment in units of mutual funds, other than units of debt mutual funds and money market mutual funds, are not permitted. The existing holding in units of mutual funds other than debt mutual funds and money market mutual funds, including those in UTI should be disinvested. Till such time that they are held in the books of the bank, they will be reckoned as non-SLR investments for the purpose of the limit at (i) above. The banks should, however, review risk management policy in place that ensures that they do not have disproportionate exposure in any one scheme of a mutual fund.
  - e. Non-SLR investment, other than in units of debt mutual funds and money market mutual funds*,* and CPs, shall be in instruments with an original maturity of over one year.
  - f. Fresh investments in shares of All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) will not be permitted. The existing share holding in these institutions may be phased out and till such time they are held in the books of the bank, they will be reckoned as Non-SLR investments for the purpose of the limit at (i) above.
  - g. All fresh investments under Non-SLR category should be classified under held for trading (HFT)/available for sale (AFS) categories only and marked to market as applicable to these categories of investments.

- h. All non-SLR investments will be subject to the prescribed prudential single/group counter party exposure limits.
- i. All transactions for acquisition/sale of non-SLR investments in secondary market may be undertaken only with commercial banks/primary dealers as counterparties. SLR investments are the most preferred form of investment for UCBs.

## **Placement of Deposits with Other Banks by UCBs**

- **1. Prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure limit:** The total amount of deposits placed by an UCB with other banks (inter-bank) **for all purposes** including call money/ notice money, and deposits, if any, placed for availing clearing facility, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, remittance facility and non-fund based facilities like bank guarantee (BG), letter of credit (LC), etc., shall not exceed 20 per cent of its total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous year. The balances held in deposit accounts with commercial banks and in permitted scheduled UCBs and investments in certificate of Deposits issued by commercial banks, being inter bank exposures, will be included in this 20 per cent limit.
- **2. Prudential inter-bank counter party limit:** Within the prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure limit, deposits with any single bank should not exceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank's total deposit liabilities as on March 31, of the previous year.
- **3. Exemptions from the prudential limit:** Non-scheduled UCBs in Tier I have been exempted from maintaining SLR in Government and other approved securities up to 15 per cent of their NDTL provided the amount is held in interest bearing deposits with the Public Sector Banks and IDBI bank Ltd. These deposits are exempted from the prudential limit on inter-bank exposure limits.

As per the provisions of Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS), deposits placed by UCBs with the higher financing agencies in the cooperative sector, viz., DCCBs/StCBs would be reckoned as SLR assets to the extent they are not encumbered.

However, when a UCB avails of a loan from a DCCB/StCB with which it is maintaining deposits, for the purpose of computation of SLR, the amount of loan availed from the DCCB/StCB, would be deducted from the deposits, irrespective of whether lien has been marked on such deposits or not.

- 4. The amount of deposits placed by a non-scheduled UCB with any scheduled UCB should not exceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank's total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of previous year. The total inter-UCB deposits accepted by a scheduled UCB should not exceed 10 per cent of its total deposit liabilities as on March 31st of the previous financial year as hither to.
- 5. Keeping in view the above prudential limits, UCBs may formulate a policy taking into account their funds position, liquidity and other needs for placement of deposits with other banks, the cost of funds, expected rate of return and interest margin on such deposits, the counter party risk, etc. and place it before their Board of Director. The Board should review the position at least at half yearly interval.

**Existing Mahila Banks** which conform to the entry point norms for general category banks, can enrol male members up to a limit of 25 per cent of their total regular membership, subject to compliance by the banks with their respective bye-laws.

**Priority Sector Lending** Priority sector lending target for UCBs was brought at par with the target applicable to commercial banks, *i.e.*, 40 per cent of the adjusted bank credit (ABC) (total loans and advances plus investments made by UCBs in non-SLR bonds) or credit equivalent amount of off balance sheet exposure (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year.

But there are no penal provisions for non-attainment of targets to priority sector and weaker sections. However, there are indirect incentives such as branch expansion, expansion of areas of operation, and attainment of scheduled status, which are dependent on the attainment of priority sector/weaker section targets by banks.

**Lending to the Stock Market** The RBI put a stop on lending by the UCBs directly or indirectly against security of stocks. UCBs were also advised to unwind existing lending to stockbrokers or direct investment in shares on the contracted dates.

It was proposed to allow UCBs to grant loans to individuals against security of shares, subject to the following parameters.

- Loans against shares/debentures may be granted to individuals to meet contingencies and personal needs or for subscribing to rights or new issues of shares/debentures or for purchase in the secondary market. Loans against primary/collateral security of shares/debentures will be limited upto  $\bar{\tau}$  five lakh, if the security is in physical form and upto  $\bar{\tau}10$  lakh, if the security is in demat form. Aggregate of all such loans should be within the overall ceiling of 20 per cent of the owned funds of the bank, and margin of 40 per cent should be maintained in all cases of such loans.
- It is essential that before accepting shares as security, UCBs should put in place a risk management system. UCBs should also have audit committee of their boards of directors and all the approved loan proposals should be placed before the audit committee at least once in two months. Details of loans sanctioned should be reported to the board in the subsequent board meeting. The management and audit committee should ensure that all loans against shares are made only to those individuals who are not in any way connected with any stock-broking activity or stock-broking entity.
- UCBs which have outstanding loans to individuals can renew them upto permissible amounts beyond the contracted date on merits, subject to the above conditions.
- UCBs should ensure that there is no direct investment by them in either primary or secondary market under any circumstances.

**Deployment of Funds** UCBs can grant loans to individuals against security of shares within the overall limit of 20 per cent of owned funds of the bank, subject to certain restrictions.

**Advances** UCBs cannot extend unsecured credit beyond `50,000 per borrower. As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, UCBs were advised (a) to fix the prudential exposure limits at 15 per cent and 40 per cent of the capital funds in case of single borrower and group of borrowers respectively. UCBs cannot extend fund based/nonfund based facilities to builders/contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.

**Interest on Deposits** UCBs are allowed to offer higher interest rates on savings and current accounts by 1.0 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, vis-a-vis the commercial banks. Higher interest rates have been allowed to facilitate deposit mobilization by UCBs.

**Refinance Facilities** The RBI extends refinance at the bank rate to UCBs against the advances granted by them to the tiny/cottage industries. Since 2000–01, NABARD has designated scheduled UCBs as eligible institutions for drawing refinance in respect of loans issued for rural non-farm sector, including rural housing and for other agricultural activities.

**Long-term Deposits** UCBs are permitted to raise term deposits for a minimum period of not less than five years, which will be eligible to be treated as Tier II capital.

**Share Linkage Norms** Borrowings from UCBs are linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members. At present, the shareholding requirement is 2.5 per cent for secured borrowings and 5 per cent for unsecured borrowings. The extant share linking norm may be applicable for member's shareholdings upto the limit of 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank Where a member is already holding 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of an UCB, it would not be necessary for him to subscribe to any additional share capital on account of the application of the extant share linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member may be required to hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or for an amount that is 5% of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.

## **Classification of Capital Funds**

Capital funds are divided into Tier I capital and Tier II capital. Elements of Tier II capital are reckoned as capital funds up to a maximum of 100 per cent of Tier I capital. Tier II capital may further be divided into upper and lower tiers. Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS), Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) and Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) would be treated as upper Tier II capital. Long Term Deposits would be treated as lower Tier II capital. PNCPS should not exceed 20 per cent of Tier I capital (excluding PNCPS). Long term deposit should not exceed 50 per cent of Tier I capital and that total Tier II should not exceed Tier I capital.

Tier II capital would be reckoned as capital funds for capital adequacy purpose even if a bank does not have Tier I capital up to March 31, 2013 for banks that are having CRAR less than the 9 per cent. However, during this period, for the purpose of capital adequacy requirement, lower Tier II capital alone would be restricted to 50 per cent of the prescribed CRAR and the progressive discount in respect of Tier II capital would, be applicable.

As at end March 2013, 1425 UCBs were complying with the regulating minimum of 9%.

## **Asset Classification and Provisioning Norms**

The asset classification and provisioning norms for Tier I UCBs are: (i) the 180 day loan delinquency norm for NPAs was extended by one year, *i.e*., up to March 31, 2009; (ii) the 12-month period for classification of a 'sub-standard' asset in 'doubtful' category by Tier I UCBs would be made effective from April 1, 2009 (iii) these banks would be required to provide 100 per cent on the secured portion of D-III advances ('doubtful' for more than 3 years) as on or after April 1, 2010; and (iv) for the outstanding stock of D-III advances as on March 31, 2010, banks would be required to provide: (a) 50 per cent as on March 31, 2010; (b) 60 per cent as on March 31, 2011; (c) 75 per cent as on March 31, 2012; and (d) 100 per cent as on March 31, 2013.

For Tier II banks, 100 per cent provisioning norms for advances classified as D-III would be applicable on or after April 1, 2007 Consequently, for the outstanding stock of D-III assets as on March 31, 2007, banks are required to provide: (a) 50 per cent up to March 31, 2007; (b) 60 per cent as on March 31, 2008; (c) 75 per cent as on March 31, 2009; (d) 100 per cent as on March 31, 2010.

UCBs can take recourse to the SARFAESI Act for recovery of NPAs.

**Weak UCBs** The UCBs are classified into strong and weak UCBs. The RBI revised the criteria for identification of weak UCBs in April 2002. A UCB is categorized as weak for the following reasons:

- The financial position is unsatisfactory, beyond specific threshold limits in terms of capital adequacy, *i.e.*, CRAR below 75 per cent of the statutory minimum.
- Its non-performing assets (NPA) are above 10 per cent but below 15 per cent of outstanding loans and advances.
- It has incurred net losses for two out of last three consecutive years.

Weak banks are required to draw up a time bound package for revival and the implementation of this package would be monitored by the RBI and the registrar of cooperative societies.

If a UCB exhibits one of the above three symptoms, it is identified as weak. If the condition of the UCB deteriorates even further in terms of either NPA or profitability along with capital adequacy, then UCB would classified as sick. Sick UCBs would then be put under moratorium or liquidation. The RBI has laid down guidelines for merger/amalgamation of UCBs of the following types, subject to the postmerger entity meeting the prescribed prudential norms:

- Net worth of the acquiree bank is positive and the acquirer bank assures to protect entire deposits of all the depositors of the acquired bank.
- When the net worth of the acquiree bank is negative, the acquirer bank on its own assures to protect deposits of all the depositors of the acquired bank.
- When the net worth of the acquiree bank is negative and the acquirer bank assures to protect the deposits of all the depositors with financial support from the state government extended upfront as part of the process of merger.

The RBI has also laid down norms for financial restructuring of the liabilities of the weak UCB as an additional option for resolution of problem banks provided they conform to the following norms:

- 1. The interest of small depositors has to be protected in full. Accordingly, no conversion into equity will be permitted in the case of small depositors, *i.e.*, depositor having deposit upto Rupees one lakh.
- 2. A portion of the deposit of individual depositors above Rupees one lakh may be converted into equity. Likewise, a portion of the deposits of the institutional depositors may be converted into Innovative Perpetual Debt Instrument (IPDI), which is eligible for inclusion as Tier I capital.
- 3. The conversion of deposits into equities and IPDI would be subject to consent of the depositors/ their forum.
- 4. Post-restructuring, no shares (equities) will be redeemed until the bank achieves a CRAR of 9 per cent.
- 5. The proportion of deposits converted into equity/IPDI should be such that the net worth of the bank after reconstruction turns positive.

- 6. The bank will have to maintain CRR/SLR on the restructured liabilities.
- 7. Post-restructuring, the management of the bank should be in the hands of a Board of Administrators consisting of representatives of individual depositors as well as professional bankers to ensure proper implementation of the reconstruction scheme including recovery of NPAs.

UCBs are graded into four categories on the basis of their financial performance. Grade I and II UCBs are relatively stronger banks and Grade III and IV are weak or sick banks.

UCBs fulfilling the following criteria would henceforth be termed as Financially Sound and Well-Managed (FSWM):

- (a) CRAR of not less than 10 per cent;
- (b) Gross NPA of less than 7% and Net NPAs of not more than 3%
- (c) Net profit for at least three out of the preceding four years subject to it not having incurred a net loss in the immediate preceding year.
- (d) No default in the maintenance of CRR/SLR during the preceding financial year;
- (e) Sound internal control system with at least two professional directors on the Board;
- (f) Core Banking Solution (CBS) fully implemented; and
- (g) Regulatory comfort.

## **Guidelines for merger of UCBs (having negative net worth) with DICGC support**

UCBs whose net worth was assessed negative through statutory inspections with reference to their financial position as on March 31, 2007 or earlier are eligible for merger with DICGC support. The UCB to be merged should be registered either in a State, which has signed MOU with the RBI or under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002, where RCS concerned assures to order merger in public interest as provided under the respective State Cooperative Societies Act or where CRCS prepares a scheme of amalgamation under Section 18 of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002. The scheme of merger should provide the proportion of deposits of the transferor bank, which will be paid by the transferee bank out of the 'readily realisable assets' of the transferor bank and from its own contribution, hereafter referred to as 'deposit coverage ratio'. The deposit coverage ratio shall not be less than 65 per cent. Higher deposit coverage ratio may be insisted upon depending upon the RBI assessment. The difference between the 'net outside liabilities' and 'net readily realisable assets', hereafter called the 'uncovered gap' would be met through contribution to be made by the transferee bank, claim on DICGC and sacrifice to be made by the large depositors.

Well managed and financially sound UCBs are allowed to open new branches/extension counters including off-site ATMs in the States that have signed MoUs with the Reserve Bank for supervisory and regulatory co-ordination and those registered under the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. They are also permitted to open NRE account subject to compliance with eligibility norms laid down by the RBI.

UCBs have created a separate niche for themselves. They have played a significant role in creating banking habits among the lower and middle income groups and in semi-urban credit delivery through their extensive networks. In the post liberalization era, many of the strong UCBs were involved in capital market scams: the 2001 Ketan Parekh scam and Home Trade Finance scam of 2002. Many of the depositors in Gujarat and provident funds in Maharashtra lost crores of rupees.

Moreover, the financial health of some UCBs has deteriorated due to high level of non-performing assets while some others are facing financial problems such as low capital base, lack of professionalism in conduct and management, poor recoveries, lack of funds for fresh deployment, mounting overdues, inadequate internal controls, and non-adherence to norms and regulations and low levels of diversification in business operations. Besides, there is increasing political clout on UCBs which acts as a constraint on their functioning. There is an absence of effective and coordinated regulation and supervision as they are under the regulatory control of multiple authorities. This is a major impediment to the strengthening and revitalization of this sector.

### **Rural Cooperative Banks**

Rural cooperative banks play an important role in the rural credit delivery system as they account for around 30 per cent of rural deposits and 44 per cent of the outstanding loans and advances of the banking system for agriculture and rural development. About 55 per cent of the short-term production loans for the agriculture sector come from cooperative credit institutions. Credit cooperatives form almost 70 per cent of the rural credit outlets. These rural cooperative banks receive refinance facility from NABARD.

- The non-interest income of a bank composes fee income, trading income on investments, income from foreign exchange operations and miscellaneous income
- Fee income represents the income earned on services provided by the bank like demand draft, telegraph transfers, distribution of third party products like mutual funds and insurance, and financial advisory services

**Short-term Structure of Rural Cooperative Banks** State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) are the apex institutions coordinating and regulating the working of Central Cooperative Banks (CCBs). They form the upper tier of short-term credit structure dispensing mainly short-and medium-term credit. As at end March 2015, there were 32 StCBs of which, 17 were scheduled StCBs included in the second schedule under section 42 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs)—the middle tier in the short-term structure of rural cooperative banks—channelise funds from the state cooperative banks to primary agricultural credit societies. Deposits constitute the major component of sources of funds followed by borrowings. There were 370 DCCBs on March 31, 2015.

Primary agricultural credit societies (PACSs) deal directly with the individual farmers, provide shortand medium-term credit, supply agricultural inputs and also arrange for marketing of produce of its members through a cooperative marketing society. PACSs are the grassroots level arms of the shortterm cooperative credit structure. As on end March 2015, there were 93,042 PACSs with membership of more than 13 crore of which, borrowing members at 4.81 crore constituted around 37 per cent. PACS is possibly one of the largest rural financial systems in the world. They are excluded from the scope of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Most of the PACSs are dependent on the finance provided by CCBs.

The financial health of a large number of PACSs has deteriorated. This is due to a large proportion of non-performing assets to total loans outstanding and erosion of funds and deposits. To improve the financial health of PACSs, NABARD provides financial support for computerization, human resource development, and so on. Short-term cooperatives dominate the rural co-operative credit structure. Its share is above 93 per cent of the total astets of the rural co-operative credit institutions.

NABARD is developing PACS as Multi Service Centres (MSCs) for:

- Establishment of agro service centres, rural retail outlets, agrimarketing infrastructure, rural warehouses, and procurement of agricultural produce;
- Collection and marketing of milk and poultry activities;
- Custom hiring of farm machinery or implements, transport vehicles for agricultural produce; and
- Strengthening forward and backward linkages through onlending to PACS members.

To enable PACS deliver more efficient financial and non-financial services in a viable manner to their members, PACS Development Cells (PDCs) have been created in DCCBs and StCBs.

**Long-term Structure of Rural Cooperative Banks** The long-term credit structure has only about 2,500 retail outlets as compared to over 1,00,000 retail outlets of the short-term credit structure. The longterm structure has a membership of about 16 million out of which 82 per cent are borrowing members. This structure provides medium and long-term loans for mechanization, animal husbandry, redeeming farmers' lands, improving farmers' lands, crop loans, gold loans, rural industries, and housing.

State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs) form the upper tier of longterm cooperative credit structure dispensing investment credit. There were 19 SCARDBs on March 31, 2015. SCARDBs provide long-term credit and are predominantly dependent on borrowings for their financial resources. With a view to strengthening their resource base, SCARDBs were permitted to mobilize fixed deposits for term of not less than twelve months. They can raise long-term deposits subject to certain conditions.

The primary cooperative agriculture and rural development banks (PCARDBs) are the lower tier of long-term credit cooperatives. The PCARDBs also provide long-term credit and are heavily dependent on borrowings. There were around 702 PCARDBs as on March 31, 2015.

The long-term credit cooperative banks were earlier known as land development banks. Their structure is much smaller in size and their business volume is also low as compared to the short-term structure. The long-term structure has lost its position as the dominant source of long-term credit on account of various factors such as limited range of long-term products and services offered, competition from short-term credit cooperative structure and commercial banks, infrequent interaction among members, and scattered lending.

More than 80 per cent of their resources are from borrowings and the remaining 20 per cent is in the form of contribution from members, government and deposits. Members of the cooperative banks are required to contribute 5 to 10 per cent of the loan applied as share capital at the time of availing loans. because of infrequent borrower contacts, the share capital does not increase which compels them to resort to higher borrowings. The borrowings are in the form of debentures floated with state government guarantee and these debentures are subscribed by the NABARD to the extent of 90–95 per cent and the remaining portion is subscribed by the Government of India (GOI) and the state government. SCARDBs borrow to meet the needs of the PCARDBs.

### **Short-term Structure of Rural Cooperative Banks**

- State cooperative banks form the upper tier.
- Central cooperative banks the middle tier
- Primary agricultural societies the lower tier.

• State cooperative agriculture and rural development Banks (SCARDBs) and primary cooperative agriculture and rural development banks form the upper and lower tiers respectively of long-term credit cooperatives.

**Regulation and Supervision** The RBI is the regulatory authority for StCBs and CCBs. Among the rural cooperative banks, only these two banks are covered under the scope of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The supervision of these two banks has been entrusted to NABARD. NABARD has constituted a board of supervision for rural cooperative banks.

A revival package for short-term credit cooperative structure was communicated to the state governments by the Government of India in January 2006. The Revival Package focuses on:

- Introducing legal and institutional reforms which will enable the cooperatives to function as autonomous member centric and member-governed institutions. These reforms will enable wider access to financial resources and investment opportunities, remove geographical restrictions in operations as well as provide administrative autonomy to cooperatives at all levels.
- Suitable amendments in the Banking Regulation Act and certain provisions in the NABARD Act.
- Providing resources for covering the accumulated losses.
- Providing for taking cooperatives to a minimum level of CRAR of 7 per cent.
- Meeting the costs of computerization and human resource development at all the levels of the shortterm credit structure.
- The sharing of the accumulated losses between GOI, state governments and the credit cooperative structure is based on the concept of origin of losses rather than any arbitrary proportions.

NABARD has been designated the implementing agency for implementing the revival package in all the states.

A revival package of ₹13,596 crore for the Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure for wiping out accumulated losses, covering invoked but unpaid guarantees given by State Governments, increasing the capital adequacy ratio to a minimum level of seven per cent and technical assistance including cost of audit, training, computerization was approved by the government wherein the Centre, State Governments and the Cooperative Credit Structure (CCS) would share the funding on a 68:28:4 ratio.

Based on the recommendation of Vaidyanathan Committee (VC-I), Government implemented a revival package for Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure (STCCS) encompassing legal and institutional reforms, measures to improve the quality of management and financial assistance as necessary for their democratic, self-reliant and efficient functioning. Under the revival package, Government of India released  $\bar{\xi}$ 9,245 crore. The said package was closed on 30th June, 2011.

The share of long term investment credit in agriculture is going down as compared to short term crop loan. This is severely hampering the asset creation in agriculture and allied activities. In order to give a boost to long term investment credit in agriculture, the Government set up "Long Term Rural Credit Fund" in NABARD for the purpose of providing refinance support to Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks with an initial corpus of  $\overline{55,000}$  crore.

The Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit (STCRC) – Refinance Fund was announced in Union Budget 2008–09 with initial corpus of  $\overline{5}5,000$  crore. In order to ensure increased and uninterrupted credit flow to farmers and to avoid high cost market borrowings by NABARD, the Government allocated an amount of  $\text{\textsterling}50,000$  crore for STCRC Fund during 2014–15.

 The number of unlicensed StCBs reduced from 17 to zero and the number of unlicensed DCCBs came down sharply from 296 to 23 by June 2013.

Recognizing the need to revamp ailing Cooperative Banks so that they are able to cater to the needs of farmers at their doorstep, the Government in 2014 announced implementation of the Scheme for Revival of 23 Unlicensed District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) in four States viz. 16 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in Jammu & Kashmir, 3 in Maharashtra and 1 in West Bengal. The total capital infusion required for revival of these 23 DCCBs was assessed to the tune of  $\overline{5}2375.42$  crore, out of which the commitment from Central Government was for  $\bar{\mathfrak{c}}$ 673.29 crore, for State Governments,  $\bar{\mathfrak{c}}$ 1464.59 crore and for National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD) it was  $\overline{2}237.54$  crore. The entire share of Central Government under the Scheme was released to NABARD for onward transmission to Cooperative Banks according to the terms and conditions prescribed in the Memorandum of Understanding governing the Scheme.

Significant progress has been made with respect to issuing licences to unlicensed DCCBs. With the implementation of the revival scheme announced by the central government in November 2014, the number of unlicensed DCCBs came down sharply from 23 to just 3 at the end of September 2016.

### **Conclusion**

The upper tier of both short-term and long-term rural cooperative credit institutions (StCBs, CCBs and SCARDBs) made profits during 2015–16, while the lower tier (PACS and PCARDBs) incurred overall losses. Asset quality in terms of NPA as a percentage of loans outstanding improved for all categories of rural cooperative banks, except PCARDBs, for which it remained at the previous year's level. The recovery performance of CCBs, PACS, and PCARDBs improved, while that of state cooperative banks StCBs and SCARDBs worsened. Asset quality and recovery performance of the long term rural credit institutions, especially SCARDBs,has improved. Both the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and rural banks will need to focus on semi-urban and rural areas for future growth.

Cooperative banks are an important segment in the Indian banking structure. Effective and coordinated regulation can strengthen and revitalise this sector.

### **Non-Banking Financial Companies**

Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) constitute an important segment of the financial system. NBFCs are financial intermediaries engaged primarily in the business of accepting deposits and delivering credit. They play an important role in channelizing the scarce financial resources to capital formation. NBFCs supplement the role of the banking sector in meeting the increasing financial needs of the corporate sector, delivering credit to the unorganized sector and to small local borrowers. But they differ from banks in many ways. An NBFC can accept deposit but not demand deposits and hence, they cannot raise low cost funds through savings or current accounts. Moreover, it is not a part of the payment and settlement system, cannot issue cheques drawn on itself and cannot borrow from the RBI. NBFCs have a more flexible structure than banks. As compared to banks, they can take quick decisions, assume greater risks, and tailor-make their services and charges according to the needs of the clients. Their flexible structure helps in broadening the market by providing the saver and investor a bundle of services on a competitive basis.

A non-banking financial company has been defined vide clause (b) of Section 45–1 of Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as (i) a financial institution, which is a company; (ii) a non-banking institution, which is a company and which has as its principal business the receiving of deposits under any scheme or arrangement or in any other manner or lending in any manner; (iii) such other non-banking institutions or class of such institutions, as the bank may with the previous approval of the central government and by notification in the official gazette, specify.

NBFC has been defined under Clause (xi) of Paragraph 2(1) of Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998, as: 'non-banking financial company' means only the non-banking institution which is a loan company or an investment company or a hire purchase finance company or an equipment leasing company or a mutual benefit finance company.

A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 engaged in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/ securities issued by Government or local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, insurance business, chit business but does not include any institution whose principal business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or providing any services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property. A non-banking institution which is a company and has principal business of receiving deposits under any scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in installments by way of contributions or in any other manner, is also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company).

NBFCs provide a range of services such as hire purchase finance, equipment lease finance, loans, and investments. Due to the rapid growth of NBFCs and a wide variety of services provided by them, there has been a gradual blurring of distinction between banks and NBFCs except that commercial banks have the exclusive privilege in the issuance of cheques.

However, NBFC cannot accept demand deposits, do not form part of the payment and settlement system and cannot issue cheques drawn on itself. Moreover, deposit insurance facility of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation is not available to depositors of NBFCs, unlike in case of banks.

NBFCs have raised large amount of resources through deposits from public, shareholders, directors, and other companies and borrowings by issue of non-convertible debentures. In the year 1998, a new concept of public deposits meaning deposits received from public, including shareholders in the case of public limited companies and unsecured debentures/bonds other than those issued to companies, banks, and financial institutions, was introduced for the purpose of focused supervision of NBFCs accepting such deposits.

The public funds are unlike public deposits, wholly the public funds do include public deposits, intercorporate deposits, bank finance and all other fundsthat were received either directly or indirectly from external sources such as funds raised by the issue of Commercial Papers, debentures, etc. The 'deposits' are defined under the RBI Act, 1934 as acceptance of money excluding those money raised by way of • NBFCs supplement the role of the banking sector in meeting the increasing financial needs of the corporate sector, delivering credit to the unorganized sector and to small, local borrowers. NBFCs have a more flexible structure than banks.
capital share, money received from banks and other financial institutions, money receivedas security deposit, earnest money and advance against goods or services and subscription to chits. All other source of money received as loan or in any collectiveform of amount is treated as deposits.

All Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are not entitled to accept public deposits. It also applies to CICs/CICs-ND-SI which cannot accept public deposits. Only those NBFCs to which the Bank had given a specific authorization and have an investment grade rating are allowed to accept or hold public deposits to a limit of 1.5 times of its Net Owned Funds. Those AFCs that do not get an investment grade rating by 31 March2016 will not be allowed to renew existing or accept fresh deposits thereafter. In the intervening period, i.e., till 31 March 2016, the unrated AFCs or those with a sub-investment grade rating can only renew their existing deposits on maturity and they cannot accept fresh deposits, till they obtain an investment grade rating.

However, as a matter of public policy, the Reserve Bank of India has decided that only the banks should be allowed to accept public deposits and as such has since 1997 not issued any Certificate of Registration (CoR) to new NBFCs for acceptance of public deposits.

Banks that also includes the state and rural co-operative banks can accept deposits and funds. Nonbanking finance companies, which have been issued Certificate of Registration by RBI with a specific licence to accept deposits, are entitled to accept public deposit. In other words, not all NBFCs registered with the Reserve Bank are entitled to accept deposits but only those that hold a deposit accepting Certificate of Registration can accept deposits. They can, however, accept deposits, only for a certain extent which is permissible. The Housing Finance Companies, which are again specifically authorized to collect deposits and companies authorized by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies Acceptance of Deposits Rules framed by the Central Government under the Companies Act, can also accept deposits also up to a certain limit. The Cooperative Credit Societies can accept deposits from their members but not from the general public. The Reserve Bank has regulated the method of accepting deposits only for f banks, cooperative banks and NBFCs.

Presently, the maximum rate of interest an NBFC can offer on deposits is 12.5 per cent. The interest may be paid or compounded at rests not shorter than monthly rests. The NBFCs are allowed to accept/ renew public deposits for a minimum period of 12 months and maximum period of 60 months. They cannot accept deposits repayable on demand, cannot offer gifts/incentives or any other additional benefit to the depositorsand should have minimum investment grade credit rating. The deposits with NBFCs are not insured and the repayment of deposits by NBFCs is not guaranteed by the RBI.

# **Types of NBFCs**

NBFCs are categorized a) in terms of the type of liabilities into deposit and non-deposit accepting NBFCs, b) non-deposit taking NBFCs by their size into systemically important and other non-deposit holding companies (NBFC-NDSI and NBFC-ND) and c) by the kind of activity they conduct. NBFCs whose asset size is of  $\bar{5}500$  croreor more as per the last audited balance sheet are considered as systemically important NBFCs. The rationale for such classification is that the activities of such NBFCs will have a bearing on the financial stability of the overall economy.

Within this broad categorization, the different types of NBFCs are as follows:

- **I. Asset Finance Company (AFC)**: An AFC is a company which is a financial institution carrying on as its principal business the financing of physical assets supporting productive/economic activity, such as automobiles, tractors, lathe machines, generator sets, earth moving and material handling equipment, moving on own power and general purpose industrial machines. The principal business for this purpose is defined as aggregate of financing real/physical assets supporting economic activity and income arising therefrom is not less than 60 per centof its total assets and total income respectively.
- **II. Investment Company (IC)**: IC means any company which is a financial institution carrying on as its principal business the acquisition of securities,
- **III. Loan Company (LC):**Loan companies are typical finance institutions that carryits sole purpose of providing financial benefits either by making loans or advances otherwise for any activity rather than its own but it does not come under the asset finance companies.

  - e. The loan to be extended without collateral.
  - f. The aggregate amount of loans, given for income generation is not less than 50 per cent of the total loans given by the MFIs.
  - g. Loan is repayable on weekly, fortnightly or monthly instalments at the choice of the borrower.
- **VIII. Non-Banking Financial Company Factors (NBFC-Factors):** NBFC-Factor is a non-deposit taking NBFC engaged in the principal business of factoring. The financial assets in the factoring business should constitute at least 50 per cent of its total assets and its income derived from factoring business should not be less than 50 per cent of its gross income. Every company seeking registration as NBFC-Factor shall have a minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) of  $\overline{5}5$  crore.
  - **IX. Mortgage Guarantee Companies (MGC):** MGC's are financial institutions for which at least 90 per centof the business turnover is mortgage guarantee business or at least 90 per centof the gross income is from mortgage guarantee business and the net owned fund is  $\overline{5}100$  crore.
  - **X. NBFC's Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC):** is a financial institution through which a promoter/promoter groups will be permitted to set up a new bank .It's a whollyowned Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) which will hold the bank as well as all other financial services companies regulated by RBI or other financial sector regulators, to the extent permissible under the applicable regulatory prescriptions.
  - **XI. NBFC-Account Aggregator:** At present, the financial asset holders such as holders of savings bank deposits, fixed deposits, mutual funds and insurance policies, get a scattered view of their financial asset holdings if the entities with whom these accounts are held fall under the purview of different financial sector regulators. This gap will be filled by account aggregators who will provide information on various accounts held by a customer in a consolidated, organized and retrievable manner. The option to avail the services of an account aggregator by a customer will be purely voluntary.

The draft directions governing NBFC-account aggregator (AA) were issued by the Reserve Bank in March 2016. Accordingly, the activities of NBFC-AA will be regulated by the Reserve Bank to ensure that the nature and terms of its services conform to prescribed standards. As per these guidelines, the business of an account aggregator will be entirely driven by information technology (IT). The account aggregator will not support any transaction in financial assets by its customers. The account aggregator will not undertake any business other than the business of account aggregation. However, the deployment of investible surplus by the aggregator in instruments which isnot for trading will be permitted. Pricing of services will be as per the boardapproved policy of the account aggregator.

The account aggregator will ensure that the provision of services to a customer, who has made a specific application for availing such services, will be backed by appropriate agreements/ authorizations between the aggregator, customer and financial service provider. The information will be shared by the account aggregator only with the customer to whom it relates or any other person authorized by the customer. The account aggregator will be bound by the terms and conditions of the licence (such as customer protection, grievance redressal, data security, audit control, corporate governance and risk management framework). The account aggregator will have a Citizen Charter that explicitly guarantees the protection of the rights of customers.

### **Other Categories of NBFCs**

**Residuary Non-banking Companies:** RNBCs are a class of NBFCs that cannot be classified as equipmentleasing, hire purchase, loan, investment, nidhi, or chit fund companies, but which tap public savingsby operating various deposit schemes, akin to recurring deposit schemes of banks. The deposit acceptanceactivities of these companies are governed by the provisions of Residuary Non-Banking Companies(Reserve Bank) Directions, 1987. Residuary Non-banking Companies (RNBCs) are required to be mandatorilyregistered with Reserve Bank of India RNBCs had a strong presence in the rural areas. Theymobilized a large amount of deposits from the rural population. They generally lent funds to groupcompanies, subsidiaries and associates which led to concentration of risk, thereby resulting in loanlosses and lack of public confidence. To safeguard the interest of depositors, the RBI directed RNBCsto invest not less than 80 per cent of aggregate deposit liabilities as per the investment pattern prescribedby it and to entrust these securities to all public sector banks to be withdrawn only for payment of deposits.

Subject to compliance with the investment pattern, they can invest 20 per cent of aggregate liabilitiesor ten times its net owned fund, whichever is lower, in a manner decided by its board of directors.

The RNBCs are the only class of NBFCs for which the floor rate of interest for deposits is specified by the RBI while there is no upper limit prescribed for them. The floor interest rate prescribed is 3.5 per cent per annum (to be compounded annually) on daily deposit schemes and 5 per cent per annum (to be compounded annually) on other deposit schemes of higher duration or term deposits. The RBI hasalso prescribed prudential norms for RNBCs. Compliance with prudential norms is mandatory and aprerequisite for acceptance of deposits. The RBI monitors and inspects these RNBCs from time to time.

There were three RNBCs registered with the RBI. The regulator converted one of the three companies with miniscule deposit into a non-deposit taking NBFC. The two large RNBCs such as Peerless General Finance and Investment Company and Sahara Finance Limited haveagreed to migrate to another business model and have wound up their operations.

**Mutual Benefit Financial Companies:** Mutual benefit financial companies (Nidhis) are NBFCs notified under Section 620 A of the Companies Act, 1956, and primarily regulated by the department of company affairs (DCA) under the directions/guidelines issued by them under Section 637A of the Companies Act, 1956. The Sabanayagam Committee on Nidhis defines Nidhi as a company formed with the exclusive object of cultivating the habit of thrift, savings and functioning for the mutual benefit of members by receiving deposits only from individuals enrolled as members and by lending only to individuals, also enrolled as members, and which functions as per notification and guidelines prescribed by the Department of Company Affairs (DCA). These companies are exempt from the core provisions of the RBI Act and NBFC directions relating tothe acceptance of public deposits. However, the Reserve Bank is empowered to issue directions in mattersrelating to deposit acceptance activities and directions relating to ceiling on interest rate.

They are also required to maintain register of deposits, furnish receipt to depositors, and submit returns to the RBI. In order to facilitate healthy functioning of Nidhi companies and restore the confidence of the investing public, the Government of India constituted in March 2000, an expert committee under the chairmanship of Shri P. Sabanayagam to suggest an appropriate policy framework for the overall improvement of these companies. The committee submitted its report to the government on 28 September 2000 which includedrecommendations such as entry point barriers, minimum capital funds, liquid assets requirements, restrictions on dividend, ceiling on interest rates on deposit and loans, regulations of various managerial aspects, disclosure norms, prudential norms, adequate supervisory framework, role of auditors, and other measures for protection of depositors' interest.

**Miscellaneous Non-banking Companies:** Miscellaneous Non-banking Companies (MNBCs) are companies engaged in the chit fund business. The term 'deposit' as defined under Section 45I(bb) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, does not include subscription to chit funds. The chit fund companies are exempted from all the core provisions of Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act. The RBI regulates only the deposits accepted by these companies, but it does not regulate their chit fund business. Chit fund company means a company managing, conducting or supervising, as foremen, agent or in any other capacity, chits as defined in Section 2 of the Chit Funds Act, 1982. Section 2(b) of the Chit Fund Act, 1982 defines a chit as a transaction whether called chit, chit fund, chitty, kuri or by any other name by or under which a person enters into an agreement with a specified number of persons that every one of them shall subscribe a certain sum of money (or a certain quantity of grain instead) by way of periodical instalments over a definite period and that each such subscriber shall, in his turn, as determinedbylot or by auction or by tender or in such other manner as may be specified in the chit agreement, be entitled to the prize amount.

A transaction is not a chit within the meaning of this clause, if in such transaction some alone, but not all, of the subscribers get the prize amount without any liability to pay future subscriptions; or all the subscribers get the chit amount by turns with a liability to pay future subscriptions. Thechit fund business is administered by the respective state governments through the officesof registrars of chits. Chit fund companies, as per the Miscellaneous Non-banking Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, can accept deposits up to 25 per cent and 15 per cent of the net owned fund (NOF) from public and shareholders, respectively, for a period of 6 months to 36 months, but cannot accept deposits repayable on demand/ notice.

Chit funds activity involves contributions by members in instalments by way of subscription to the chit and by rotation each member of the chit receives the chit amount. The subscriptions are specifically excluded from the definition of deposits and cannot be termed as deposits. While chit funds may collect subscriptions as above, they are prohibited by RBI from accepting deposits with effect from August 2009. Chit fund companies are regulated under the Chit Fund Act, 1982, which is a central act, and is implemented by the State governments. In case any chit fund is accepting public deposits, RBI can prosecute such chit funds.

#### **Regulation of NBFCs**

In the 1960s, the RBI made an attempt to regulate NBFCs by issuing directions relating to the maximum amount of deposits, the period of deposits, and rate of interest they could offer on the deposits accepted. Norms were laid down regarding maintenance of certain percentage of liquid assets, creation of reserve funds, and transfer there to every year a certain percentage of profit, and so on. These directions and norms were revised and amended from time to time. In 1977, the RBI issued two separate sets of guidelines, namely, (i) NBFC Acceptance of Deposits Directions, 1977, for NBFCs and (ii) MNBD Directions, 1977, for MNBCs. These directions were related to deposit-taking activities of NBFCs. The reserve bank made an attempt to regulate the asset side of NBFCs in 1994 in pursuance of the Shah Committee recommendations. However, it was not empowered to regulate the asset side of NBFCs.

NBFCs became prominent in the first half of the 1990s. The growth in aggregate deposits of NBFCs outpaced that of banks. However, bank finance to NBFCs dried up in 1995 after the RBI cautioned banks against such lending. Therefore, NBFCs had to depend on fixed deposits often at ratesup to 26 per cent. To service high-cost deposits, NBFCs invested in bought-out deals, shares, real estate and corporate financing, the areas in which they had little experience. The slackness in the capital and real estate markets and general industrial activities resulted in sharp deterioration in NBFC's quality of assets. Crores of rupees of small investors disappeared overnight as NBFCs like CRB Capital Markets, JVG Finance, and Prudential Capital Markets failed in 1997. This shook the investor confidence which resulted in a rush of withdrawals of public deposits. This is the only sector which had a number of committees trying to regulate its working. The first was the Shah Committee in 1992. It was followed by the Shere Committee, Khanna Committee and various committees of the RBI. In 1997, the RBI Act was amended and the Reserve Bank was given comprehensive powers to regulate NBFCs. The amended act made it mandatory for every NBFC to obtain a certificate of registration and have minimum net owned funds. Ceilings were prescribed for acceptance of deposits, capital adequacy, credit rating and net-owned funds. Net owned fund (NOF) of NBFCs is the aggregate of paid-up capital and free reserves, netted by (i) the amount of accumulated balance of loss; and (ii) the deferred revenue expenditure and other intangible assets, if any, and further reduced by investments in shares and loans and advances to (a) subsidiaries; (b) companies in the same group and (c) other NBFCs, in excess of 10 per cent of owned fund. Norms relating to capital adequacy, credit rating exposure, asset classification and so on were laid down. The Reserve Bank also developed a comprehensive system to supervise NBFCs accepting/holding public deposits. Directions were also issued to the statutory auditors to report noncompliance with the RBI Act and regulations to the RBI, board of directors and shareholders of the NBFCs. The task force constituted by Government of India under the Chairmanship of Shri C. M. Vasudev submitted its report on 28 October 1998, after reviewing the existing regulatory framework for NBFCs.

The Government of India framed the Financial Companies Regulation Bill, 2000; to implement the recommendations requiring statutory changes, as also consolidatedthe law, relating to NBFCs and unincorporated bodies with a view to ensuring depositor protection. According to this bill, all the NBFCs will be known as financial companies instead of NBFCs.

The Reserve Bank of India has issued detailed directions on prudential norms, vide Non-Banking Financial (Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2007, Non-Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (non-deposit accepting or holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015 and Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (non-deposit accepting or holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015. Applicable regulations vary based on the deposit acceptance or systemic importance of the NBFC. The directions inter alia, prescribe guidelines on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning requirements applicable to NBFCs, exposure norms, disclosures in the balance sheet, requirement of capital adequacy, restrictions on investments in land and building and unquoted shares, loan to value (LTV) ratio for NBFCs predominantly engaged in business of lending against gold jewellery, besides others. Deposit accepting NBFCs have also to comply with the statutory liquidity requirements.

**Capital Requirements:** (1) Every applicable NBFC shall maintain a minimum capital ratio consisting of Tier I and Tier II capital which shall not be less than 15 per cent of its aggregate risk weighted assets on-balance sheet and of risk adjusted value of off-balance sheet items. (2) The Tier I capital in respect of applicable NBFCs (other than NBFC-MFI and IDFNBFC), at any point of time, shall not be less than 8.5 per centby 31 March 2016 and10 per centby 31 March 2017. (3) Applicable NBFCs primarily engaged in lending against gold jewellery (such loans comprising 50 per cent or more of their financial assets) shall maintain a minimum Tier l capital of 12 per cent.

The regulation on non-deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than  $\overline{500}$  crore is as follows:

- i. They shall not be subjected to any regulation either prudential or conduct of business regulations namely, Fair Practices Code (FPC), KYC, etc., if they have not accessed any public funds and do not have a customer interface.
- ii. Those having customer interface will be subjected only to conduct of business regulations including FPC, KYC, etc., if they are not accessing public funds.
- iii. Those accepting public funds will be subjected to limited prudential regulations but not conduct of business regulations if they have no customer interface.
- iv. Where both public funds are accepted and customer interface exist, such companies will be subjected both to limited prudential regulations and conduct of business regulations.

## **Growth of NBFCs**

NBFCs in India have existed since long. They came into limelight in the second half of the 1980s and in the first half of the 1990s. NBFCs flourished during the stock market boom of the early 1990s. In the initial years of liberalization, they not only became prominent in a wide range of activities but they outpaced banks in deposit rising owing to their customized services. They have backed many small entrepreneurs. They have also lent small-ticket personal loans of size of  $\bar{\tau}25,000$  to customers and thereby fuelled the consumption boom. Total assets/liabilities of NBFCs grew at an average annual rate of 36.7 per cent during the 1990s (1991–98) as compared to 20.9 per cent during the 1980s (1981–91). The growing importance of this segment and the surfacing of some scams compelled the RBI to increase this regulatory attention.

Almost all corporate houses have set up their own NBFCS. Big banks also floated NBFCs to tap certain segments on which restrictions were imposed by the regulator. Banks through the NBFCs could generously lend funds to promoters to raise theirholdings through a creeping acquisition. 'Citi Financial' is one of the oldest foreign bank-owned NBFC and a pioneer in this segment. There has been an increase in the number of NBFCs, especially those floated by foreign banks as there are strictures on branch licensing. The Reserve Bank tightened these NBFC norms in November 2006 to reduce the regulatory arbitrage between different financial sector players. According to the guidelines, non-deposit taking NBFCs which have assets of over 100 crore will be subject to exposure and capital adequacy norms. Banks will not be able to lend indiscriminately to them. Nor will they be allowed to hold more than 10 per cent equity stake in deposit-taking NBFCs. Moreover, the foreign banks with NBFC subsidiaries will be required to include the activities of their NBFC arms in their reporting to the Reserve Bank.

Two sets of players such as small and large NBFCshave emerged in the market. The small NBFCs rely more on deposit taking while large NBFCs focus on asset financing and rely less on deposit-taking. The large NBFCs, especially M & M Finance, DBS Cholamandalam Finance and Shriram Transport Finance have specialized skills in credit intermediation and have a collective asset base of around 17,000 crore. These NBFCs are the leaders in financing used and new commercial vehicles, tractors and automobiles. NBFCs such as Citibank and GE have built large consumer-focused asset portfolios by offering personal loans, insurance and various other services thereby directly competing with banks. Banks, too, are entering into high-yield and high-risk financing nichesegments of NBFCs. Banks have an edge over NBFCs as they have access to low-cost deposits while NBFCs have to rely more on high cost public deposits, bank and market borrowings to fund their balance sheets. Borrowings account for almost 65 per cent of total NBFC liabilities, of which, non-convertible debentures is a major component followed by bank borrowings. The NBFCs now borrow from mutual funds by placing debentures with them. Borrowing from mutual funds is simple as there are little or no margins. NBFCS get the debentures rated by a credit rating agency and a good rating helps them raise funds.

The NBFC sector continued to raise funds mainly through debentures, borrowings from banks and commercial papers. The Reserve Bank also eased the norms for external commercial borrowings (ECBs) for NBFCs that lend to the infrastructure sector, to raise ECBs with a minimum maturity of five years. In addition, the Reserve Bank also allowed NBFCs to raise funds through rupee denominated bonds overseas. Public deposits garnered by NBFCs-D have been showing a rising trend since 2010.

Consolidation has taken place within the NBFC sector resulting in a reduction in the number of both NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND-SI. Their assets continued to register substantial growth. The accelerated growth in credit deployment by NBFCs was due to their ability to contain risks and tap demand in niche markets. The profitability of NBFCs was significantly higher as compared to commercial banks and their NPAs have grown but have remained low compared to the banks.

## **Conclusion**

NBFCs in India have become prominent in a wide range of activities like hire purchase finance, equipment lease finance, loans and investments. NBFCs have greater reach and flexibility in tapping resources.

In desperate times, NBFCs could survive owing to their aggressive character and customized services. NBFCs are doing more fee-based business than fund-based. They are focusing now on retail sector, housing finance, personal loans and marketing of insurance. Many of the NBFCs have ventured into the domain of mutual funds and insurance. NBFCs undertake both life and general insurance business as joint venture participants in insurance companies. The strong NBFCs have successfully emerged as 'financial institutions' in a short span of time and are in the process of converting themselves into 'financial supermarket', a one-stop financial shop. The NBFCs are taking initiatives to establish a self-regulatory organization (SRO). At present, NBFCs are represented by the Association of Leasing and Financial Services (ALPS), Federation of Indian Hire Purchase Association (FIHPA), and Equipment Leasing Association of India (ELA). The RBI wants these three industry bodies to come together under one roof. The RBI has emphasized the formation of SRO particularly for the benefit of smaller NBFCs.

The NBFC sector assumes a critical role in financial inclusion as it caters to a wide range of financial activities particularly in areas where commercial banks have limited penetration. NBFCs are expected to play a crucial role in fostering inclusive growth, especially in sectors like MSMEs.

## **SUMMARY**

- 1. Banks are one of the oldest financial intermediaries in the financial system. They play an important role in the mobilization of deposits and disbursement of credit to various sectors of the economy. The creation of credit is an important function of a bank and this function distinguishes banks from the non-banking institutions. Banks create deposits in the process of their lending operations.
- 2. For centuries, banks have borrowed and lent money to business, trade, and people, charging interest on loans and paying interest on deposits. These two functions are the core activities of banking.
- 3. In terms of ownership and function, commercial banks can be classified into four categories: public sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks in India, and regional rural banks. There are 80 scheduled commercial banks—27 public sector banks, 21 in the private sector and 32 foreign banks.
- 4. Banks depend on deposits and non-deposits to meet their resource requirements. Deposits constitute the largest source of funds for the banks. Banks mobilize deposits from the household sector, corporate sector, financial institutions, rest of world-non-resident (NRI)

and foreign consulates and embassies-deposits, and government. Banks raise deposits in the form of time and demand deposits.

- 5. Banks raise non-deposit resources through public issues—both debt and equity—in the domestic capital market and borrowings both at home and abroad. Banks raise short-term funds by borrowing in the call/notice money market, repo market and CBLO market. Banks also resort to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and interbank borrowings in India and abroad to raise funds.
- 6. Lending or the extension of credit is the major activity of a commercial bank. Banks in India have traditionally been the main source of credit for small borrowers and various sectors of the economy such as agriculture, industry, infrastructure, services and government.
- 7. Banks provide short-term credit for seasonal agricultural operations such as crop cultivation and long-term credit for creation of assets. In order to ensure that the bank credit flowed to the vital sectors of the economy and according to national priorities, the concept of priority sector lending was developed. The broad sectors under the revised norms include agriculture (both direct and indirect), small enterprises (direct and indirect), retail trade in essential commodities and consumer cooperatives stores, micro credit, education loans and housing loans. The RBI has stipulated a target of 40 per cent of adjusted net bank credit (ANBC) or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, for lending to the priority sector by both public and private sector scheduled banks. Within this, sub-targets of 18 per cent and 10 per cent of adjusted net bank credit or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, respectively, have been stipulated for lending to agriculture and weaker sections of the population. A target of 32 per cent of adjusted net bank credit has been stipulated for lending to the priority sector by foreign banks.
- 8. Banks finance both short-term working capital and long-term requirements of industry. Banks also finance infrastructure projects by way of term loans, bonds and guarantees. For funding large infrastructure projects, banks also syndicate loans - in which different banks come forward to share the loan amount. Banks also lend to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the private sector, registered under Companies Act for directly undertaking infrastructure projects.
- 9. Banks lend funds to the household sector in the form of housing loans, auto loans, advances to individuals against fixed deposits, credit card, educational loans and loans for purchase of consumer durables. These are categorized as retail loans as the average size of loans is very small and loans are widely distributed over a large number of borrowers.
- 10. Banks extend need based working capital facilities as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI and engaged in equipment leasing, hire-purchase, loan, factoring and investment activities. Banks also extend financial assistance to support the factoring business of Factoring Companies.
- 11. Commercial banks invest in two types of securities: SLR securities and non-SLR securities. Investment of banks in government securities and other approved securities is categorized as SLR investments. In1985, the domain of eligible investments of SCBs was enlarged to cover commercial paper (CP), units of mutual funds, shares and debentures of public sector undertakings (PSUs) and private corporate sector, which are all known as non-SLR investments.
- 12. The Government of India set up the Narasimham Committee (1991) to examine all aspects relating to structure, organization, and functioning of the Indian banking system. The recommendations of the committee aimed at creating a competitive and efficient banking system. Measures like capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification, norms for investment, entry of private sector banks, gradual reduction of SLR and CRR were recommended and implemented to strengthen the banking system. These recommendations changed the face of Indian Banking.
- 13. Technology has made the banking business truly international and efficient. Technology will act not only as the facilitator but a catalyst to reach out and meet expectations of demanding customers. More

than 95 per cent of the branches have been fully computerized and 50 per cent of these branches have core-banking solutions (CBS), which is automation of banks across multiple-delivery channels.

- 14. A payments system comprises of a set of rules, institutions, and technology for transfer of funds from one entity to another. It constitutes the core of a well-functioning financial system as the failure of a payment system may result in a systemic risk thereby triggering bank runs. There are two kinds of payment system in operationretail and large value payment systems. Retail payment system comprises of paper-based payment system, and electronic payment systems like the electronic clearing services (ECS), NEFT and card payment system. Large Value Payment System consists of the real time gross settlement system (RTGS), government securities clearing and foreign exchange clearing.
- 15. In the post-liberalization era, public sector banks have diversified to non-traditional activities such as mutual funds, merchant banking, venture capital funding, and other para-banking activities such as leasing, hire purchase, and factoring.
- 16. Globally, bank mergers have increased for improving the structure and efficiency of the banking industry. This phenomenon of bank mergers is a relatively recent one in India. Mergers have gained importance on account of globalization, increasing competition, technological changes, and redefinition of takeovers.
- 17. Public sector banks were allowed to raise capital from the capital market to strengthen their capital adequacy ratios and reduce the holdings of the government/RBI. The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/1980 and the State Bank of India Act, 1955 were amended to allow banks to raise capital not exceeding 49 per cent of their equity. The State Bank of India was the first public sector bank to tap the equity market in December 1993.
- 18. Banking is the business of money where high risks are involved. Deregulation and globalization have introduced new types of risks. Risk may be defined as an exposure to a transaction with loss, which occurs with some probability and which can be expected, measured and minimized. An element of risk is inherent in the banking operations. Thus, risk management is necessary to ensure sound , stable and efficient banking system. It is a continuous process which helps identify the amount and type of risks that the bank is willing to take, mobilize enough capital to cover such risks and allocate capital to profitable business units. Risk management involves identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks to optimize risk-reward trade-off.
- 19. Banks use a variety of tools to manage their risks which include hedging the credit risks by resorting to restricting fresh exposures, outright sale of an existing fund based exposure, obtaining credit guarantee cover, and more recently securitization. Banks have adopted asset-liability management and stress testing as tools of risk management.
- 20. The RBI issued prudential norms based on the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee report. The major objective of prudential norms was to ensure financial safety, soundness, and solvency of banks. These norms strive to ensure that banks conduct their business activities as prudent entities, *i.e.*, not indulging in excessive risk taking and violating regulations in pursuit of profit. Banking reforms were initiated by implementing prudential norms consisting of capital adequacy ratio, asset classification, income recognition, and provisioning.
- 21. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) prepared a framework through a consultative process to secure international convergence of supervisory regulations governing the capital adequacy of international banks. This framework was finalized in 1988 and is known as the Basel Accord or Basel I. The objectives of Basel I were two-fold: (i) serve to strengthen the soundness and stability of the international banking system and (ii) to diminish an existing source of competitive inequality among international banks. The three main components of the Basel I framework were constituents of capital, the risk weighting system, and the target ratio. The central focus of this framework was

credit risk and especially, country transfer risk. Basel I prescribed two tiers of capital for the banks: Tier I capital which can absorb losses without a bank being required to cease trading and Tier II capital which can absorb losses in the event of a winding-up. The Basel I capital adequacy norms were criticized as several deficiencies surfaced.

- 22. The New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars that allow banks and supervisors to evaluate properly the various risks that the banks face. The New Basel Capital Accord focuses on the following.
  - Minimum capital requirements, which seek to refine the measurement framework set out in the 1988 accord.
  - Supervisory review of an institution's capital adequacy and internal assessment process.
  - Market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices.
- 23. A new category of scheduled banks came into existence in 1975 when 6 regional rural banks (RRBs) came into existence under the Regional Rural Banks Ordinance, 1975. The major objective of setting up RRBs was to develop the rural economy by providing for the purpose of development of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry, and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans, and small entrepreneurs. A process of state-wise amalgamation of RRBs sponsored by the same sponsor bank was initiated in 2005 to take advantages of the economies of scale and reduce their operational costs.
- 24. Local Area banks are set up in district towns, and hence their focus of lending will be to agriculture and allied activities, SSI, agro-industrial activities, trading activities and the non-farm sector with a view to ensuring the provision of timely and adequate credit to the local clientele in the area of operation. The area of operation of the bank is a maximum of three geographically neighbouring districts and they are allowed to open branches only in their area of operation.
- 25. Cooperative banks fill in the gaps of banking needs of small and medium income groups not adequately met through by the public and private sector banks. The cooperative banking system supplements the efforts of the commercial banks in mobilizing savings and meeting the credit needs of the local population. The cooperative credit sector in India comprises rural cooperative credit institutions and urban cooperative banks. The rural cooperative credit institutions comprise of institutions such as state cooperative banks, district central cooperative banks, and primary agricultural credit societies, which specialize in short-term credit, and institutions such as state cooperative agriculture and rural development banks
